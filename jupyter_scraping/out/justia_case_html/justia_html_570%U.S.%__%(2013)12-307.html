When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.  Windsor sought to claim the federal estate tax exemption for surviving spouses, but was barred from doing so by \xc2\xa73 of the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), which amended the Dictionary Act\xe2\x80\x94a law providing rules of construction for over 1,000 federal laws and the whole realm of federal regulations\xe2\x80\x94to define \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspouse\xe2\x80\x9d as excluding same-sex partners.  Windsor paid $363,053 in estate taxes and sought a refund, which the Internal Revenue Service denied.  Windsor brought this refund suit, contending that DOMA violates the principles of equal protection incorporated in the \n \nFifth Amendment.  While the suit was pending, the Attorney General notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives that the Department of Justice would no longer defend \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  In response, the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) of the House of Representatives voted to intervene in the litigation to defend \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  The District Court permitted the intervention.  On the merits, the court ruled against the United States, finding \xc2\xa73 unconstitutional and ordering the Treasury to refund Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s tax with interest.  The Second Circuit affirmed.  The United States has not complied with the judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction to consider the merits of the case.  This case clearly presented a concrete disagreement between opposing parties that was suitable for judicial resolution in the District Court, but the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to defend \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality in court while continuing to deny refunds and assess deficiencies introduces a complication.  Given the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concession, amicus contends, once the District Court ordered the refund, the case should have ended and the appeal been dismissed.  But this argument elides the distinction between Article III\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional requirements and the prudential limits on its exercise, which are \xe2\x80\x9cessentially matters of judicial self-governance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warth v. Seldin, \n\n422 U.\xc2\xa0S. 490\n.  Here, the United States retains a stake sufficient to support Article III jurisdiction on appeal and in this Court.  The refund it was ordered to pay Windsor is \xe2\x80\x9ca real and immediate economic injury,\xe2\x80\x9d Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587\n, even if the Executive disagrees with \xc2\xa73 of DOMA.  Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.  Cf. INS v. Chadha, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPrudential considerations, however, demand that there be \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Baker v. Carr, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186\n.  Unlike Article III requirements\xe2\x80\x94which must be satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is appropriate\xe2\x80\x94prudential factors that counsel against hearing this case are subject to \xe2\x80\x9ccountervailing considerations [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warth, supra, at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  One such consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the issues is ensured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with vigor the legislative act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.  See Chadha, supra, at 940.  Here, BLAG\xe2\x80\x99s substantial adversarial argument for \xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality satisfies prudential concerns that otherwise might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which the principal parties agree.  This conclusion does not mean that it is appropriate for the Executive as a routine exercise to challenge statutes in court instead of making the case to Congress for amendment or repeal.  But this case is not routine, and BLAG\xe2\x80\x99s capable defense ensures that the prudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which is of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to hundreds of thousands of persons.

Congress has enacted discrete statutes to regulate the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy, but  DOMA, with a directive applicable to over 1,000 federal statues and the whole realm of federal regulations, has a far greater reach.  Its operation is also directed to a class of persons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect.  Assessing the validity of that intervention requires discussing the historical and traditional extent of state power and authority over marriage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSubject to certain constitutional guarantees, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, \xe2\x80\x9cregulation of domestic relations\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9can area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States,\xe2\x80\x9d Sosna v. Iowa, \n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393\n.  The significance of state responsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s beginning; for \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Constitution was adopted the common understanding was that the domestic relations of husband and wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States,\xe2\x80\x9d Ohio ex\xc2\xa0rel. Popovici v. Agler, \n\n280 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379\n\xe2\x80\x93384.  Marriage laws may vary from State to State, but they are consistent within each State.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA rejects this long-established precept.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.  But the Federal Government uses the state-defined class for the opposite purpose\xe2\x80\x94to impose restrictions and disabilities.  The question is whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty protected by the \n \nFifth Amendment, since what New York treats as alike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the same class the State seeks to protect.  New York\xe2\x80\x99s actions were a proper exercise of its sovereign authority.  They reflect both the community\xe2\x80\x99s considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning of equality.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0By seeking to injure the very class New York seeks to protect, DOMA violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of equality \xe2\x80\x9cmust at the very least mean that a bare congressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot\xe2\x80\x9d justify disparate treatment of that group.  Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, \n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528\n\xe2\x80\x93535.  DOMA cannot survive under these principles.  Its unusual deviation from the tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage operates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with federal recognition of their marriages.  This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of a class recognized and protected by state law.  DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s avowed purpose and practical effect are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA\xe2\x80\x99s history of enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute.  It was its essence.  BLAG\xe2\x80\x99s arguments are just as candid about the congressional purpose.   DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s operation in practice confirms this purpose.  It frustrates New York\xe2\x80\x99s objective of eliminating inequality by writing inequality into the entire United States Code.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA\xe2\x80\x99s principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of state-sanctioned marriages.  It contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State.  It also forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.

Edith Windsor and Thea Spyer returned to their home in New York City.  When Spyer died in 2009, she left her entire estate to Windsor.  Windsor sought to claim the estate tax exemption for surviving spouses.  She was barred from doing so, however, by a federal law, the Defense of Marriage Act, which excludes a same-sex partner from the definition of \xe2\x80\x9cspouse\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in federal statutes.  Windsor paid the taxes but filed suit to challenge the constitutionality of this provision.  The United States District Court and the Court of Appeals ruled that this portion of the statute is unconstitutional and ordered the United States to pay Windsor a refund.  This Court granted certiorari and now affirms the judgment in Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s favor.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1996, as some States were beginning to consider the concept of same-sex marriage, see, e.g., Baehr v. Lewin, 74 Haw. 530, 852 P.\xc2\xa02d 44 (1993), and before any State had acted to permit it, Congress enacted the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), \n\n110Stat.\n2419.  DOMA contains two operative sections: Section 2, which has not been challenged here, allows States to refuse to recognize same-sex marriages performed under the laws of other States.

It amends the Dictionary Act in Title 1, \xc2\xa77, of the United States Code to provide a fed- eral definition of \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 3 of DOMA provides as follows:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, or of any ruling, regulation, or interpretation of the various administrative bureaus and agencies of the United States, the word \xe2\x80\x98marriage\xe2\x80\x99 means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife, and the word \xe2\x80\x98spouse\xe2\x80\x99 refers only to a person of the opposite sex who is a husband or a wife.\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe definitional provision does not by its terms forbid States from enacting laws permitting same-sex marriages or civil unions or providing state benefits to residents in that status.  The enactment\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive definition of marriage for purposes of all federal statutes and other regulations or directives covered by its terms, however, does control over 1,000 federal laws in which marital or spousal status is addressed as a matter of federal law.

Windsor and Spyer registered as domestic partners when New York City gave that right to same-sex couples in 1993.  Concerned about Spyer\xe2\x80\x99s health, the couple made the 2007 trip to Canada for their marriage, but they continued to reside in New York City.  The State of New York deems their Ontario marriage to be a valid one.

Because DOMA denies federal recognition to same-sex spouses, Windsor did not qualify for the marital exemption from the federal estate tax, which excludes from taxation \xe2\x80\x9cany interest in property which passes or has passed from the decedent to his surviving spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72056(a).

The Internal Revenue Service denied the refund, concluding that, under DOMA, Windsor was not a \xe2\x80\x9csurviving spouse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Windsor commenced this refund suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  She contended that DOMA violates the guarantee of equal protection, as applied to the Federal Government through the \n \nFifth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile the tax refund suit was pending, the Attorney General of the United States notified the Speaker of the House of Representatives, pursuant to \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7530D, that the Department of Justice would no longer defend the constitutionality of DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa73.

The Department of Justice has submitted many \xc2\xa7530D letters over the years refusing to defend laws it deems unconstitutional, when, for instance, a federal court has rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s defense of a statute and has issued a judgment against it.  This case is unusual, however, because the \xc2\xa7530D letter was not preceded by an adverse judgment.  The letter instead reflected the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s own conclusion, relying on a definition still being debated and considered in the courts, that heightened equal protection scrutiny should apply to laws that classify on the basis of sexual orientation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough \xe2\x80\x9cthe President .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. instructed the Department not to defend the statute in Windsor,\xe2\x80\x9d he also decided \xe2\x80\x9cthat Section 3 will continue to be enforced by the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x9d and that the United States had an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in providing Congress a full and fair opportunity to participate in the litigation of those cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 191\xe2\x80\x93193.

Before this Court acted on the petition, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  It applied heightened scrutiny to classifications based on sexual orientation, as both the Department and Windsor had urged.  The United States has not complied with the judg- ment.

Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587, \n599 (2007)\n (plurality opinion) (emphasis deleted).  Windsor suffered a redressable injury when she was required to pay estate taxes from which, in her view, she was exempt but for the alleged invalidity of \xc2\xa73 of DOMA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe decision of the Executive not to defend the constitutionality of \xc2\xa73 in court while continuing to deny refunds and to assess deficiencies does introduce a complication.  Even though the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s current position was announced before the District Court entered its judgment, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s position would not have deprived the District Court of jurisdiction to entertain and resolve the refund suit; for her injury (fail- ure to obtain a refund allegedly required by law) was concrete, persisting, and unredressed.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position\xe2\x80\x94agreeing with Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s legal contention but refusing to give it effect\xe2\x80\x94meant that there was a justiciable controversy between the parties, despite what the claimant would find to be an inconsistency in that stance.  Windsor, the Government, BLAG, and the amicus appear to agree upon that point.  The disagreement is over the standing of the parties, or aspiring parties, to take an appeal in the Court of Appeals and to appear as parties in further proceedings in this Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe amicus\xe2\x80\x99 position is that, given the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concession that \xc2\xa73 is unconstitutional, once the District Court ordered the refund the case should have ended; and the amicus argues the Court of Appeals should have dismissed the appeal.  The amicus submits that once the President agreed with Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s legal position and the District Court issued its judgment, the parties were no longer adverse.  From this standpoint the United States was a prevailing party below, just as Windsor was.  Accordingly, the amicus reasons, it is inappropriate for this Court to grant certiorari and proceed to rule on the merits; for the United States seeks no redress from the judgment entered against it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis position, however, elides the distinction between two principles: the jurisdictional requirements of Article III and the prudential limits on its exercise.

The judgment in question orders the United States to pay Windsor the refund she seeks.  An order directing the Treasury to pay money is \xe2\x80\x9ca real and immediate economic injury,\xe2\x80\x9d Hein, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 599, indeed as real and immediate as an order directing an individual to pay a tax.  That the Executive may welcome this order to pay the refund if it is accompanied by the constitutional ruling it wants does not eliminate the injury to the national Treasury if payment is made, or to the taxpayer if it is not.  The judgment orders the United States to pay money that it would not disburse but for the court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  The Government of the United States has a valid legal argument that it is injured even if the Executive disagrees with \xc2\xa73 of DOMA, which results in Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s liability for the tax.  Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing claim for funds that the United States refuses to pay thus establishes a controversy sufficient for Article III jurisdiction.  It would be a different case if the Executive had taken the further step of paying Windsor the refund to which she was entitled under the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis Court confronted a comparable case in INS v. Chadha, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919 (1983)\n.  A statute by its terms allowed one House of Congress to order the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to deport the respondent Chadha.  There, as here, the Executive determined that the statute was unconstitutional, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe INS presented the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s views on the constitutionality of the House action to the Court of Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 930.  The INS, however, continued to abide by the statute, and \xe2\x80\x9cthe INS brief to the Court of Appeals did not alter the agency\xe2\x80\x99s decision to comply with the House action ordering deportation of Chadha.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  This Court held \xe2\x80\x9cthat the INS was sufficiently aggrieved by the Court of Appeals deci- sion prohibiting it from taking action it would otherwise take,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., regardless of whether the agency welcomed the judgment.  The necessity of a \xe2\x80\x9ccase or controversy\xe2\x80\x9d to satisfy Article III was defined as a requirement that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decision will have real meaning: if we rule for Chadha, he will not be deported; if we uphold [the statute], the INS will execute its order and deport him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 939\xe2\x80\x93940 (quoting Chadha v.

The holdings of cases are instructive, and the words of Chadha make clear its holding that the refusal of the Executive to provide the relief sought suffices to preserve a justiciable dispute as required by Article III.  In short, even where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government largely agree[s] with the opposing party on the merits of the controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d there is sufficient adverseness and an \xe2\x80\x9cadequate basis for jurisdiction in the fact that the Government intended to enforce the challenged law against that party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 940, n.\xc2\xa012.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is true that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party who receives all that he has sought generally is not aggrieved by the judgment affording the relief and cannot appeal from it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roper, supra, at 333, see also Camreta v.

Even when Article III permits the exercise of federal jurisdiction, prudential considerations demand that the Court insist upon \xe2\x80\x9cthat concrete adverseness which sharpens the presentation of issues upon which the court so largely depends for illumination of difficult constitutional questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Baker v.

Unlike Article III requirements\xe2\x80\x94which must be satisfied by the parties before judicial consideration is appropriate\xe2\x80\x94the relevant prudential factors that counsel against hearing this case are subject to \xe2\x80\x9ccountervailing considerations [that] may outweigh the concerns underlying the usual reluctance to exert judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Warth, 422 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 500\xe2\x80\x93501.  One consideration is the extent to which adversarial presentation of the issues is assured by the participation of amici curiae prepared to defend with vigor the constitutionality of the legislative act.  With respect to this prudential aspect of standing as well, the Chadha Court encountered a similar situation.  It noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be prudential, as opposed to Art. III, concerns about sanctioning the adjudication of [this case] in the absence of any participant supporting the validity of [the statute].  The Court of Appeals properly dispelled any such concerns by inviting and accepting briefs from both Houses of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 940.  Chadha was not an anomaly in this respect.  The Court adopts the practice of entertaining arguments made by an amicus when the Solicitor General confesses error with respect to a judgment below, even if the confession is in effect an admission that an Act of Congress is unconstitutional.  See, e.g., Dickerson v. United States, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428 (2000)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the case now before the Court the attorneys for BLAG present a substantial argument for the constitutionality of \xc2\xa73 of DOMA.  BLAG\xe2\x80\x99s sharp adversarial presentation of the issues satisfies the prudential concerns that otherwise might counsel against hearing an appeal from a decision with which the principal parties agree.  Were this Court to hold that prudential rules require it to dismiss the case, and, in consequence, that the Court of Appeals erred in failing to dismiss it as well, extensive litigation would ensue.  The district courts in 94 districts throughout the Nation would be without precedential guidance not only in tax refund suits but also in cases involving the whole of DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s sweep involving over 1,000 federal statutes and a myriad of federal regulations.  For instance, the opinion of the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, addressing the validity of DOMA in a case involving regulations of the Department of Health and Human Services, likely would be vacated with instructions to dismiss, its ruling and guidance also then erased.  See Massachusetts v. United States Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F.\xc2\xa03d 1 (CA1 2012).  Rights and privileges of hundreds of thousands of persons would be adversely affected, pending a case in which all prudential concerns about justiciability are absent.  That numerical prediction may not be certain, but it is certain that the cost in judicial resources and expense of litigation for all persons adversely affected would be immense.  True, the very extent of DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s mandate means that at some point a case likely would arise without the prudential concerns raised here; but the costs, uncertainties, and alleged harm and injuries likely would continue for a time measured in years before the issue is resolved.  In these unusual and urgent circumstances, the very term \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d counsels that it is a proper exercise of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to take jurisdiction.  For these reasons, the prudential and Article III requirements are met here; and, as a consequence, the Court need not decide whether BLAG would have standing to challenge the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling and its affirmance in the Court of Appeals on BLAG\xe2\x80\x99s own authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this petition may be heard on the merits does not imply that no difficulties would ensue if this were a common practice in ordinary cases.  The Executive\xe2\x80\x99s failure to defend the constitutionality of an Act of Congress based on a constitutional theory not yet established in judicial decisions has created a procedural dilemma.  On the one hand, as noted, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with Windsor raises questions about the propriety of entertaining a suit in which it seeks affirmance of an order invalidating a federal law and ordering the United States to pay money.  On the other hand, if the Execu- tive\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with a plaintiff that a law is unconsti- tutional is enough to preclude judicial review, then the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s primary role in determining the constitutionality of a law that has inflicted real injury on a plaintiff who has brought a justiciable legal claim would become only secondary to the President\xe2\x80\x99s.  This would undermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers principle that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, \xe2\x80\x98[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 7) (quoting Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803)).  Similarly, with respect to the legislative power, when Congress has passed a statute and a President has signed it, it poses grave challenges to the separation of powers for the Executive at a particular moment to be able to nullify Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment solely on its own initiative and without any determination from the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional holding, it must be underscored, does not mean the arguments for dismissing this dispute on prudential grounds lack substance.  Yet the difficulty the Executive faces should be acknowledged.  When the Executive makes a principled determination that a statute is unconstitutional, it faces a difficult choice.  Still, there is no suggestion here that it is appropriate for the Executive as a matter of course to challenge statutes in the judicial forum rather than making the case to Congress for their amendment or repeal.  The integrity of the political process would be at risk if difficult consti- tutional issues were simply referred to the Court as a routine exercise.  But this case is not routine.  And the capable defense of the law by BLAG ensures that these prudential issues do not cloud the merits question, which is one of immediate importance to the Federal Government and to hundreds of thousands of persons.  These cir- cumstances support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to proceed to the merits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen at first Windsor and Spyer longed to marry, neither New York nor any other State granted them that right.  After waiting some years, in 2007 they traveled to Ontario to be married there.  It seems fair to conclude that, until recent years, many citizens had not even considered the possibility that two persons of the same sex might aspire to occupy the same status and dignity as that of a man and woman in lawful marriage.  For marriage between a man and a woman no doubt had been thought of by most people as essential to the very definition of that term and to its role and function throughout the history of civilization.  That belief, for many who long have held it, became even more urgent, more cherished when challenged.  For others, however, came the beginnings of a new perspective, a new insight.  Accordingly some States concluded that same-sex marriage ought to be given recognition and validity in the law for those same-sex couples who wish to define themselves by their commitment to each other.  The limitation of lawful marriage to heterosexual couples, which for centuries had been deemed both necessary and fundamental, came to be seen in New York and certain other States as an unjust exclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSlowly at first and then in rapid course, the laws of New York came to acknowledge the urgency of this issue for same-sex couples who wanted to affirm their commitment to one another before their children, their family, their friends, and their community.  And so New York recognized same-sex marriages performed elsewhere; and then it later amended its own marriage laws to permit same-sex marriage.  New York, in common with, as of this writing, 11 other States and the District of Columbia, decided that same-sex couples should have the right to marry and so live with pride in themselves and their union and in a status of equality with all other married persons.  After a statewide deliberative process that enabled its citizens to discuss and weigh arguments for and against same- sex marriage, New York acted to enlarge the definition of marriage to correct what its citizens and elected representatives perceived to be an injustice that they had not earlier known or understood.  See Marriage Equality Act, 2011 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Laws 749 (codified at N.\xc2\xa0Y. Dom. Rel. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x93a, 10\xe2\x80\x93b, 13 (West 2013)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgainst this background of lawful same-sex marriage in some States, the design, purpose, and effect of DOMA should be considered as the beginning point in deciding whether it is valid under the Constitution.  By history and tradition the definition and regulation of marriage, as will be discussed in more detail, has been treated as being within the authority and realm of the separate States.  Yet it is further established that Congress, in enacting discrete statutes, can make determinations that bear on marital rights and privileges.  Just this Term the Court upheld the authority of the Congress to pre-empt state laws, allowing a former spouse to retain life insurance proceeds under a federal program that gave her priority, because of formal beneficiary designation rules, over the wife by a second marriage who survived the husband.  Hillman v. Maretta, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013); see also Ridgway v. Ridgway, \n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46 (1981)\n; Wissner v. Wissner, \n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 655 (1950)\n.  This is one example of the general principle that when the Federal Government acts in the exercise of its own proper authority, it has a wide choice of the mechanisms and means to adopt.  See McCulloch v. Maryland, 4 Wheat. 316, 421 (1819).  Congress has the power both to ensure efficiency in the administration of its programs and to choose what larger goals and policies to pursue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOther precedents involving congressional statutes which affect marriages and family status further illustrate this point.  In addressing the interaction of state domestic relations and federal immigration law Congress determined that marriages \xe2\x80\x9centered into for the purpose of procuring an alien\xe2\x80\x99s admission [to the United States] as an immigrant\xe2\x80\x9d will not qualify the noncitizen for that status, even if the noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s marriage is valid and proper for state-law purposes.  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71186a(b)(1) (2006 ed. and Supp. V).  And in establishing income-based criteria for Social Security benefits, Congress decided that although state law would determine in general who qualifies as an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s spouse, common-law marriages also should be recognized, regardless of any particular State\xe2\x80\x99s view on these relationships.  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71382c(d)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThough these discrete examples establish the constitutionality of limited federal laws that regulate the meaning of marriage in order to further federal policy, DOMA has a far greater reach; for it enacts a directive applicable to over 1,000 federal statutes and the whole realm of federal regulations.  And its operation is directed to a class of persons that the laws of New York, and of 11 other States, have sought to protect.  See Goodridge v.

State laws defining and regulating marriage, of course, must respect the constitutional rights of persons, see, e.g., Loving v. Virginia, \n\n388 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1967)\n; but, subject to those guarantees, \xe2\x80\x9cregulation of domestic relations\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9can area that has long been regarded as a virtually exclusive province of the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sosna v. Iowa, \n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393, \n404 (1975)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe recognition of civil marriages is central to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens.  See Williams v. North Carolina, \n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 287, \n298 (1942)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cEach state as a sovereign has a rightful and legitimate concern in the marital status of persons domiciled within its borders\xe2\x80\x9d).  The definition of marriage is the foundation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s broader authority to regulate the subject of domestic relations with respect to the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he states, at the time of the adoption of the Constitution, possessed full power over the subject of marriage and divorce .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0[and] the Constitution delegated no authority to the Government of the United States on the subject of marriage and divorce.\xe2\x80\x9d  Haddock v. Haddock, \n\n201 U.\xc2\xa0S. 562, \n575 (1906)\n; see also In re Burrus, \n\n136 U.\xc2\xa0S. 586\n\xe2\x80\x93594 (1890) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe whole subject of the domestic relations of husband and wife, parent and child, belongs to the laws of the States and not to the laws of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with this allocation of authority, the Federal Government, through our history, has deferred to state-law policy decisions with respect to domestic relations.  In De Sylva v. Ballentine, \n\n351 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570 (1956)\n, for example, the Court held that, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o decide who is the widow or widower of a deceased author, or who are his executors or next of kin,\xe2\x80\x9d under the Copyright Act \xe2\x80\x9crequires a reference to the law of the State which created those legal relationships\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no federal law of domestic relations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 580.  In order to respect this principle, the federal courts, as a general rule, do not adjudicate issues of marital status even when there might otherwise be a basis for federal jurisdiction.  See Ankenbrandt v. Richards, \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 689, \n703 (1992)\n.  Federal courts will not hear divorce and custody cases even if they arise in diversity because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe virtually exclusive primacy .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the States in the regulation of domestic relations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 714 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe significance of state responsibilities for the definition and regulation of marriage dates to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s beginning; for \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the Constitution was adopted the common understanding was that the domestic relations of husband and wife and parent and child were matters reserved to the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio ex\xc2\xa0rel. Popovici v. Agler, \n\n280 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379\n\xe2\x80\x93384 (1930).  Marriage laws vary in some respects from State to State.  For example, the required minimum age is 16 in Vermont, but only 13 in New Hampshire.  Compare Vt. Stat. Ann., Tit. 18, \xc2\xa75142 (2012), with N.\xc2\xa0H. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7457:4 (West Supp. 2012).  Likewise the permissible degree of consanguinity can vary (most States permit first cousins to marry, but a handful\xe2\x80\x94such as Iowa and Washington, see Iowa Code \xc2\xa7595.19 (2009); Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa726.04.020 (2012)\xe2\x80\x94prohibit the practice).  But these rules are in every event consistent within each State.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAgainst this background DOMA rejects the long-established precept that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married couples within each State, though they may vary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State to the next.  Despite these considerations, it is unnecessary to decide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a violation of the Constitution because it disrupts the federal balance.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s power in defining the marital relation is of central relevance in this case quite apart from principles of federalism.  Here the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.  When the State used its historic and essential authority to define the marital relation in this way, its role and its power in making the decision enhanced the recognition, dignity, and protection of the class in their own community.  DOMA, because of its reach and extent, departs from this history and tra- dition of reliance on state law to define marriage.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[D]is-criminations of an unusual character especially sug- gest careful consideration to determine whether they are obnoxious to the constitutional provision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Romer v.

That result requires this Court now to address whether the resulting injury and indignity is a deprivation of an essential part of the liberty protected by the \n \nFifth Amendment.  What the State of New York treats as alike the federal law deems unlike by a law designed to injure the same class the State seeks to protect.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn acting first to recognize and then to allow same-sex marriages, New York was responding \xe2\x80\x9cto the initiative of those who [sought] a voice in shaping the destiny of their own times.\xe2\x80\x9d Bond v. United States, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 9).  These actions were without doubt a proper exercise of its sovereign authority within our fed- eral system, all in the way that the Framers of the Constitu-tion intended.  The dynamics of state government in the federal system are to allow the formation of consensus respecting the way the members of a discrete community treat each other in their daily contact and constant interaction with each other.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe States\xe2\x80\x99 interest in defining and regulating the marital relation, subject to constitutional guarantees, stems from the understanding that marriage is more than a routine classification for purposes of certain statutory benefits.  Private, consensual sexual intimacy between two adult persons of the same sex may not be punished by the State, and it can form \xe2\x80\x9cbut one element in a personal bond that is more enduring.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawrence v. Texas, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558, \n567 (2003)\n.  By its recognition of the validity of same-sex marriages performed in other jurisdictions and then by authorizing same-sex unions and same-sex marriages, New York sought to give further protection and dignity to that bond.  For same-sex couples who wished to be married, the State acted to give their lawful conduct a lawful status.  This status is a far-reaching legal acknowledgment of the intimate relationship between two people, a relationship deemed by the State worthy of dignity in the community equal with all other marriages.  It reflects both the community\xe2\x80\x99s considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving understanding of the meaning of equality.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA seeks to injure the very class New York seeks to protect.  By doing so it violates basic due process and equal protection principles applicable to the Federal Government.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 5; Bolling v. Sharpe, \n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497 (1954)\n.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of equality \xe2\x80\x9cmust at the very least mean that a bare con- gressional desire to harm a politically unpopular group cannot\xe2\x80\x9d justify disparate treatment of that group.

Supra, at 19 (quoting Romer, supra, at 633).  DOMA cannot survive under these principles.  The responsibility of the States for the regulation of domestic relations is an important indicator of the substantial societal impact the State\xe2\x80\x99s classifications have in the daily lives and customs of its people.  DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s unusual deviation from the usual tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage here operates to deprive same-sex couples of the benefits and responsibilities that come with the federal recognition of their marriages.  This is strong evidence of a law having the purpose and effect of disapproval of that class.  The avowed purpose and practical effect of the law here in question are to impose a disadvantage, a separate status, and so a stigma upon all who enter into same-sex marriages made lawful by the unquestioned authority of the States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe history of DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and its own text demonstrate that interference with the equal dignity of same-sex marriages, a dignity conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power, was more than an incidental effect of the federal statute.  It was its essence.  The House Report announced its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cit is both appropriate and necessary for Congress to do what it can to defend the institution of traditional heterosexual marriage. .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. H.\xc2\xa0R. 3396 is appropriately entitled the \xe2\x80\x98Defense of Marriage Act.\xe2\x80\x99  The effort to redefine \xe2\x80\x98marriage\xe2\x80\x99 to extend to homosexual couples is a truly radical proposal that would fundamentally alter the institution of marriage.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93664, pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (1996).  The House concluded that DOMA expresses \xe2\x80\x9cboth moral disapproval of homosexuality, and a moral conviction that heterosexuality better comports with traditional (especially Judeo-Christian) morality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 16 (footnote deleted).  The stated purpose of the law was to promote an \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in protecting the traditional moral teachings reflected in heterosexual-only marriage laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Were there any doubt of this far-reaching purpose, the title of the Act confirms it: The Defense of Marriage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe arguments put forward by BLAG are just as candid about the congressional purpose to influence or interfere with state sovereign choices about who may be married.  As the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its purpose is to discourage enactment of state same-sex marriage laws and to restrict the freedom and choice of couples married under those laws if they are enacted.  The congressional goal was \xe2\x80\x9cto put a thumb on the scales and influence a state\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to how to shape its own marriage laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Massachusetts, 682 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s demonstrated purpose is to ensure that if any State decides to recognize same-sex marriages, those unions will be treated as second-class marriages for purposes of federal law.  This raises a most serious question under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nFifth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA\xe2\x80\x99s operation in practice confirms this purpose.  When New York adopted a law to permit same-sex marriage, it sought to eliminate inequality; but DOMA frustrates that objective through a system-wide enactment with no identified connection to any particular area of fed- eral law.  DOMA writes inequality into the entire United States Code.  The particular case at hand concerns the estate tax, but DOMA is more than a simple determi- nation of what should or should not be allowed as an estate tax refund.  Among the over 1,000 statutes and numerous federal regulations that DOMA controls are laws pertaining to Social Security, housing, taxes, criminal sanctions, copyright, and veterans\xe2\x80\x99 benefits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDOMA\xe2\x80\x99s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages and make them unequal.  The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like governmental efficiency.  Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.  And DOMA contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.  By creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, DOMA forces same-sex couples to live as married for the purpose of state law but unmarried for the purpose of federal law, thus diminishing the stability and predictability of basic personal relations the State has found it proper to acknowledge and protect.  By this dynamic DOMA undermines both the public and private significance of state-sanctioned same-sex marriages; for it tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy of federal recognition.  This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage.  The differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see Lawrence, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558\n, and whose relationship the State has sought to dignify.  And it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.  The law in question makes it even more difficult for the children to understand the integrity and closeness of their own family and its concord with other families in their community and in their daily lives.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder DOMA, same-sex married couples have their lives burdened, by reason of government decree, in visible and public ways.  By its great reach, DOMA touches many aspects of married and family life, from the mundane to the profound.  It prevents same-sex married couples from obtaining government healthcare benefits they would otherwise receive.  See 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78901(5), 8905.

See \n\n20 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71087nn(b).  Same-sex married couples are exempt from this requirement.  The same is true with respect to federal ethics rules.

DOMA singles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty.  It imposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and proper.  DOMA instructs all federal officials, and indeed all persons with whom same-sex couples interact, including their own children, that their marriage is less worthy than the marriages of others.  The federal statute is invalid, for no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the State, by its marriage laws, sought to protect in personhood and dignity.  By seeking to displace this protection and treating those persons as living in marriages less respected than others, the federal statute is in violation of the \n \nFifth Amendment.

Standing in the way is an obstacle, a technicality of little interest to anyone but the people of We the People, who created it as a barrier against judges\xe2\x80\x99 intrusion into their lives.

The Court says that we have the power to decide this case because if we did not, then our \xe2\x80\x9cprimary role in determining the constitutionality of a law\xe2\x80\x9d (at least one that \xe2\x80\x9chas inflicted real injury on a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x9d) would \xe2\x80\x9cbecome only secondary to the President\xe2\x80\x99s.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  But wait, the reader wonders\xe2\x80\x94Windsor won below, and so cured her injury, and the President was glad to see it.  True, says the majority, but judicial review must march on regardless, lest we \xe2\x80\x9cundermine the clear dictate of the separation-of-powers principle that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

It is an assertion of judicial supremacy over the people\xe2\x80\x99s Representatives in Congress and the Executive.  It envisions a Supreme Court standing (or rather enthroned) at the apex of government, empowered to decide all constitutional questions, always and every- where \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d in its role.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis image of the Court would have been unrecognizable to those who wrote and ratified our national charter.

We can do so only when that allegation will determine the outcome of a lawsuit, and is contradicted by the other party.  The \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d is not, as the major- ity believes, the power \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to say what the law is,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., giving the Supreme Court the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary role in determining the constitutionality of laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority must have in mind one of the foreign constitutions that pronounces such primacy for its constitutional court and allows that primacy to be exercised in contexts other than a lawsuit.  See, e.g., Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany, Art. 93.  The judicial power as Americans have understood it (and their English ancestors before them) is the power to adjudicate, with conclusive effect, disputed govern- ment claims (civil or criminal) against private persons, and disputed claims by private persons against the government or other private persons.  Sometimes (though not always) the parties before the court disagree not with regard to the facts of their case (or not only with regard to the facts) but with regard to the applicable law\xe2\x80\x94in which event (and only in which event) it becomes the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn other words, declaring the compatibility of state or federal laws with the Constitution is not only not the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary role\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court, it is not a separate, free-standing role at all.  We perform that role incidentally\xe2\x80\x94by accident, as it were\xe2\x80\x94when that is necessary to resolve the dispute before us.  Then, and only then, does it become \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  That is why, in 1793, we politely declined the Washington Administration\xe2\x80\x99s request to \xe2\x80\x9csay what the law is\xe2\x80\x9d on a particular treaty matter that was not the subject of a concrete legal controversy.  3 Correspondence and Public Papers of John Jay 486\xe2\x80\x93489 (H. Johnston ed. 1893).  And that is why, as our opinions have said, some questions of law will never be presented to this Court, because there will never be anyone with standing to bring a lawsuit.  See Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, \n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 208, \n227 (1974)\n; United States v. Richardson, \n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 166, \n179 (1974)\n.  As Justice Bran- deis put it, we cannot \xe2\x80\x9cpass upon the constitutionality of legislation in a friendly, non-adversary, proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d; absent a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98real, earnest and vital controversy between individuals,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we have neither any work to do nor any power to do it.

Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s injury was cured by the judgment in her favor.  And while, in ordinary circumstances, the United States is injured by a directive to pay a tax refund, this suit is far from ordinary.  Whatever injury the United States has suffered will surely not be redressed by the action that it, as a litigant, asks us to take.  The final sentence of the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s brief on the merits reads:  \xe2\x80\x9cFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States (merits) 54 (emphasis added).  That will not cure the Government\xe2\x80\x99s injury, but carve it into stone.  One could spend many fruitless afternoons ransacking our library for any other petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s brief seeking an affirmance of the judgment against it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  What the petitioner United States asks us to do in the case before us is exactly what the respondent Windsor asks us to do: not to provide relief from the judgment below but to say that that judgment was correct.  And the same was true in the Court of Appeals: Neither party sought to undo the judgment for Windsor, and so that court should have dismissed the appeal (just as we should dismiss) for lack of jurisdiction.  Since both parties agreed with the judgment of the District Court for the Southern District of New York, the suit should have ended there.  The further proceedings have been a contrivance, having no object in mind except to ele- vate a District Court judgment that has no precedential effect in other courts, to one that has precedential effect throughout the Second Circuit, and then (in this Court) precedential effect throughout the United States.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have never before agreed to speak\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9csay what the law is\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94where there is no controversy before us.  In the more than two centuries that this Court has existed as an institution, we have never suggested that we have the power to decide a question when every party agrees with both its nominal opponent and the court below on that question\xe2\x80\x99s answer.  The United States reluctantly con- ceded that at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe closest we have ever come to what the Court blesses today was our opinion in INS v. Chadha, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919 (1983)\n.  But in that case, two parties to the litigation  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t disagreed with the position of the United States and with the court below: the House and Senate, which had intervened in the case.  Because Chadha concerned the validity of a mode of congressional action\xe2\x80\x94the one-house legis- lative veto\xe2\x80\x94the House and Senate were threatened with destruction of what they claimed to be one of their institutional powers.  The Executive choosing not to defend that power,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t we permitted the House and Senate to intervene.  Nothing like that is present here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, the Court in Chadha said that statutory aggrieved-party status was \xe2\x80\x9cnot altered by the fact that the Executive may agree with the holding that the statute in question is unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 930\xe2\x80\x93931.  But in a footnote to that statement, the Court acknowledged Arti- cle III\xe2\x80\x99s separate requirement of a \xe2\x80\x9cjusticiable case or controversy,\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that this requirement was satisfied \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the presence of the two Houses of Congress as adverse parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 931, n.\xc2\xa06.  Later in its opinion, the Chadha Court remarked that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 announced intention to enforce the statute also sufficed to permit judicial review, even absent congressional participation.  Id., at 939.  That remark is true, as a description of the judicial review conducted in the Court of Appeals, where the Houses of Congress had not inter-  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tvened.  (The case originated in the Court of Appeals, since it sought review of agency action under \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71105a(a) (1976 ed.).)  There, absent a judgment setting aside the INS order, Chadha faced deportation.  This pas- sage of our opinion seems to be addressing that initial standing in the Court of Appeals, as indicated by its quotation from the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 939\xe2\x80\x93940.  But if it was addressing standing to pursue the appeal, the remark was both the purest dictum (as congressional intervention at that point made the required adverseness \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 939), and quite incorrect.  When a private party has a judicial decree safely in hand to prevent his injury, additional judicial action requires that a party injured by the decree seek to undo it.  In Chadha, the intervening House and Senate fulfilled that requirement.  Here no one does.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the requirements of Article III bears no resemblance to our jurisprudence.  It accuses the amicus (appointed to argue against our jurisdiction) of \xe2\x80\x9celid[ing] the distinction between .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the jurisdictional requirements of Article III and the prudential limits on its exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6.  It then proceeds to call the requirement of adverseness a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of standing.  Of standing.  That is incomprehensible.  A plaintiff (or appellant) can have all the standing in the world\xe2\x80\x94satisfying all three standing requirements of Lujan that the majority so carefully quotes, ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x94and yet no Article III controversy may be before the court.  Article III requires not just a plaintiff (or appellant) who has standing to complain but an opposing party who denies the validity of the complaint.  It is not the amicus that has done the eliding of distinctions, but the majority, calling the quite separate Article III requirement of adverseness between the parties an element (which it then pronounces a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d element) of standing.  The question here is not whether, as the majority puts it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States retains a stake sufficient to support Article III jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid. the question is whether there is any controversy (which requires contradiction) between the United States and Ms. Windsor.  There is not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI find it wryly amusing that the majority seeks to dismiss the requirement of party-adverseness as nothing more than a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d aspect of the sole Article III requirement of standing.  (Relegating a jurisdictional re- quirement to \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d status is a wondrous device, enabling courts to ignore the requirement whenever they believe it \xe2\x80\x9cprudent\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, a good idea.)  Half a century ago, a Court similarly bent upon announcing its view regarding the constitutionality of a federal statute achieved that goal by effecting a remarkably similar but completely opposite distortion of the principles limiting our jurisdiction.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s notorious opinion in Flast v. Cohen, \n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n\xe2\x80\x93101 (1968), held that standing was merely an element (which it pronounced to be a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d element) of the sole Article III requirement of adverseness.  We have been living with the chaos created by that power-grabbing decision ever since, see Hein v. Freedom From Religion Foundation, Inc., \n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 587 (2007)\n, as we will have to live with the chaos created by this one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe authorities the majority cites fall miles short of supporting the counterintuitive notion that an Article III \xe2\x80\x9ccontroversy\xe2\x80\x9d can exist without disagreement between the parties.  In Deposit Guaranty Nat. Bank v. Roper, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326 (1980)\n, the District Court had entered judgment in the individual plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s favor based on the defendant bank\xe2\x80\x99s offer to pay the full amount claimed.  The plaintiff, however, sought to appeal the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of class certification under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23.  There was a continuing dispute between the parties concerning the issue raised on appeal.  The same is true of the other case cited by the majority, Camreta v. Greene, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  There the District Court found that the defendant state officers had violated the \n \nFourth Amendment, but rendered judgment in their favor because they were entitled to official immunity, application of the \n \nFourth Amendment to their conduct not having been clear at the time of violation.  The officers sought to appeal the holding of \n \nFourth Amendment violation, which would circumscribe their future conduct; the plaintiff continued to insist that a \n \nFourth Amendment violation had occurred.  The \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d discretion to which both those cases refer was the discretion to deny an appeal even when a live controversy exists\xe2\x80\x94not the discretion to grant one when it does not.  The majority can cite no case in which this Court entertained an appeal in which both parties urged us to affirm the judgment below.  And that is because the existence of a controversy is not a \xe2\x80\x9cprudential\xe2\x80\x9d requirement that we have invented, but an essential element of an Article III case or controversy.

That is as it should be, when both the President and the plaintiff agree that the statute is unconstitutional.  Where the Executive is en- forcing an unconstitutional law, suit will of course lie; but if, in that suit, the Executive admits the unconstitution- ality of the law, the litigation should end in an order or a consent decree enjoining enforcement.  This suit saw the light of day only because the President enforced the Act (and thus gave Windsor standing to sue) even though he believed it unconstitutional.  He could have equally chosen (more appropriately, some would say) neither to enforce nor to defend the statute he believed to be unconstitu- tional, see Presidential Authority to Decline to Execute Un- constitutional Statutes, 18 Op. Off. Legal Counsel 199 (Nov. 2, 1994)\xe2\x80\x94in which event Windsor would not have been injured, the District Court could not have refereed this friendly scrimmage, and the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s determination of unconstitutionality would have escaped this Court\xe2\x80\x99s desire to blurt out its view of the law.  The matter would have been left, as so many matters ought to be left, to a tug of war between the President and the Congress, which has innumerable means (up to and including impeachment) of compelling the President to enforce the laws it has written.  Or the President could have evaded presentation of the constitutional issue to this Court simply by declining to appeal the District Court and Court of Appeals dispositions he agreed with.  Be sure of this much: If a President wants to insulate his judgment of unconstitutionality from our review, he can.  What the views urged in this dissent produce is not insulation from judicial review but insulation from Executive contrivance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority brandishes the famous sentence from Marbury v.

But that sentence neither says nor implies that it is always the province and duty of the Court to say what the law is\xe2\x80\x94much less that its responsibility in that regard is a \xe2\x80\x9cprimary\xe2\x80\x9d one.  The very next sentence of Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s opinion makes the crucial qualification that today\xe2\x80\x99s majority ignores: \xe2\x80\x9cThose who apply the rule to particular cases, must of necessity expound and interpret that rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  1\xc2\xa0Cranch, at 177 (emphasis added).

For the views of our early Court more precisely addressing the question before us here, the ma- jority ought instead to have consulted the opinion of Chief Justice Taney in Lord v.

That would be replaced by a system in which Congress and the Executive can pop immediately into court, in their institutional capacity, whenever the President refuses to implement a statute he believes to be unconstitutional, and whenever he implements a law in a manner that is not to Congress\xe2\x80\x99s liking.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s notion of standing will likewise enormously shrink the area to which \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial censure, exercised by the courts on legislation, cannot extend,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.  For example, a bare majority of both Houses could bring into court the assertion that the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s implementation of welfare programs is too generous\xe2\x80\x94a failure that no other litigant would have standing to complain about.  Moreover, as we indicated in Raines v. Byrd, \n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 811, \n828 (1997)\n, if Congress can sue the Executive for the erroneous application of the law that \xe2\x80\x9cinjures\xe2\x80\x9d its power to legislate, surely the Executive can sue Congress for its erroneous adoption of an unconstitutional law that \xe2\x80\x9cinjures\xe2\x80\x9d the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s power to administer\xe2\x80\x94or perhaps for its protracted failure to act on one of his nominations.  The opportunities for dragging the courts into disputes hith- erto left for political resolution are endless.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s dissent is correct that Raines did not formally decide this issue, but its reasoning does.  The opinion spends three pages discussing famous, decades-long disputes between the President and Congress\xe2\x80\x94regarding congressional power to forbid the Presidential removal of executive officers, regarding the legislative veto, regarding congressional appointment of executive officers, and regarding the pocket veto\xe2\x80\x94that would surely have been promptly resolved by a Congress-vs.-the-President lawsuit if the impairment of a branch\xe2\x80\x99s powers alone conferred standing to commence litigation.  But it does not, and never has; the \xe2\x80\x9cenormous power that the judiciary would acquire\xe2\x80\x9d from the ability to adjudicate such suits \xe2\x80\x9cwould have made a mockery of [Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s] quotation of Montesquieu to the effect that \xe2\x80\x98of the three powers above mentioned .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the JUDICIARY is next to nothing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Barnes v.

Unimaginable evil this is not.  Our system is designed for confrontation.  That is what \xe2\x80\x9c[a]mbition .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. counteract[ing] ambition,\xe2\x80\x9d The Federalist, No. 51, at 322 (J. Madison), is all about.  If majorities in both Houses of Congress care enough about the matter, they have available innumerable ways to com- pel executive action without a lawsuit\xe2\x80\x94from refusing to confirm Presidential appointees to the elimination of funding.  (Nothing says \xe2\x80\x9cenforce the Act\xe2\x80\x9d quite like \xe2\x80\x9c.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or you will have money for little else.\xe2\x80\x9d)  But the condition is crucial; Congress must care enough to act against the President itself, not merely enough to instruct its lawyers to ask us to do so.  Placing the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s entirely anticipated political arm wrestling into permanent judicial receivership does not do the system a favor.  And by the way, if the President loses the lawsuit but does not faithfully implement the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decree, just as he did not faithfully implement Congress\xe2\x80\x99s statute, what then?  Only Congress can bring him to heel by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. what do you think?  Yes: a direct confrontation with the President.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the reasons above, I think that this Court has, and the Court of Appeals had, no power to decide this suit.  We should vacate the decision below and remand to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, with instructions to dismiss the appeal.  Given that the majority has volunteered its view of the merits, however, I proceed to discuss that as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are many remarkable things about the majority\xe2\x80\x99s merits holding.  The first is how rootless and shifting its justifications are.  For example, the opinion starts with seven full pages about the traditional power of States to define domestic relations\xe2\x80\x94initially fooling many readers, I am sure, into thinking that this is a federalism opinion.  But we are eventually told that \xe2\x80\x9cit is unnecessary to decide whether this federal intrusion on state power is a vio- lation of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State\xe2\x80\x99s power in defining the marital relation is of central relevance in this case quite apart from principles of federalism\xe2\x80\x9d be- cause \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give this class of persons the right to marry conferred upon them a dignity and status of immense import.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  But no one questions the power of the States to define marriage (with the concomitant conferral of dignity and status), so what is the point of devoting seven pages to describing how long and well established that power is?  Even after the opinion has formally disclaimed reliance upon principles of federalism, mentions of \xe2\x80\x9cthe usual tradition of recognizing and accepting state definitions of marriage\xe2\x80\x9d continue.  See, e.g., ante, at 20.  What to make of this?  The opinion never explains.  My guess is that the majority, while reluctant to suggest that defining the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cmarriage\xe2\x80\x9d in federal statutes is unsupported by any of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated powers,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t nonetheless needs some rhetorical basis to support its pretense that today\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\tlaws excluding same-sex marriage is confined to the Federal Government (leaving the second, state-law shoe to be dropped later, maybe next Term).  But I am only guessing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEqually perplexing are the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s references to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of equality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Near the end of the opinion, we are told that although the \xe2\x80\x9cequal protection guarantee of the \n \nFourteenth Amendment makes [the] \n \nFifth Amendment [due process] right all the more specific and all the better understood and preserved\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94what can that mean?\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe \n \nFifth Amendment itself withdraws from Government the power to degrade or demean in the way this law does.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 25.  The only possible interpretation of this statement is that the Equal Protection Clause, even the Equal Protection Clause as incorporated in the Due Process Clause, is not the basis for today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  But the portion of the majority opinion that explains why DOMA is unconstitutional (Part IV) begins by citing Bolling v. Sharpe, \n\n347 U.\xc2\xa0S. 497 (1954)\n, Department of Agriculture v. Moreno, \n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528 (1973)\n, and Romer v. Evans, \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 620 (1996)\n\xe2\x80\x94all of which are equal-protection cases.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And those three cases are the only authorities that the Court cites in Part IV about the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, except for its citation of Lawrence v. Texas, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558 (2003)\n (not an equal-protection case) to support its passing assertion that the Constitution protects the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral and sexual choices\xe2\x80\x9d of same-sex couples, ante, at 23.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, if this is meant to be an equal-protection opinion, it is a confusing one.  The opinion does not resolve and indeed does not even mention what had been the  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tcentral question in this litigation: whether, under the Equal Protection Clause, laws restricting marriage to a man and a woman are reviewed for more than mere rationality.  That is the issue that divided the parties and the court below, compare Brief for Respondent Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of U.\xc2\xa0S. House of Representatives (merits) 24\xe2\x80\x9328 (no), with Brief for Respondent Windsor (merits) 17\xe2\x80\x9331 and Brief for United States (merits) 18\xe2\x80\x9336 (yes); and compare 699 F.\xc2\xa03d 169, 180\xe2\x80\x93185 (CA2 2012) (yes), with id., at 208\xe2\x80\x93211 (Straub, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part) (no).  In accord with my previously expressed skepticism about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctiers of scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d approach, I would review this classification only for its rationality.  See United States v. Virginia, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515\n\xe2\x80\x93570 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  As nearly as I can tell, the Court agrees with that; its opinion does not apply strict scrutiny, and its central propositions are taken from rational-basis cases like Moreno.  But the Court certainly does not apply anything that resembles that deferential framework.  See Heller v. Doe, \n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312, \n320 (1993)\n (a classification \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must be upheld .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if there is any reason- ably conceivable state of facts\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that could justify it).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority opinion need not get into the strict-vs.-rational-basis scrutiny question, and need not justify its holding under either, because it says that DOMA is unconstitutional as \xe2\x80\x9ca deprivation of the liberty of the person protected by the \n \nFifth Amendment of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 25; that it violates \xe2\x80\x9cbasic due process\xe2\x80\x9d principles, ante, at 20; and that it inflicts an \xe2\x80\x9cinjury and indignity\xe2\x80\x9d of a kind that denies \xe2\x80\x9can essential part of the liberty pro- tected by the \n \nFifth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 19.  The majority never utters the dread words \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive due process,\xe2\x80\x9d perhaps sensing the disrepute into which that doctrine has fallen, but that is what those statements mean.  Yet the opinion does not argue that same-sex marriage is \xe2\x80\x9cdeeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d Washington v. Glucksberg, \n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 702\n\xe2\x80\x93721 (1997), a claim that would of course be quite absurd.  So would the further suggestion (also necessary, under our substantive-due-process precedents) that a world in which DOMA exists is one bereft of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 721 (quoting Palko v.

But that would be wrong; it is already overcooked.  The most expert care in preparation cannot redeem a bad recipe.  The sum of all the Court\xe2\x80\x99s nonspecific hand-waving is that this law is invalid (maybe on equal-protection grounds, maybe on substantive-due-process grounds, and perhaps with some amorphous federalism component playing a role) because it is motivated by a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bare .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. desire to harm\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d couples in same-sex marriages.

See Lawrence v. Texas, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558, \n599 (2003)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  I will not swell the U.\xc2\xa0S. Reports with restatements of that point.  It is enough to say that the Constitution neither requires nor forbids our society to approve of same-sex marriage, much as it neither requires nor forbids us to approve of no-fault divorce, polygamy, or the consumption of alcohol.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHowever, even setting aside traditional moral disapproval of same-sex marriage (or indeed same-sex sex),  there are many perfectly valid\xe2\x80\x94indeed, downright boring\xe2\x80\x94justifying rationales for this legislation.  Their existence ought to be the end of this case.  For they give the lie to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that only those with hateful hearts could have voted \xe2\x80\x9caye\xe2\x80\x9d on this Act.  And more importantly, they serve to make the contents of the legislators\xe2\x80\x99 hearts quite irrelevant:  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a familiar principle of constitutional law that this Court will not strike down an otherwise constitutional statute on the basis of an alleged illicit legislative motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, \n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367, \n383 (1968)\n.  Or at least it was a familiar principle.  By holding to the contrary, the majority has declared open season on any law that (in the opinion of the law\xe2\x80\x99s opponents and any panel of like-minded federal judges) can be characterized as mean-spirited.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority concludes that the only motive for this Act was the \xe2\x80\x9cbare .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. desire to harm a politically unpopular group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 20.  Bear in mind that the object of this condemnation is not the legislature of some once-Confederate Southern state (familiar objects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s scorn, see, e.g., Edwards v. Aguillard, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 578 (1987)\n), but our respected coordinate branches, the Congress and Presidency of the United States.  Laying such a charge against them should require the most extraordinary evidence, and I would have thought that every attempt would be made to indulge a more anodyne explanation for the statute.  The majority does the opposite\xe2\x80\x94affirmatively concealing from the reader the arguments that exist in justification.  It makes only a passing mention of the \xe2\x80\x9carguments put forward\xe2\x80\x9d by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s defenders, and does not even trouble to paraphrase or describe them.  See ante, at 21.

Code \xc2\xa730\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x9319(e) (2011).  When the couple files their next federal tax return, may it be a joint one?  Which State\xe2\x80\x99s law controls, for federal-law purposes: their State of celebration (which recognizes the marriage) or their State of domicile (which does not)?  (Does the answer depend on whether they were just visiting in Albany?)  Are these questions to be answered as a matter of federal common law, or perhaps by borrowing a State\xe2\x80\x99s choice-of-law rules?  If so, which State\xe2\x80\x99s?  And what about States where the status of an out-of-state same-sex marriage is an unsettled question under local law?  See Godfrey v. Spano, 13 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 358, 920 N. E. 2d 328 (2009).  DOMA avoided all of this uncertainty by speci- fying which marriages would be recognized for federal purposes.  That is a classic purpose for a definitional provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, DOMA preserves the intended effects of prior legislation against then-unforeseen changes in circumstance.  When Congress provided (for example) that a special estate-tax exemption would exist for spouses, this exemption reached only opposite-sex spouses\xe2\x80\x94those being the only sort that were recognized in any State at the time of DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  When it became clear that changes in state law might one day alter that balance, DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s definitional section was enacted to ensure that state-level experimentation did not automatically alter the basic operation of federal law, unless and until Congress made the further judgment to do so on its own.  That is not animus\xe2\x80\x94just stabilizing prudence.  Congress has hardly demonstrated itself unwilling to make such further, revising judgments upon due deliberation.  See, e.g., Don\xe2\x80\x99t Ask, Don\xe2\x80\x99t Tell Repeal Act of 2010, \n\n124Stat.\n3515.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court mentions none of this.  Instead, it accuses the Congress that enacted this law and the President who signed it of something much worse than, for example, having acted in excess of enumerated federal powers\xe2\x80\x94or even having drawn distinctions that prove to be irrational.  Those legal errors may be made in good faith, errors though they are.  But the majority says that the supporters of this Act acted with malice\xe2\x80\x94with the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d (ante, at 25) \xe2\x80\x9cto disparage and to injure\xe2\x80\x9d same-sex couples.

To be sure (as the majority points out), the legislation is called the Defense of Marriage Act.  But to defend traditional marriage is not to condemn, demean, or humiliate those who would prefer other arrangements, any more than to defend the Constitution of the United States is to condemn, demean, or humiliate other constitutions.  To hurl such accusations so casually demeans this institution.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, any resistance to its holding is beyond the pale of reasoned disagreement. To question its high-handed invalidation of a presumptively valid statute is to act (the majority is sure) with the purpose to \xe2\x80\x9cdis- parage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9dinjure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdegrade,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ddemean,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chumiliate\xe2\x80\x9d our fellow human beings, our fellow citizens, who are homosexual.  All that, simply for supporting an Act that did no more than codify an aspect of marriage that had been unquestioned in our society for most of its existence\xe2\x80\x94indeed, had been unquestioned in virtually all societies for virtually all of human history.  It is one thing for a society to elect change; it is another for a court of law to impose change by adjudging those who oppose it hostes humani generis, enemies of the human race.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe penultimate sentence of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is a naked declaration that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his opinion and its holding are confined\xe2\x80\x9d to those couples \xe2\x80\x9cjoined in same-sex marriages made lawful by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 26, 25.  I have heard such \xe2\x80\x9cbald, unreasoned disclaimer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d before.  Lawrence, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 604.  When the Court declared a constitutional right to homosexual sodomy, we were assured that the case had nothing, nothing at all to do with \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the government must give formal recognition to any relationship that homosexual persons seek to enter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 578.

It takes real cheek for today\xe2\x80\x99s majority to assure us, as it is going out the door, that a constitutional requirement to give formal recognition to same-sex marriage is not at issue here\xe2\x80\x94when what has preceded that assurance is a lecture on how superior the majority\xe2\x80\x99s moral judgment in favor of same-sex marriage is to the Congress\xe2\x80\x99s hateful moral judgment against it.  I promise you this: The only thing that will \xe2\x80\x9cconfine\xe2\x80\x9d the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is its sense of what it can get away with.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI do not mean to suggest disagreement with The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s view, ante, p.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion), that lower federal courts and state courts can distinguish today\xe2\x80\x99s case when the issue before them is state denial of marital status to same-sex couples\xe2\x80\x94or even that this Court could theoretically do so.  Lord, an opinion with such scatter-shot rationales as this one (federalism noises among them) can be distinguished in many ways.  And deserves to be.

As I have said, the real rationale of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, whatever disappearing trail of its legalistic argle-bargle one chooses to follow, is that DOMA is motivated by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bare .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. desire to harm\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d couples in same-sex marriages.  Supra, at 18.  How easy it is, indeed how inevitable, to reach the same conclusion with regard to state laws denying same-sex couples marital status.  Consider how easy (inevitable) it is to make the following substitutions in a passage from today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion ante, at 22:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cDOMA\xe2\x80\x99s This state law\xe2\x80\x99s principal effect is to identify a subset of state-sanctioned marriages constitution- ally protected sexual relationships, see Lawrence, and make them unequal.  The principal purpose is to impose inequality, not for other reasons like govern- mental efficiency.  Responsibilities, as well as rights, enhance the dignity and integrity of the person.  And DOMA this state law contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State enjoying constitutionally protected sexual relationships, but not other couples, of both rights and responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tOr try this passage, from ante, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[DOMA] This state law tells those couples, and all the world, that their otherwise valid marriages relationships are unworthy of federal state recognition.  This places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage relationship.  The differentiation demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, see Lawrence, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tOr this, from ante, at 23\xe2\x80\x94which does not even require alteration, except as to the invented number:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it humiliates tens of thousands of children now being raised by same-sex couples.

In sum, that Court which finds it so horrific that Congress irrationally and hatefully robbed same-sex couples of the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood and dignity\xe2\x80\x9d which state legislatures conferred upon them, will of a certitude be similarly appalled by state legislatures\xe2\x80\x99 irrational and hateful failure to acknowledge that \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood and dig- nity\xe2\x80\x9d in the first place.

Henceforth those challengers will lead with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno legitimate purpose\xe2\x80\x9d served by such a law, and will claim that the traditional definition has \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose and effect to disparage and to injure\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cpersonhood and dignity\xe2\x80\x9d of same-sex couples, see ante, at 25, 26.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s limiting assurance will be meaningless in the face of language like that, as the majority well knows.  That is why the language is there.  The result will be a judicial distortion of our society\xe2\x80\x99s debate over marriage\xe2\x80\x94a debate that can seem in need of our clumsy \xe2\x80\x9chelp\xe2\x80\x9d only to a member of this institution.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs to that debate: Few public controversies touch an institution so central to the lives of so many, and few inspire such attendant passion by good people on all sides.  Few public controversies will ever demonstrate so vividly the beauty of what our Framers gave us, a gift the Court pawns today to buy its stolen moment in the spotlight: a system of government that permits us to rule ourselves.  Since DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, citizens on all sides of the question have seen victories and they have seen defeats.  There have been plebiscites, legislation, persuasion, and loud voices\xe2\x80\x94in other words, democracy.  Victories in one place for some, see North Carolina Const., Amdt. 1 (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]arriage between one man and one woman is the only domestic legal union that shall be valid or recognized in this State\xe2\x80\x9d) (approved by a popular vote, 61% to 39% on May 8, 2012),\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t are offset by victories in other places for others, see Maryland Question 6 (establishing \xe2\x80\x9cthat Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s civil marriage laws allow gay and lesbian couples to obtain a civil marriage license\xe2\x80\x9d) (approved by a popular vote, 52% to 48%, on November 6, 2012).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Even in a sin- gle State, the question has come out differently on different occasions.  Compare Maine Question 1 (permitting \xe2\x80\x9cthe State of Maine to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples\xe2\x80\x9d) (approved by a popular vote, 53% to 47%, on November 6, 2012)\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t with Maine Question 1 (rejecting \xe2\x80\x9cthe new law that lets same-sex couples marry\xe2\x80\x9d) (approved by a popular vote, 53% to 47%, on November 3, 2009).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the majority\xe2\x80\x99s telling, this story is black-and-white: Hate your neighbor or come along with us.  The truth is more complicated.  It is hard to admit that one\xe2\x80\x99s political opponents are not monsters, especially in a struggle like this one, and the challenge in the end proves more than today\xe2\x80\x99s Court can handle.  Too bad.  A reminder that dis- agreement over something so fundamental as marriage can still be politically legitimate would have been a fit task for what in earlier times was called the judicial temperament.  We might have covered ourselves with honor today, by promising all sides of this debate that it was  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\ttheirs to settle and that we would respect their resolution.

I do not understand that line.  The injury to Congress is the same whether the President has defended the statute or not.  And if the injury is threatened, why should Congress not be able to participate in the suit from the beginning, just as the President can?  And if having a statute declared unconstitutional (and therefore inoperative) by a court is an injury, why is it not an injury when a statute is declared unconstitutional by the President and rendered inoperative by his consequent failure to enforce it?  Or when the President simply declines to enforce it without opining on its constitutionality?

If this Court agreed with Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s distinction, its opinion in Raines v.

That the Federal Government treated this fundamental question differently than it treated variations over consanguinity or minimum age is hardly surprising\xe2\x80\x94and hardly enough to support a conclusion that the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 22, of the 342 Representa- tives and 85 Senators who voted for it, and the President who signed it, was a bare desire to harm.  Nor do the snip- pets of legislative history and the banal title of the Act to which the majority points suffice to make such a showing.  At least without some more convincing evidence that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal purpose was to codify malice, and that it furthered no legitimate government interests, I would not tar the political branches with the brush of bigotry.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut while I disagree with the result to which the major- ity\xe2\x80\x99s analysis leads it in this case, I think it more important to point out that its analysis leads no further.  The Court does not have before it, and the logic of its opinion does not decide, the distinct question whether the States, in the exercise of their \xe2\x80\x9chistoric and essential authority to define the marital relation,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18, may continue to utilize the traditional definition of marriage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority goes out of its way to make this explicit in the penultimate sentence of its opinion.  It states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his opinion and its holding are confined to those lawful marriages,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 26\xe2\x80\x94referring to same-sex marriages that a State has already recognized as a result of the local \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity\xe2\x80\x99s considered perspective on the historical roots of the institution of marriage and its evolving un- derstanding of the meaning of equality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 20.  Justice Scalia believes this is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bald, unreasoned disclaime[r].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 22.  In my view, though, the disclaimer is a logical and necessary consequence of the argument the majority has chosen to adopt.  The dominant theme of the majority opinion is that the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion into an area \xe2\x80\x9ccentral to state domestic relations law applicable to its residents and citizens\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d to set off alarm bells.  Ante, at 17, 20.  I think the majority goes off course, as I have said, but it is undeniable that its judgment is based on federalism.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority extensively chronicles DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s departure from the normal allocation of responsibility between State and Federal Governments, emphasizing that DOMA \xe2\x80\x9crejects the long-established precept that the incidents, benefits, and obligations of marriage are uniform for all married couples within each State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  But there is no such departure when one State adopts or keeps a definition of marriage that differs from that of its neighbor, for it is entirely expected that state definitions would \xe2\x80\x9cvary, subject to constitutional guarantees, from one State to the next.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Thus, while \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he State\xe2\x80\x99s power in defining the marital relation is of central relevance\xe2\x80\x9d to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to strike down DOMA here, ibid., that power will come into play on the other side of the board in future cases about the constitutionality of state marriage definitions.  So too will the concerns for state diversity and sovereignty that weigh against DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality in this case.  See ante, at 19.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is not just this central feature of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis that is unique to DOMA, but many considerations on the periphery as well.  For example, the majority focuses on the legislative history and title of this particular Act, ante, at 21; those statute-specific considerations will, of course, be irrelevant in future cases about different statutes.  The majority emphasizes that DOMA was a \xe2\x80\x9csystem- wide enactment with no identified connection to any particular area of federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d but a State\xe2\x80\x99s definition of marriage \xe2\x80\x9cis the foundation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s broader author- ity to regulate the subject of domestic relations with respect to the \xe2\x80\x98[p]rotection of offspring, property interests, and the enforcement of marital responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22, 17.  And the federal decision undermined (in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view) the \xe2\x80\x9cdignity [already] conferred by the States in the exercise of their sovereign power,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 21, whereas a State\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to expand the definition of marriage from its traditional contours involves no similar concern.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe may in the future have to resolve challenges to state marriage definitions affecting same-sex couples.  That issue, however, is not before us in this case, and we hold today that we lack jurisdiction to consider it in the particular context of Hollingsworth v. Perry, ante, p. ___.  I write only to highlight the limits of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding and reasoning today, lest its opinion be taken to resolve not only a question that I believe is not properly before us\xe2\x80\x94DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality\xe2\x80\x94but also a question that all agree, and the Court explicitly acknowledges, is not at issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970768">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93307\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v.

That debate is, at bottom, about the nature of the institution of marriage.  Respondent Edith Windsor, supported by the United States, asks this Court to intervene in that debate, and although she couches her argument in different terms, what she seeks is a holding that enshrines in the Constitution a particular understanding of marriage under which the sex of the partners makes no difference.  The Constitution, however, does not dictate that choice.  It leaves the choice to the people, acting through their elected representatives at both the federal and state levels.  I would therefore hold that Congress did not violate Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights by enacting \xc2\xa73 of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), \n\n110Stat.\n2419, which defines the meaning of marriage under federal statutes that either confer upon married persons cer- tain federal benefits or impose upon them certain federal obligations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI turn first to the question of standing.  In my view, the  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\tUnited States clearly is not a proper petitioner in this case.  The United States does not ask us to overturn the judgment of the court below or to alter that judgment in any way.  Quite to the contrary, the United States argues emphatically in favor of the correctness of that judgment.  We have never before reviewed a decision at the sole behest of a party that took such a position, and to do so would be to render an advisory opinion, in violation of Article III\xe2\x80\x99s dictates.  For the reasons given in Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, I do not find the Court\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary to be persuasive.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhether the Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group of the House of Representatives (BLAG) has standing to petition is a much more difficult question.

Chadha, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919 (1983)\n, the Court held that the two Houses of Congress were \xe2\x80\x9cproper parties\xe2\x80\x9d to file a petition in defense of the constitutionality of the one-house veto statute, id., at 930, n.\xc2\xa05 (internal quota- tion marks omitted).  Accordingly, the Court granted and decided petitions by both the Senate and the House, in addition to the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  Id., at 919, n.\xc2\xa0*.  That the two Houses had standing to petition is not surprising: The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision in Chadha, by holding the one-house veto to be unconstitutional, had limited Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to legislate.  In discussing Article III standing, the Court suggested that Congress suffered a similar injury whenever federal legislation it had passed was struck down, noting that it had \xe2\x80\x9clong held that Congress is the proper party to defend the validity of a statute when an agency of government, as a defendant charged with enforcing the statute, agrees with plaintiffs that the statute is inapplicable or unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 940.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe United States attempts to distinguish Chadha on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unusual statute that vested the House and the Senate themselves each with special procedural rights\xe2\x80\x94namely, the right effectively to veto Executive action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States (jurisdiction) 36.  But that is a distinction without a difference: just as the Court of Appeals decision that the Chadha Court affirmed impaired Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power by striking down the one-house veto, so the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision here impairs Congress\xe2\x80\x99 legislative power by striking down an Act of Congress.  The United States has not explained why the fact that the impairment at issue in Chadha was \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural\xe2\x80\x9d has any relevance to whether Congress suffered an injury.  Indeed, because legislating is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 central function, any impairment of that function is a more grievous injury than the impairment of a procedural add-on.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Coleman v. Miller, \n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433 (1939)\n, bolsters this conclusion.  In Coleman, we held that a group of state senators had standing to challenge a lower court decision approving the procedures used to ratify an amendment to the Federal Constitution.  We reasoned that the senators\xe2\x80\x99 votes\xe2\x80\x94which would otherwise have carried the day\xe2\x80\x94were nullified by that action.  See id., at 438 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, the plaintiffs include twenty senators, whose votes against ratification have been overridden and virtually held for naught although if they are right in their contentions their votes would have been sufficient to defeat ratification.  We think that these senators have a plain, direct and adequate interest in maintaining the ef- fectiveness of their votes\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 446 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e find no departure from principle in recognizing in the instant case that at least the twenty senators whose votes, if their contention were sustained, would have been sufficient to defeat the resolution ratifying the proposed constitutional amendment, have an interest in the controversy which, treated by the state court as a basis for entertaining and deciding the federal questions, is sufficient to give the Court jurisdiction to review that decision\xe2\x80\x9d).  By striking down \xc2\xa73 of DOMA as unconstitutional, the Second Circuit effectively \xe2\x80\x9cheld for naught\xe2\x80\x9d an Act of Congress.  Just as the state-senator-petitioners in Coleman were necessary parties to the amendment\xe2\x80\x99s ratification, the House of Representatives was a necessary party to DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s passage; indeed, the House\xe2\x80\x99s vote would have been sufficient to prevent DOMA\xe2\x80\x99s repeal if the Court had not chosen to execute that repeal judicially.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBoth the United States and the Court-appointed amicus err in arguing that Raines v. Byrd, \n\n521 U. S. 811 (1997)\n, is to the contrary.  In that case, the Court held that Members of Congress who had voted \xe2\x80\x9cnay\xe2\x80\x9d to the Line Item Veto Act did not have standing to challenge that statute in federal court.  Raines is inapposite for two reasons.  First, Raines dealt with individual Members of Congress and specifically pointed to the individual Members\xe2\x80\x99 lack of institutional endorsement as a sign of their standing problem: \xe2\x80\x9cWe attach some importance to the fact that appellees have not been authorized to represent their respective Houses of Congress in this action, and indeed both Houses actively oppose their suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 829; see also ibid., n.\xc2\xa010 (citing cases to the effect that \xe2\x80\x9cmembers of collegial bodies do not have standing to perfect an appeal the body itself has declined to take\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Members in Raines\xe2\x80\x94unlike the state senators in Coleman\xe2\x80\x94were not the pivotal figures whose votes would have caused the Act to fail absent some challenged action.  Indeed, it is telling that Raines characterized Coleman as standing \xe2\x80\x9cfor the proposition that legislators whose votes would have been sufficient to defeat (or enact) a specific legislative Act have standing to sue if that legislative action goes into effect (or does not go into effect), on the ground that their votes have been completely nullified.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U.

Family structure reflects the characteristics of a civilization, and changes in family structure and in the popular understanding of marriage and the family can have profound effects.  Past changes in the understand- ing of marriage\xe2\x80\x94for example, the gradual ascendance of the idea that romantic love is a prerequisite to marriage\xe2\x80\x94have had far-reaching consequences.  But the process by which such consequences come about is complex, involving the interaction of numerous factors, and tends to occur over an extended period of time.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe can expect something similar to take place if same-sex marriage becomes widely accepted.

And judges are  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tcertainly not equipped to make such an assessment.  The Members of this Court have the authority and the responsibility to interpret and apply the Constitution.  Thus, if the Constitution contained a provision guaranteeing the right to marry a person of the same sex, it would be our duty to enforce that right.  But the Constitution simply does not speak to the issue of same-sex marriage.  In our system of government, ultimate sovereignty rests with the people, and the people have the right to control their own destiny.  Any change on a question so fundamental should be made by the people through their elected officials.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps because they cannot show that same-sex marriage is a fundamental right under our Constitution, Windsor and the United States couch their arguments in equal protection terms.  They argue that \xc2\xa73 of DOMA discriminates on the basis of sexual orientation, that classifications based on sexual orientation should trigger a form of \xe2\x80\x9cheightened\xe2\x80\x9d scrutiny, and that \xc2\xa73 cannot survive such scrutiny.  They further maintain that the governmental interests that \xc2\xa73 purports to serve are not sufficiently important and that it has not been adequately shown that \xc2\xa73 serves those interests very well.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, too, seems to rest on \xe2\x80\x9cthe equal protection guarantee of the \n \nFourteenth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 25\xe2\x80\x94although the Court is careful not to adopt most of Windsor\xe2\x80\x99s and the United States\xe2\x80\x99 argument.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, the approach that Windsor and the United States advocate is misguided.  Our equal protection frame- work, upon which Windsor and the United States rely, is a judicial construct that provides a useful mechanism for analyzing a certain universe of equal protection cases.  But that framework is ill suited for use in evaluating the constitutionality of laws based on the traditional understanding of marriage, which fundamentally turn on what marriage is.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnderlying our equal protection jurisprudence is the central notion that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] classification \xe2\x80\x98must be reasonable, not arbitrary, and must rest upon some ground of difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reed v.

For example, the Court has held that statutory rape laws that criminalize sexual intercourse with a woman under the age of 18 years, but place no similar liability on partners of underage men, are grounded in the very real distinction that \xe2\x80\x9cyoung men and young women are not similarly situated with respect to the problems and the risks of sexual intercourse.\xe2\x80\x9d  Michael M. v.

In other contexts, however, the Court has found that classifications based on gender are \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary,\xe2\x80\x9d Reed, supra, at 76, and based on \xe2\x80\x9coutmoded notions of the relative capabilities of men and women,\xe2\x80\x9d Cleburne, supra, at 441, as when a State provides that a man must always be preferred to an equally qualified woman when both seek to administer the estate of a deceased party, see Reed, supra, at 76\xe2\x80\x9377.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, so-called rational-basis review applies to classifications based on \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguishing characteristics relevant to interests the State has the authority to implement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cleburne, supra, at 441.

That is a striking request and one that unelected judges should pause before granting.  Acceptance of the argument would cast all those who cling to traditional beliefs about the nature of marriage in the role of bigots or superstitious fools.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy asking the Court to strike down DOMA as not satisfying some form of heightened scrutiny, Windsor and the United States are really seeking to have the Court resolve a debate between two competing views of marriage.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first and older view, which I will call the \xe2\x80\x9ctradi- tional\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconjugal\xe2\x80\x9d view, sees marriage as an intrinsically opposite-sex institution.  BLAG notes that virtually every culture, including many not influenced by the Abrahamic religions, has limited marriage to people of the opposite sex.  Brief for Respondent BLAG (merits) 2 (citing Hernandez v. Robles, 7 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 3d 338, 361, 855 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1, 8 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9cUntil a few decades ago, it was an accepted truth for almost everyone who ever lived, in any society in which marriage existed, that there could be marriages only between participants of different sex\xe2\x80\x9d)).  And BLAG attempts to explain this phenomenon by arguing that the institution of marriage was created for the purpose of channeling heterosexual intercourse into a structure that supports child rearing.  Brief for Respondent BLAG 44\xe2\x80\x9346, 49.  Others explain the basis for the institution in more philosophical terms.  They argue that marriage is essentially the solemnizing of a comprehensive, exclusive, permanent union that is intrinsically ordered to producing new life, even if it does not always do so.  See, e.g., Girgis, Anderson, &amp; George, What is Marriage? Man and Woman: A Defense, at 23\xe2\x80\x9328.  While modern cultural changes have weakened the link between marriage and procreation in the popular mind, there is no doubt that, throughout human history and across many cultures, marriage has been viewed as an exclusively opposite-sex institution and as one inextricably linked to procreation and biological kinship.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe other, newer view is what I will call the \xe2\x80\x9cconsent-based\xe2\x80\x9d vision of marriage, a vision that primarily defines marriage as the solemnization of mutual commitment\xe2\x80\x94marked by strong emotional attachment and sexual attraction\xe2\x80\x94between two persons.  At least as it applies to heterosexual couples, this view of marriage now plays a very prominent role in the popular understanding of the institution.  Indeed, our popular culture is infused with this understanding of marriage.  Proponents of same-sex marriage argue that because gender differentiation is not relevant to this vision, the exclusion of same-sex couples from the institution of marriage is rank discrimination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Constitution does not codify either of these views of marriage (although I suspect it would have been hard at the time of the adoption of the Constitution or the \n \nFifth Amendment to find Americans who did not take the traditional view for granted).  The silence of the Constitution on this question should be enough to end the matter as far as the judiciary is concerned.  Yet, Windsor and the United States implicitly ask us to endorse the consent-based view of marriage and to reject the traditional view, thereby arrogating to ourselves the power to decide a question that philosophers, historians, social scientists, and theologians are better qualified to explore.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Because our consti- tutional order assigns the resolution of questions of this nature to the people, I would not presume to en- shrine either vision of marriage in our constitutional jurisprudence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLegislatures, however, have little choice but to decide between the two views.  We have long made clear that neither the political branches of the Federal Government nor state governments are required to be neutral between competing visions of the good, provided that the vision of the good that they adopt is not countermanded by the Constitution.  See, e.g., Rust v. Sullivan, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173, \n192 (1991)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he government \xe2\x80\x98may make a value judgment favoring childbirth over abortion\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Maher v. Rue, \n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 464, \n474 (1977)\n)).  Accordingly, both Congress and the States are entitled to enact laws recognizing either of the two understandings of marriage.  And given the size of government and the degree to which it now regulates daily life, it seems unlikely that either Congress or the States could maintain complete neutrality even if they tried assiduously to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRather than fully embracing the arguments made by Windsor and the United States, the Court strikes down \xc2\xa73 of DOMA as a classification not properly supported by its objectives.  The Court reaches this conclusion in part because it believes that \xc2\xa73 encroaches upon the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign prerogative to define marriage.  See ante, at 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs the title and dynamics of the bill indicate, its purpose is to discourage enactment of state same-sex marriage laws and to restrict the freedom and choice of couples married under those laws if they are enacted.

United States Dept. of Health and Human Servs., 682 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (CA1 2012))).  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusion is that DOMA falls afoul of the \n \nFifth Amendment because it \xe2\x80\x9csingles out a class of persons deemed by a State entitled to recognition and protection to enhance their own liberty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimposes a disability on the class by refusing to acknowledge a status the State finds to be dignified and proper.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 25 (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo the extent that the Court takes the position that the question of same-sex marriage should be resolved primar- ily at the state level, I wholeheartedly agree.  I hope that the Court will ultimately permit the people of each State to decide this question for themselves.  Unless the Court is willing to allow this to occur, the whiffs of federalism in the today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of the Court will soon be scattered to the wind.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, \xc2\xa73 of DOMA, in my view, does not encroach on the prerogatives of the States, assuming of course that the many federal statutes affected by DOMA have not already done so.  Section 3 does not prevent any State from recognizing same-sex marriage or from extending to same-sex couples any right, privilege, benefit, or obligation stemming from state law.  All that \xc2\xa73 does is to define a class of persons to whom federal law extends cer- tain special benefits and upon whom federal law imposes certain special burdens.  In these provisions, Congress used marital status as a way of defining this class\xe2\x80\x94in part, I assume, because it viewed marriage as a valua- ble institution to be fostered and in part because it viewed married couples as comprising a unique type of economic unit that merits special regulatory treatment.  Assuming that Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the laws affected by \xc2\xa73, Congress has the power to define the category of persons to whom those laws apply.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I would hold that \xc2\xa73 of DOMA does not violate the \n \nFifth Amendment.

Schwarzenegger, 704 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 921, 958 (ND Cal. 2010) (finding of fact no. 27) (\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage between a man and a woman was traditionally organized based on presumptions of division of labor along gender lines.  Men were seen as suited for certain types of work and women for others.  Women were seen as suited to raise children and men were seen as suited to provide for the family\xe2\x80\x9d), what marriage is, id., at 961 (finding of fact no. 34) (\xe2\x80\x9cMarriage is the state recognition and approval of a couple\xe2\x80\x99s choice to live with each other, to remain committed to one another and to form a household based on their own feelings about one another and to join in an economic partnership and support one another and any dependents\xe2\x80\x9d), and the effect legalizing same-sex marriage would have on opposite-sex marriage, id., at 972 (finding of fact no. 55) (\xe2\x80\x9cPermitting same-sex couples to marry will not affect the number of opposite-sex couples who marry, divorce, cohabit, have children outside of marriage or otherwise affect the stability of opposite-sex marriages\xe2\x80\x9d).\nAt times, the trial reached the heights of parody, as when the trial judge questioned his ability to take into account the views of great thinkers of the past because they were unavailable to testify in person in his courtroom.  See 13 Tr. in No. C 09\xe2\x80\x932292 VRW (ND Cal.), pp.\xc2\xa03038\xe2\x80\x933039.\nAnd, if this spectacle were not enough, some professors of constitutional law have argued that we are bound to accept the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings\xe2\x80\x94including those on major philosophical questions and predictions about the future\xe2\x80\x94unless they are \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Constitutional Law and Civil Procedure Professors as Amici Curiae in Hollingsworth v. Perry, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2012, No. 12\xe2\x80\x93144, pp. 2\xe2\x80\x933 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he district court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings are compelling and should be given significant weight\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 25 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder any standard of review, this Court should credit and adopt the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s findings because they result from rigorous and exacting application of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and are supported by reliable research and by the unanimous consensus of mainstream social science experts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Only an arrogant legal culture that has lost all appreciation of its own limitations could take such a suggestion seriously.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
