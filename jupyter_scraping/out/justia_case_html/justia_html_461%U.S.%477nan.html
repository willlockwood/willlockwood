These orders had the effect of partially superseding the operation of the State\'s statutory last-hired, first-fired scheme for civil service layoffs, Mass.Gen.Laws Ann., ch. 31, \xc2\xa7 39 (West 1979).  Following the Court of Appeals\' decision, Massachusetts enacted legislation providing the city of Boston with new revenues, requiring reinstatement of all police and firefighters laid off during the reductions in force, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 461 U.

Acts, ch.190, \xc2\xa7 25.  In light of these changed circumstances, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand for consideration of mootness in light of 1982 Mass. Acts, ch.190, \xc2\xa7 25.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
