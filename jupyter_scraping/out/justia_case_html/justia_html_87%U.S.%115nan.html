This leaves nothing upon which the present writ of error can act.  The judgment having been reversed, the order of confirmation of the sale, as well as the order of distribution, fall with it.  We can therefore only repeat the judgment given in the former case, which was a judgment of reversal.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 87 U.
