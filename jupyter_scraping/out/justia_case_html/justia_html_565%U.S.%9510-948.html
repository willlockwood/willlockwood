Enforcement is achieved through the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision of a private cause of action for violation, \xc2\xa71679g, as well as through federal and state administrative enforcement, \xc2\xa71679h.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike the District Court and the Ninth Circuit, respondents focus on the CROA\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure and nonwaiver provisions.  The former, which is reproduced in full in the  Appendix, infra, sets forth a statement that the credit re-pair organization must provide to the consumer before any contract is executed.  \xc2\xa71679c(a).  One sentence of that required statement reads, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98You have a right to sue a credit repair organization that violates the Credit Repair Organization Act.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s nonwaiver provision states,  \xe2\x80\x9cAny waiver by any consumer of any protection provided by or any right of the consumer under this subchapter\xe2\x80\x94 (1) shall be treated as void; and (2) may not be enforced by any Federal or State court or any other person.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71679f(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Ninth Circuit adopted the following line of reasoning, urged upon us by respondents here: The disclosure provision gives consumers the \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cclearly involves the right to bring an action in a court of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  615 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1208.  Because the nonwaiver provision prohibits the waiver of \xe2\x80\x9cany right of the consumer under this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d the arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x94which waived the right to bring an action in a court of law\xe2\x80\x94cannot be enforced.  Id., at 1214.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe flaw in this argument is its premise: that the disclosure provision provides consumers with a right to bring an action in a court of law.  It does not.  Rather, it imposes an obligation on credit repair organizations to supply consumers with a specific statement set forth (in quotation marks) in the statute.  The only consumer right it creates is the right to receive the statement, which is meant to describe the consumer protections that the law elsewhere provides.  The statement informs consumers, for instance, that they can dispute the accuracy of information in their credit file and that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he credit bureau must then reinvestigate and modify or remove inaccurate or incomplete information.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  \n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71679c(a).  That description is derived from \xc2\xa71681i(a), which sets out in great detail the procedures to be followed by a credit bureau in the event of challenges to the accuracy of its information.  Similarly, the required statement informs consumers that they may \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cancel your contract with any credit repair organization for any reason within 3 business days from the date you signed it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the right created and set forth in more detail in \xc2\xa71679e.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d language describes the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s right to enforce the credit repair organization\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cliab[ility]\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ure] to comply with any provision of this subchapter\xe2\x80\x9d provided for in \xc2\xa71679g(a).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Thus, con-trary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, our interpretation does not \xe2\x80\x9c[r]educ[e] the required disclosure to insignificance,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 6.  The disclosure provision informs consumers of their right to enforce liability for any failure to conform to the statute\xe2\x80\x94information they might otherwise not possess.  It is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation that effectively reduces a portion of the CROA to a nullity.  Interpreting the \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d language in \xc2\xa71679c(a) to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d a right to sue in court not only renders it strikingly out of place in a section that is otherwise devoted to giving the consumer notice of rights created elsewhere; it also renders the creation of the \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d elsewhere superfluous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents suggest that the CROA\xe2\x80\x99s civil-liability pro-vision, \xc2\xa71679g (set forth in full in the Appendix, infra), demonstrates that the Act provides consumers with a \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to bring an action in court.  They cite the provision\xe2\x80\x99s repeated use of the terms \xe2\x80\x9caction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cclass action,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94terms that they say call to mind a judicial proceeding.  These references cannot do the heavy lifting that respondents assign them.  It is utterly commonplace for statutes that create civil causes of action to describe the details of those causes of action, including the relief available, in the context of a court suit.  If the mere formulation of the cause of action in this standard fashion were sufficient to establish the \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary congressional com-  mand\xe2\x80\x9d overriding the FAA, McMahon, supra, at 226, valid arbitration agreements covering federal causes of action would be rare indeed.  But that is not the law.  In Gilmer we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) which read, in part: \xe2\x80\x9cAny person aggrieved may bring a civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction for such legal or equitable relief as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7626(c)(1).  In McMahon we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) which read, in part: \xe2\x80\x9cAny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962 of this chapter may sue therefor in any appropriate United States district court and shall recover threefold the damages he sustains and the cost of the suit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71964(c).  And in Mitsubishi Motors we enforced an arbitration agreement with respect to a cause of action created by a provision of the Clayton Act which read, in part: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor in any district court of the United States .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and shall recover threefold the damages by him sustained, and the cost of suit, including a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715(a).  Thus, we have repeatedly recognized that contractually required arbitration of claims satisfies the statutory prescription of civil liability in court.  See Gilmer, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 28; McMahon, 482 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 240; Mitsubishi Motors, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637.  To be sure, none of the statutes described above contained a nonwaiver provision, as the statute before us does.  But if a cause-of-action provision mentioning judicial enforcement does not create a right to initial judicial enforcement, the waiver of initial judicial enforcement is not the waiver of a \xe2\x80\x9cright of the consumer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71679f(a).  It takes a considerable stretch to regard the nonwaiver provision as a \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional command\xe2\x80\x9d that the FAA shall not apply.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, if one believes that \xc2\xa71679g\xe2\x80\x99s contemplation of court suit (combined with \xc2\xa71679f(a)) establishes a nonwaiv-able right to initial judicial enforcement, one must also believe that it establishes a nonwaivable right to initial judicial enforcement in any competent judicial tribunal, since it contains no limitation.  We think it clear, however, that this mere \xe2\x80\x9ccontemplation\xe2\x80\x9d of suit in any competent court does not guarantee suit in all competent courts, disabling the parties from adopting a reasonable forum-selection clause.  And just as the contemplated availability of all judicial forums may be reduced to a single forum by contractual specification, so also can the contemplated availability of judicial action be limited to judicial action compelling or reviewing initial arbitral adjudication.  The parties remain free to specify such matters, so long as the guarantee of \xc2\xa71679g\xe2\x80\x94the guarantee of the legal power to impose liability\xe2\x80\x94is preserved.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondents and the dissent maintain that if the CROA does not create a right to a judicial forum, then the disclosure provision effectively requires that credit repair organizations mislead consumers.  We think not.  The disclosure provision is meant to describe the law to consumers in a manner that is concise and comprehensible to the layman\xe2\x80\x94which necessarily means that it will be imprecise.  The required statement says, for example, that the CROA \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98prohibits deceptive practices by credit repair organiza-  tions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71679c(a).  This is in some respects an overstatement, and in some respects an understatement, of the \xe2\x80\x9cProhibited practices\xe2\x80\x9d set forth in \xc2\xa71679b.  It would include, for example, deception apart from \xe2\x80\x9cthe offer or sale of the services of the credit repair organization,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71679b(a)(4).  Yet we would not hold, in order to prevent the required statement from being \xe2\x80\x9cmisleading,\xe2\x80\x9d that a consumer has a right to be protected from deceptive practices beyond those actually covered by \xc2\xa71679b.  So also with respect to the statement\xe2\x80\x99s description of a \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is a colloquial method of communicating to consumers that they have the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the CROA.  We think most consumers would understand it this way, without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.  Leaving that possibility out may be imprecise, but it is not misleading\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not so misleading as to demand, in order to avoid that result, reading the statute to contain a guaranteed right it does not in fact contain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the time of the CROA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1996, arbitration clauses in contracts of the type at issue here were no rarity.

Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., \n, and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he burden is on the party opposing arbitration . . . to show that Congress intended to preclude a waiver of judicial remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, \n.  To the extent Congress is ever \xe2\x80\x9cstimulated\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, post, at 8, there is no reason to think the Congress that enacted the CROA was any less stimulated than subsequent Congresses.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963674">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x93948\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tCOMPUCREDIT CORPORATION, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20, \n26 (1991)\n.  I agree with the Court that Congress has not shown that intent here.  But for the reasons stated by the dissent, I find this to be a much closer case than the majority opinion suggests.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act creates a cause of action in its liability provision, see \xc2\xa71679g(a),\xc2\xa0denominates the cause of action a \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d in the mandatory disclosure statement, \xc2\xa71679c(a), and then provides that \xe2\x80\x9cright[s]\xe2\x80\x9d may not be waived, \xc2\xa71679f(a).  Those for whom Congress wrote the Act\xe2\x80\x94lay readers \xe2\x80\x9cof limited economic means and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. inexperienced in credit matters,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71679(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x94reasonably may interpret the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d as promising a right to sue in court.  And it is plausible to think that Congress, aware of the impact of its words, intended such a construction of the liability provision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut while this interpretation of the Act is plausible, it is in my view no more compelling than the contrary construction that petitioners urge.  As the majority opinion notes, the disclosure provision does not itself confer a cause of action, and the liability provision that does is materially indistinguishable from other statutes that we have held not to preclude arbitration.  In my mind this leaves the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments in equipoise, and our precedents require that petitioners prevail in this circumstance.  This is because respondents, as the opponents of arbitration, bear the burden of showing that Congress disallowed arbitration of their claims, and because we resolve doubts in favor of arbitration.  See id., at 26.  Of course, if we have misread Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, then Congress can correct our error by amending the statute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI add one more point.  The majority opinion contrasts the liability provision of the Act with other, more recently enacted statutes that expressly disallow arbitration.  I do not understand the majority opinion to hold that Congress must speak so explicitly in order to convey its intent to preclude arbitration of statutory claims.  We have never said as much, and on numerous occasions have held that proof of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent may also be discovered in the history or purpose of the statute in question.  See ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9cIf such an intention exists, it will be discoverable in the text of the [statute], its legislative history, or an \xe2\x80\x98inherent conflict\xe2\x80\x99 between arbitration and the [statute\xe2\x80\x99s] underlying purposes\xe2\x80\x9d); Shearson/American Express Inc. v. McMahon, \n\n482 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220, \n227 (1987)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress did intend to limit or prohibit waiver of a judicial forum for a particular claim, such an intent \xe2\x80\x98will be deducible from [the statute\xe2\x80\x99s] text or legislative history,\xe2\x80\x99 or from an inherent conflict between arbitration and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s underlying pur-poses\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614, \n628 (1985)\n; citation omitted)).  I agree with the dissent that the statutes the  majority opinion cites shed little light on the thoughts of the Congress that passed the Act.  But the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text is not dispositive, and respondents identify nothing in the legislative history or purpose of the Act that would tip the balance of the scale in favor of their interpretation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963671">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 10\xe2\x80\x93948\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tCOMPUCREDIT CORPORATION, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS v.

Central to the legislation, Congress sought to arm consumers with information needed to make intelligent decisions about purchasing a repair organization\xe2\x80\x99s services.

Recall, as well, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 findings that these individuals are often \xe2\x80\x9cof limited economic means and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. inexperienced in credit matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71679(a)(2).  Attributing little importance to this context, the Court construes the right to sue as \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. without regard to whether the suit in court has to be preceded by an arbitration proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  I read Congress\xe2\x80\x99 words without that sophisticated gloss: The right to sue, I would hold, means the right to litigate in court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court is quite right in recognizing that consumers \xe2\x80\x9chave the legal right, enforceable in court, to recover damages from credit repair organizations that violate the CROA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But the Court is quite wrong, as I see it, to characterize as merely \xe2\x80\x9cimprecise,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to include the caveat that access to court may be conditioned upon an anterior arbitration.  The \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d may well be \xe2\x80\x9ca colloquial method of communicating to consumers.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ibid.  But it surely is not colloquially understood by recipients of the required disclosures as the right, not to adjudicate in court, but only to seek, or defend against, court enforcement of an award rendered by the arbitrator chosen by the credit repair organization.  Few, if any, credit repair customers would equate the \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71679c(a), with the extremely limited judicial review given to an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s award, see, e.g., Hall Street Associates, L. L. C. v.

See ante, at 5.  Despite similar statutory language, the Court observes, we have enforced arbitration agreements to settle disputes arising under other Acts of Congress.  The CROA, how- ever, is distinguished by its disclosure requirements, prime among them, the obligation imposed on the credit repair organization to inform potential customers they \xe2\x80\x9chave a right to sue\xe2\x80\x9d an organization that violates the Act.  \xc2\xa71679c(a).  Yet the Court refuses to read this language in concert with \xc2\xa71679g, notwithstanding our frequent acknowledgment that \xe2\x80\x9ca statute is to be read as a whole, since the meaning of statutory language .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. depends on context.\xe2\x80\x9d  King v. St. Vincent\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital, \n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 215, \n221 (1991)\n (citation omitted).  As just explained, I believe Congress meant what an ordinary reader of the disclosure requirement would likely comprehend: A credit repair organization that engages in deceptive practices may be sued in court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tReducing the required disclosure to insignificance, see ante, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the CROA scarcely advances the Act\xe2\x80\x99s goals.  Congress aimed to ensure prospective customers \xe2\x80\x9care provided with the information necessary to make an informed decision,\xe2\x80\x9d and also to \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the public from unfair or deceptive advertising and business practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71679(b).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, however, enables the very deception Congress sought to suppress.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision permits credit repair organizations to deny consumers, through fine print in a contract, an important right whose disclosure is decreed in the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis unfortunate result is not compelled by our precedents.  The Court cites three decisions for the proposition, by now uncontroversial, that the mere existence of a stat- utory right of action does not preclude agreements to arbitrate disputes.  See ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (citing Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20, \n28 (1991)\n; Shearson/American Express Inc. v.

As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 6, none of the statutes at issue in those cases contained a nonwaiver clause analogous to \xc2\xa71679f.  Yet the presence of such a clause would not have affected the outcome, the Court maintains; a nonwaiver provision would not have precluded arbitration because the statutes conferred no underlying right to proceed in court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPrecisely the point: The CROA differs from the statutes we have construed in the past in just that respect.  The Act does not merely create a claim for relief.  It designates that claim as an action entailing a \xe2\x80\x9cright to sue\xe2\x80\x9d; mandates that consumers be informed, prior to entering any contract, of that right; and precludes the waiver of any \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d conferred by the Act.  Neither Gilmer, McMahon, nor Mitsubishi construed a statute of a similar order.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s final point is that, elsewhere, Congress has spoken with particular clarity in guaranteeing a judicial forum and proscribing arbitration, but here, it did not do so.  The two statutes the Court cites as exemplary postdate the CROA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment by 14 and 6 years, respectively.  (A third merely delegates regulatory authority over certain arbitration agreements.)  See ante, at 9.  Notably, these recent statutes were framed following a string of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions compelling arbitration pursuant to contractual stipulations.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Our decisions have increasingly alerted Congress to the utility of drafting antiwaiver prescriptions with meticulous care.  But the Congress that drafted the CROA was not similarly stimulated, and we cannot fairly assess that enactment in the light of subsequent legislative responses to developments unknown to the CROA\xe2\x80\x99s drafters.
