The hearing was scheduled without notice to Smith\'s mother and next friend, Ms. Alexzene Hamilton, despite the fact that Ms. Hamilton had appeared as petitioner on Smith\'s behalf as early as May 7, 1988.

Instead, we need judge only the adequacy of the state procedures used to determine his competency. These, I submit, were dubious procedures indeed . In Ford v. Wainwright, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/399/case.html">477 U.S. 399</a>, 410-418, 2602-2606 (1986) (plurality opinion), Justice MARSHALL outlined certain procedures to be used in ascertaining the sanity of a prisoner prior to execution. Justice MARSHALL stressed the importance of an adversarial proceeding, noting that "without any adversarial assistance from the prisoner\'s representative-especially when the psychiatric opinion he proffers is based on much more extensive evaluation than that of the state-appointed commission-the factfinder loses the substantial benefit of potentially probative information." Id., at 414. In addition, Justice MARSHALL observed that "[c]ross-examination of the psychiatrists, or perhaps a less formal equivalent, would contribute markedly to the process of seeking truth in sanity disputes by bringing to light </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1019">Page 497 U.S. 1016 , 1019</a></p><p> the bases for each expert\'s beliefs, the precise factors underlying those beliefs, any history of error or caprice of the examiner, any personal bias with respect to the issue of capital punishment, the expert\'s degree of certainty about his or her own conclusions, and the precise meaning of ambiguous words used in the report." Id., at 415. In sum, Justice MARSHALL found that "any procedure that precludes the prisoner or his counsel from presenting material relevant to his sanity or bars consideration of that material by the factfinder is necessarily inadequate" and that "the adversar[ial] presentation of relevant information [must] be as unrestricted as possible." Id., at 414, 417, 2605. Although these procedures are not directly applicable in a context in which prisoners seeking to waive their appeals actively resist appointment of counsel on their behalf, they might provide a useful guide. I would grant the petitions for certiorari to examine this important question. </p><p> A related issue presented by the instant case results from the failure of the District Court to grant an evidentiary hearing of its own. Both the District Court and the Fifth Circuit accorded the state trial court\'s findings deference despite the procedural inadequacies of the state-court proceedings. The District Court believed that it was "bound by the state court\'s findings," Civ. Action No. H-90-2011 (June 24, 1990), p. 7 and the Fifth Circuit maintained that because the findings were " fairly supported by the record," they were "binding" on the Court of Appeals. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/905/825/">905 F.2d 825</a>, 828 (1990). Regardless of a State\'s obligation to provide a competency hearing, it is clearly error for a federal court to accord deference to state-court findings when the state hearing is procedurally inadequate. A federal court is obliged to hold its own evidentiary hearing on habeas corpus if, among other factors, "the factfinding procedure employed by the State court was not adequate to afford a full and fair hearing," 28 U.S.C. 2254(d)(2); or "the material facts were not adequately developed at the State court hearing," 2254(d)( 3), or "the applicant did not receive a full, fair, and adequate hearing in the State court proceeding." 2254(d)(6). This case presents the important legal question of the procedures required to determine the competence of a prisoner to forgo further appeals, a question which has relevance both for state courts and for federal courts reviewing the state- court findings on habeas corpus. </p><p> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1020">Page 497 U.S. 1016 , 1020</a></p><p> II </p><p> Even apart from the merits of the instant case, I would grant the applications for stay of execution pending disposition of the petitions for certiorari. I adhere to my view that the death penalty is in all circumstances cruel and unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. See Gregg v. Georgia, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/case.html#227">428 U.S. 153, 227</a>, 2950 (1976) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). </p><p> Justice BLACKMUN and Justice STEVENS dissent and would grant the applications for stay. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] There is a great deal of evidence casting Smith\'s competence in doubt. Smith has had a long history of mental illness dating from his discharge from the Navy and his hospitalization for psychiatric evaluation in the Great Lakes Naval Hospital in 1972. In 1978, he was found not guilty by reason of insanity in a robbery prosecution by a Florida state court. In 1981, he attempted suicide and was placed under psychiatric care. In 1985, the Texas trial court determined that Smith was not competent to handle his appeal and appointed an attorney to prosecute his appeal. Smith has suffered several head injuries in car accidents and falls. Smith\'s mother has retained a clinical psychologist-an associate professor at Florida State University-who has sought access to Smith for the purpose of performing neurological tests. Although these tests have not yet been conducted, the psychologist has formed a conclusion on the basis of existing evidence:</p><ul>"I have formed a professional opinion with a reasonable degree of medical certainty concerning James Edwards Smith\'s current mental state. My opinion is that Mr. Smith has a history of schizophrenia that appears to be paranoid in nature, marked by suicidal tendencies and religious delusions. There is also the possibility of organic brain damage, indicated by Mr. Smith\'s history of head injuries, drug and alcohol abuse, and symptoms of neurological damage. At this time, based on Mr. Smith\'s condition, it is my opinion that he is mentally ill; that this illness prevents Mr. Smith from understanding his actual legal position and the options available to him; and that this illness prevents Mr. Smith from making a rational choice among his options."
