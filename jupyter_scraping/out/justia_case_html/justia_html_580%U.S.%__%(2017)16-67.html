Respondent Daniel Pauly was involved in a road-rage incident on a highway near Santa\xc2\xa0Fe, New Mexico.  814 F.\xc2\xa03d 1060, 1064\xe2\x80\x931065 (CA10 2016).  It was in the evening, and it was raining.  The two women involved called 911 to report Daniel as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98drunk driver\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98swerving all crazy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1065.  The women then followed Daniel down the highway, close behind him and with their bright lights on.  Daniel, feeling threatened, pulled his truck over at an off-ramp to confront them.  After a brief, nonviolent encounter, Daniel drove a short distance to a secluded house where he lived with his brother, Samuel Pauly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Sometime between 9 p.m. and 10 p.m., Officer Kevin Truesdale was dispatched to respond to the women\xe2\x80\x99s 911 call.  Truesdale, arriving after Daniel had already left the scene, interviewed the two women at the off-ramp.  The women told Truesdale that Daniel had been driving recklessly and gave his license plate number to Truesdale.  The state police dispatcher identified the plate as being registered to the Pauly brothers\xe2\x80\x99 address.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the women left, Officer Truesdale was joined at the off-ramp by Officers Ray White and Michael Mariscal.  The three agreed there was insufficient probable cause to arrest Daniel.  Still, the officers decided to speak with Daniel to (1) get his side of the story, (2) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98make sure nothing else happened,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) find out if he was intoxicated.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1065.  The officers split up.  White stayed at the off-ramp in case Daniel returned.  Truesdale and Mariscal drove in separate patrol cars to the Pauly brothers\xe2\x80\x99 address, less than a half mile away.  Record 215.  Neither officer turned on his flashing lights.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When Officers Mariscal and Truesdale arrived at the address they had received from the dispatcher, they found two different houses, the first with no lights on inside and a second one behind it on a hill.  <i>Id.,</i> at 217, 246.  Lights were on in the second one.  The officers parked their cars near the first house.  They examined a vehicle parked near that house but did not find Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  <i>Id.,</i> at 310.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Officers Mariscal and Truesdale noticed the lights on in the second house and approached it in a covert manner to maintain officer safety.  Both used their flashlights in an intermittent manner.  Truesdale alone turned on his flashlight once they got close to the house\xe2\x80\x99s front door.  Upon reaching the house, the officers found Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s pickup truck and spotted two men moving around inside the residence.  Truesdale and Mariscal radioed White, who left the off-ramp to join them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At approximately 11 p.m., the Pauly brothers became aware of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 presence and yelled out \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98What do you want?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1066.  In response, Officers Mariscal and Truesdale laughed and responded: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Hey, (expletive), we got you surrounded.  Come out or we\xe2\x80\x99re coming in.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Truesdale shouted once: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, State Police, open the door.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Mariscal also yelled: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, open the door.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Pauly brothers heard someone yelling, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We\xe2\x80\x99re coming in.  We\xe2\x80\x99re coming in.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Neither Samuel nor Daniel heard the officers identify themselves as state police.  Record 81\xe2\x80\x9382.  The brothers armed themselves, Samuel with a handgun and Daniel with a shotgun.  One of the brothers yelled at the police officers that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We have guns.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1066<i>.</i>  The officers saw someone run to the back of the house, so Officer Truesdale positioned himself behind the house and shouted \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Open the door, come outside.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Officer White had parked at the first house and was walking up to its front door when he heard shouting from the second house.  He half-jogged, half-walked to the Paulys\xe2\x80\x99 house, arriving \xe2\x80\x9cjust as one of the brothers said: \xe2\x80\x98We have guns.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also Civ. No. 12\xe2\x80\x931311 (D NM, Feb. 5, 2014), App. to Pet. for Cert. 75\xe2\x80\x9378.  When White heard that statement, he drew his gun and took cover behind a stone wall 50 feet from the front of the house.  Officer Mariscal took cover behind a pickup truck.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Just \xe2\x80\x9ca few seconds\xe2\x80\x9d after the \xe2\x80\x9cWe have guns\xe2\x80\x9d statement, Daniel stepped part way out of the back door and fired two shotgun blasts while screaming loudly.  814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1066\xe2\x80\x931067.  A few seconds after those shots, Samuel opened the front window and pointed a handgun in Officer White\xe2\x80\x99s direction.  Officer Mariscal fired immediately at Samuel but missed.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Four to five seconds\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d later, White shot and killed Samuel.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1067.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court denied the officers\xe2\x80\x99 motions for summary judgment, and the facts are viewed in the light most favorable to the Paulys.  <i>Mullenix</i> v. <i>Luna</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n. (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 2, n.).  Because this case concerns the defense of qualified immunity, however, the Court considers only the facts that were knowable to the defendant officers.  <i>Kingsley</i> v. <i>Hendrickson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s estate and Daniel filed suit against, <i>inter alia</i>, Officers Mariscal, Truesdale, and White.  One of the claims was that the officers were liable under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, for violating Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force.  All three officers moved for summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds.  White in particular argued that the Pauly brothers could not show that White\xe2\x80\x99s use of force vio-lated the\n \nFourth Amendment and, regardless, that Sam-uel\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFourth Amendment right to be free from deadlyforce under the circumstances of this case was not clearly established.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court denied qualified immunity.  A di-vided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuitaffirmed.  As to Officers Mariscal and Truesdale, the court held that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ccepting as true plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 version of the facts, a reasonable person in the officers\xe2\x80\x99 position should have understood their conduct would cause Samuel and Daniel Pauly to defend their home and could result in the commission of deadly force against Samuel Pauly by Officer White.\xe2\x80\x9d  814 F. 3d, at 1076.  The panel majority analyzed Officer White\xe2\x80\x99s claim separately from the other officers because \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer White did not participate in the events leading up to the armed confrontation, nor was he there to hear the other officers ordering the brothers to \xe2\x80\x98Come out or we\xe2\x80\x99re coming in.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer White .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. arrived late on the scene and heard only \xe2\x80\x98We have guns\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. before taking cover behind a stone wall,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority held that a jury could have concluded that White\xe2\x80\x99s use of deadly force was not reasonable.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1077, 1082.  The majority also decided that this rule\xe2\x80\x94that a reasonable officer in White\xe2\x80\x99s position would believe that a warning was required despite the threat of serious harm\xe2\x80\x94was clearly established at the time of Samuel\xe2\x80\x99s death.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling relied on general statements from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law that (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasonableness of an officer\xe2\x80\x99s use of force depends, in part, on whether the officer was in danger at the precise moment that he used force\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cif the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon[,] deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if[,] where feasible, some warning has been given.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1083 (citing, <i>inter alia</i>, <i>Tennessee</i> v. <i>Garner</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (1985)\n, and <i>Graham</i> v. <i>Connor</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386 (1989)\n; emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks and alterations omitted).  The court concluded that a reasonable officer in White\xe2\x80\x99s position would have known that, since the Paulys could not have shot him unless he moved from his position behind a stone wall, he could not have used deadly force without first warning Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Judge Moritz dissented, contending that the \xe2\x80\x9cmajority impermissibly second-guesses\xe2\x80\x9d Officer White\xe2\x80\x99s quick choice to use deadly force.  814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1084.  Judge Moritz explained that the majority also erred by defining the clearly established law at too high a level of generality, in contravention of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> The officers petitioned for rehearing en banc, which 6 of the 12 judges on the Court of Appeals voted to grant.  In a dissent from denial of rehearing, Judge Hartz noted that he was \xe2\x80\x9cunaware of any clearly established law that suggests .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that an officer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. who faces an occupant pointing a firearm in his direction must refrain from firing his weapon but, rather, must identify himself and shout a warning while pinned down, kneeling behind a rock wall.\xe2\x80\x9d  817 F.\xc2\xa03d 715, 718 (CA10 2016).  Judge Hartz expressed his hope that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Supreme Court can clarify the governing law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>.<i>,</i> at 719.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The officers petitioned for certiorari.  The petition is now granted, and the judgment is vacated: Officer White did not violate clearly established law on the record described by the Court of Appeals panel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Qualified immunity attaches when an official\xe2\x80\x99s conduct \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Mullenix</i> v. <i>Luna</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  While this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98do[es] not require a case directly on point\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for a right to be clearly established, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98existing precedent must have placed the statutory or constitutional question beyond debate.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5).  In other words, immunity protects \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the last five years, this Court has issued a number of opinions reversing federal courts in qualified immunity cases.  See<i>, e.g., City and County of San Francisco</i> v. <i>Sheehan</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n. 3 (2015) (slip op., at 10, n.3) (collecting cases).  The Court has found this necessary both because qualified immunity is important to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98society as a whole,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, and because as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an immunity from suit,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d qualified immunity \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Pearson</i> v. <i>Callahan</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223,\n231 (2009)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, it is again necessary to reiterate the longstanding principle that \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d should not be defined \xe2\x80\x9cat a high level of generality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ashcroft</i> v. <i>al-Kidd</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 731,\n742 (2011)\n.  As this Court explained decades ago, the clearly established law must be \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized\xe2\x80\x9d to the facts of the case.  <i>Anderson</i> v. <i>Creighton</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635,\n640 (1987)\n.  Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]laintiffs would be able to convert the rule of qualified immunity .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into a rule of virtually unqualified liability simply by alleging violation of extremely abstract rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 639.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The panel majority misunderstood the \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d analysis: It failed to identify a case where an officer acting under similar circumstances as Officer White was held to have violated the\n \nFourth Amendment.  Instead, the majority relied on <i>Graham</i>, <i>Garner</i>, and their Court of Appeals progeny, which\xe2\x80\x94as noted above\xe2\x80\x94lay out excessive-force principles at only a general level.  Of course, \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning\xe2\x80\x9d to officers, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Lanier</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259,\n271 (1997)\n, but \xe2\x80\x9cin the light of pre-existing law the unlawfulness must be apparent,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Anderson </i>v. <i>Creighton</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 640.<i> </i>For that reason, we have held that <i>Garner </i>and<i> Graham</i> do notby themselves create clearly established law outside\xe2\x80\x9can obvious case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brosseau</i> v. <i>Haugen</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 194\n,199 (2004) (<i>per curiam</i>); see also <i>Plumhoff</i> v. <i>Rickard</i>,572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 13) (emphasiz-ing that <i>Garner </i>and <i>Graham</i> \xe2\x80\x9care \xe2\x80\x98cast at a high level of generality\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is not a case where it is obvious that there was a violation of clearly established law under <i>Garner </i>and <i>Graham</i>.  Of note, the majority did not conclude that White\xe2\x80\x99s conduct\xe2\x80\x94such as his failure to shout a warning\xe2\x80\x94constituted a run-of-the-mill\n \nFourth Amendment violation.  Indeed, it recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthis case presents a unique set of facts and circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d in light of White\xe2\x80\x99s late arrival on the scene.  814 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1077.  This alone should have been an important indication to the majority that White\xe2\x80\x99s conduct did not violate a \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d right.  Clearly established federal law does not prohibit a reasonable officer who arrives late to an ongoing police action in circumstances like this from assuming that proper procedures, such as officer identification, have already been followed.  No settled\n \nFourth Amendment principle requires that officer to second-guess the earlier steps already taken by his or her fellow officers in instances like the one White confronted here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the record described by the Court of Appeals, Officer White did not violate clearly established law.  The Court notes, however, that respondents contend Officer White arrived on the scene only two minutes after Officers Truesdale and Mariscal and more than three minutes before Daniel\xe2\x80\x99s shots were fired.  On the assumption that the conduct of Officers Truesdale and Mariscal did not adequately alert the Paulys that they were police officers, respondents suggest that a reasonable jury could infer that White witnessed the other officers\xe2\x80\x99 deficient performance and should have realized that corrective action was necessary before using deadly force.  Brief in Opposition 11, 22, n.\xc2\xa05.  This Court expresses no position on this potential alternative ground for affirmance, as it appears that neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals panel addressed it.  The Court also expresses no opinion on the question whether this ground was properly preserved or whether\xe2\x80\x94in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today\xe2\x80\x94Officers Truesdale and Mariscal are entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the foregoing reasons, the petition for certiorari is granted; the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated; and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3674529">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">RAY WHITE, et\xc2\xa0al. <i>v.</i> DANIEL T.

Further, as to Officer White, the Court, as I comprehend its opinion, leaves open the propriety of denying summary judgment based on fact disputes over when Officer White arrived at the scene, what he may have witnessed, and whether he had adequate time to identify himself and order Samuel Pauly to drop his weapon before Officer White shot Pauly.
