As a result of its consideration of these matters, including the representations made by the State of Texas in its <em>amicus curiae</em> brief, the Court is of the opinion that the issues in this litigation are so related to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 354 U.

Meanwhile such motions are continued.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE CLARK took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
