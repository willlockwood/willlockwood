Adams Express Co.,</em> 165 F. 152.  From this decree, no appeal was taken.</p>\n<p>A second suit on the same alleged cause of action was then brought in the name of the officers of the company, Levi C. Weir and others, alleging their diverse citizenship.  The second suit was dismissed by the circuit court, and carried to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, and the latter court affirmed the decree of the circuit court.  173 F. 776.</p>\n<p>This appeal was then prosecuted, but we are of opinion that it cannot be maintained.  <em>Colorado Central Consolidated Mining Co. v.
