At trial, the Government advanced the theory that Fuller was attacked by a large group of individuals.  Its evidentiary centerpiece consisted of the testimony of Calvin Alston and Harry Bennett, who confessed to participating in a group attack and cooperated with the Government in return for leniency.  Several other Government witnesses corroborated aspects of Alston\xe2\x80\x99s and Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.  Melvin Montgomery testified that he was in a park among a group of people, heard someone say they were \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to get that one,\xe2\x80\x9d saw petitioner Overton pointing to Fuller, and saw several persons, including some petitioners, cross the street in her direction.  Maurice Thomas testified that he saw the attack, identified some petitioners as participants, and later overheard petitioner Catlett say that they \xe2\x80\x9chad to kill her.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carrie Eleby and Linda Jacobs testified that they heard screams coming from an alley where a \xe2\x80\x9cgang of boys\xe2\x80\x9d was beating someone near a garage, approached the group, and saw some petitioners participating in the attack.  Finally, the Government played a videotape of petitioner Yarborough\xe2\x80\x99s statement to detectives, describing how he was part of a large group that carried out the attack.  None of the defendants rebutted the prosecution witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 claims that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  The seven petitioners were convicted.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Long after their convictions became final, petitioners discovered that the Government had withheld evidence from the defense at the time of trial.  In postconviction proceedings, they argued that seven specific pieces of withheld evidence were both favorable to the defense and material to their guilt under <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n.  This evidence included the identity of a man seen running into the alley after the murder and stopping near the garage where Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body had already been found; the statement of a passerby who claimed to hear groans coming from a closed garage; and evidence tending to impeach witnesses Eleby, Jacobs, and Thomas.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Superior Court rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <i>Brady</i> claims, finding that the withheld evidence was not material.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: The withheld evidence is not material under <i>Brady.  </i>Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Government does not contest petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the withheld evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cfavorable to the defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Petitioners and the Government, however, do contest the materiality of the undisclosed <i>Brady </i>information.

Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 main argument is that, had they known about the withheld evidence, they could have challenged the Government\xe2\x80\x99s basic group attack theory by raising an alternative theory, namely, that a single perpetrator (or two at most) had attacked Fuller.  Considering the withheld evidence \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of the entire record,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Agurs</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 112, that evidence is too little, too weak, or too distant from the main evidentiary points to meet <i>Brady</i>\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">A group attack was the very cornerstone of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case, and virtually every witness to the crime agreed that Fuller was killed by a large group of perpetrators.  It is not reasonably probable that the withheld evidence could have led to a different result at trial.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 problem is that their current alternative theory would have had to persuade the jury that both Alston and Bennett falsely confessed to being active participants in a group attack that never occurred; that Yarborough falsely implicated himself in that group attack and yet gave a highly similar account of how it occurred; that Thomas, an otherwise disinterested witness, wholly fabricated his story; that both Eleby and Jacobs likewise testified to witnessing a group attack that did not occur; and that Montgomery in fact did not see petitioners and others, as a group, identify Fuller as a target and leave together to rob her.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">As for the undisclosed impeachment evidence, the record shows that it was largely cumulative of impeachment evidence petitioners already had and used at trial.  This is not to suggest that impeachment evidence is immaterial with respect to a witness who has already been impeached with other evidence, see <i>Wearry </i>v. <i>Cain</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  But in the context of this trial, with respect to these witnesses, the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence is insufficient to undermine confidence in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, see <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Cain</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 73\n\xe2\x80\x9376.

In 1985 the seven petitioners in these cases were tried together in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia for the kidnaping, armed robbery, and murder of Catherine Fuller.  Long after petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions became final, it emerged that the Government possessed certain evidence that it failed to disclose to the defense.  The only question before us here is whether that withheld evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial\xe2\x80\x9d under <i>Brady</i>.  The D.\xc2\xa0C.

The evidence produced at their joint trial showed that on October 1, 1984, at around 4:30 p.m., Catherine Fuller left her home to go shopping.  At around 6 p.m., William Freeman, a street vendor, found Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body inside an alley garage between Eighth and Ninth Street N. E., just a few blocks from Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s home.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i> (showing a map of the area in which the murder was committed).  Fuller had been robbed, severely beaten, and sodomized with an object that caused extensive internal injuries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government advanced the theory at trial that Fuller had been attacked in the alley by a large group of individuals, including petitioners; codefendants Steve Webb, Alfonso Harris, and Felicia Ruffin; as well as by Calvin Alston and Harry Bennett.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary centerpiece consisted of testimony by Alston and Bennett, who confessed to participating in the offense and who cooperated with the Government in return for leniency.  Although the testimony of Alston and Bennett diverged on minor details, it was consistent in stating that, and describing how, Fuller was attacked by a siz-able group of individuals, including petitioners and they themselves.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Alston testified that at about 4:10 p.m. on the day of the murder, he arrived in a park located on H Street between Eighth and Ninth Streets.  He said he found a group of people gathered there.  It included petitioners Levy Rouse, Russell Overton, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, Kelvin Smith, Clifton Yarborough, and Timothy Catlett, as well as several codefendants and others.  Those in the group were talking and singing while Catlett was banging out a beat.  Alston suggested \xe2\x80\x9cgetting paid\xe2\x80\x9d by robbing someone.  App. A467.  Catlett, Overton, Rouse, Smith, Charles Turner, Christopher Turner, Yarborough, and several others agreed.  Alston pointed at Catherine Fuller, who was walking on the other side of H Street near the corner of H and Eighth Streets.  Those in the group said they were \xe2\x80\x9cgame for getting paid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at A471\xe2\x80\x93A472.  Alston, Rouse, Yarborough, and Charles Turner crossed H Street moving toward Eighth Street and followed Fuller down Eighth Street.  The rest of the group crossed H Street and moved toward Ninth Street.  When Alston\xe2\x80\x99s group approached Fuller, Charles Turner shoved her into an alley that runs between Eighth and Ninth Streets.  Charles Turner, Rouse, and Alston began punching Fuller.  They were soon joined by Christopher Turner, Smith, and others.  All of them continued to hit and kick Fuller until she fell to the ground.  Rouse and Charles Turner then carried Fuller to the center of the alley and dropped her in front of a garage located at the point where the alley joins another, perpendicular alley that runs toward I Street.  Someone dragged Fuller into the garage.  Alston, Rouse, Charles Turner, Overton, Yarborough, and Catlett followed.  Others stood outside.  Members of the group tore Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s clothes off and struggled over her change purse.  Overton and Charles Turner then held Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s legs, and Alston, Catlett, Harris, and Yarborough stood around her while Rouse sodomized her with a foot-long pipe.  Shortly after, the group dispersed and left the alley.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Harry Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was similar.  Bennett also described a group attack.  He said that he had gone to the H Street park, where he saw Rouse, Overton, Christopher Turner, Smith, Catlett, and others gathered.  Alston was talking to the group about \xe2\x80\x9c[g]etting paid\xe2\x80\x9d and said \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s go get that lady.\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Id.,</i> at A368\xe2\x80\x93A370.  At that point Alston, Rouse, Overton, and Webb crossed H Street and approached Fuller, while Catlett, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, and Harris followed in a separate group.  Bennett added that he himself went to the corner of Eighth and H Streets to watch for police.  He then went into the alley and joined the group in kicking and beating Fuller.  He testified that at least 12 people were there, with some beating Fuller and others watching or picking up her jewelry.  Overton then dragged Fuller into the garage, and Bennett, Rouse, Christopher Turner, Charles Turner, Catlett, Smith, Harris, and Webb followed, as did some \xe2\x80\x9cgirls.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at A402\xe2\x80\x93A405.  Alston and Steve Webb held Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s legs, and Rouse sodomized her with a pole.  The group then dispersed from the garage and alley.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government presented several other witnesses who corroborated aspects of Alston\xe2\x80\x99s and Bennett\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, including the fact that Fuller was attacked by a group.  Melvin Montgomery testified that he was in the H Street park on the afternoon of the murder. He saw Overton, Catlett, Rouse, Charles Turner, and others gathered there.  The group was being noisy and singing a song about needing money.  Somebody then said they were \xe2\x80\x9cgoing to get that one,\xe2\x80\x9d and Montgomery saw that Overton was pointing to a woman standing on the corner of Eighth Street.  <i>Id.,</i> at 77\xe2\x80\x9379.  Overton, Catlett, Rouse, Charles Turner, and others crossed H Street.  Some headed toward Eighth Street while others went toward Ninth Street.  Montgomery did not follow them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Maurice Thomas, then 14 years old, testified that he witnessed the attack itself.  Thomas lived in the neighborhood and knew many of the defendants.  As he was walking home, he glanced down the Eighth Street alley and saw a group surrounding Fuller.  Thomas saw Catlett pat Fuller down and then hit her.  He then saw everyone in the group join in hitting her.  Thomas said he knew Catlett, Yarborough, Rouse, Charles Turner, Christopher Turner, and Smith and recognized them in the group.  Thomas heard Fuller calling for help.  He ran home where he found his aunt, who told him not to tell anyone what he saw.  Later that day, Thomas saw Catlett at a corner store, and heard Catlett say to someone that they \xe2\x80\x9chad to kill her\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cshe spotted someone he was with.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 127\xe2\x80\x93128.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the afternoon of the murder, Carrie Eleby and Linda Jacobs were looking for petitioner Smith, who was Eleby\xe2\x80\x99s boyfriend, near the corner of H and Eighth Streets.  They heard screams coming from where a \xe2\x80\x9cgang of boys\xe2\x80\x9d was beating somebody near the garage in the alley.  <i>Id.,</i> at A539\xe2\x80\x93A541.  Eleby and Jacobs approached the group.  Eleby recognized Christopher Turner, Smith, Catlett, Rouse, Overton, Alston, and Webb kicking Fuller while Yarborough stood nearby.  Both Eleby and Jacobs testified that they saw Rouse sodomize Fuller with a pole.  Eleby added that Overton held Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s legs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the Government played a videotape of a recorded statement that Yarborough, one of the petitioners, had given to detectives on December 9, 1984, approximately two months after the murder.  Names were redacted.  The video shows Yarborough describing in detail how he was part of a large group that forced Fuller into the alley, jointly robbed and assaulted her, and dragged her into the garage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of the defendants testified, nor did any of them try, through witnesses or other evidence, to rebut the prosecution witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 claim that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  Rather, each petitioner pursued what was essentially a \xe2\x80\x9cnot me, maybe them\xe2\x80\x9d defense, namely, that he was not part of the group that attacked Fuller.  Each tried to establish this defense by impeaching witnesses who had placed that particular petitioner at the scene.  Some, for example, provided evidence that Eleby and Jacobs had used PCP the day of Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  Some also tried to establish alibis for the time of Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s death.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury convicted all seven petitioners, along with codefendant Steve Webb (who subsequently died).  The jury acquitted codefendants Alfonso Harris and Felicia Ruffin.  On direct appeal, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions, though it remanded for resentencing.  545 A.\xc2\xa02d 1202, 1219 (1988).  The trial court resentenced petitioners to the same amount of prison time.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931503, at 82a, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>The </i>Brady<i> Claims</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beginning in 2010, petitioners pursued postconviction proceedings in which they sought to vacate their convictions or to be granted a new trial.  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931503, at 84a, n.\xc2\xa04.  After petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions became final, it emerged that the Government possessed certain evidence that it had withheld from the defense at the time of trial.  Petitioners discovered other withheld evidence in their review of the trial prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s case file, which the Government turned over to petitioners in the course of the postconviction proceedings.  Among other postconviction claims, petitioners contended that the withheld evidence was both favorable and material, entitling them to relief under <i>Brady</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The D.\xc2\xa0C. Superior Court considered petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 <i>Brady</i> claims as part of a 16-day evidentiary hearing.  It rejected those claims, finding that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the undisclosed information was material.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 15\xe2\x80\x931503, at 130a.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals affirmed.  116 A. 3d, at 901.  It similarly concluded that the withheld evidence was not material under <i>Brady</i>.  116 A. 3d<i>,</i> at 913\xe2\x80\x93926.  At issue in those proceedings were the following seven specific pieces of evidence:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">1. <i>The identity of James McMillan.</i>  Freeman, the vendor who discovered Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body in the alley garage, testified at trial that, while he was waiting for police to arrive, he saw two men run into the alley and stop near the garage for about five minutes before running away when an officer approached.  One of the men had a bulge under his coat.  Early in the trial, codefendant Harris\xe2\x80\x99 counsel had requested the identity of the two men to confirm that her client was not one of them.  But the Government refused to disclose the men\xe2\x80\x99s identity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In their postconviction review of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s files, petitioners learned that Freeman had identified the two men he saw in the alley as James McMillan and Gerald Merkerson.  McMillan lived in a house which opens in the back onto a connecting alley.  In the weeks following Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s murder, but before petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, McMillan was arrested for beating and robbing two women in the neighborhood.  Neither attack included a sexual assault.  Separately, petitioners learned that seven years after petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, McMillan had robbed, sodomized, and murdered a young woman in an alley.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">2. <i>The interview with Willie Luchie.</i>  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s notes also recorded an undisclosed interview with Willie Luchie, who told the prosecutor that he and three others walked through the alley on their way to an H Street liquor store between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. on the evening of the murder.  As the group walked by the garage, Luchie \xe2\x80\x9cheard several groans\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cremembers the doors to the garage being closed.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 25.  Another person in the group recalled \xe2\x80\x9chear[ing] some moans,\xe2\x80\x9d while the other two persons did not recall hearing anything unusual.  <i>Id.,</i> at 27, 53; <i>id.,</i> at A992.  The group continued walking without looking into the garage or otherwise investigating the source of the sounds.  They did not see McMillan or any other person in the alley when they passed through.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">3. <i>The interviews with Ammie Davis.</i>  Undisclosed notes written by a police officer and the prosecutor refer to two interviews with Ammie Davis, who had been arrested for disorderly conduct a few weeks after Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s murder.  Davis initially told a police investigator that she had seen another individual, James Blue, beat Fuller to death in the alley.  Shortly thereafter, she said she only saw Blue grab Fuller and push her into the alley.  Davis also said that a girlfriend, whom she did not name, accompanied her.  She promised to call the investigator with more details, but she did not do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">About 9 months later (after petitioners were indicted but approximately 11 weeks before their trial), a prosecutor learned of the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s notes and interviewed Davis.  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s notes state that Davis did not provide any more details, except to say that the girlfriend who accompanied her was nicknamed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Shorty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 267\xe2\x80\x93268.  About two months later, which was shortly before petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, Blue murdered Davis in an unrelated drug dispute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">During the postconviction evidentiary hearing, the prosecutor who interviewed Davis testified that he did not disclose Davis\xe2\x80\x99 statement because she acted \xe2\x80\x9cplayful\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnot serious\xe2\x80\x9d during the interview and he found her to be \xe2\x80\x9ctotally incredible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 269\xe2\x80\x93272.  Additionally, the prosecutor stated that he knew Davis had previously falsely accused Blue of a different murder, and on another occasion had falsely accused a different individual of a different murder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">4. <i>Impeachment of Kaye Porter and Carrie Eleby.</i>  Kaye Porter accompanied Eleby during an initial interview with homicide detectives.  Porter agreed with Eleby that she had also heard Alston state that he was involved in robbing Fuller.  An undisclosed prosecutorial note states that in a later interview with detectives, Porter stated that she did not actually recall hearing Alston\xe2\x80\x99s statement and just went along with what Eleby said.  The note also states that Eleby likewise admitted that she had lied about Porter being present during Alston\xe2\x80\x99s statement and had asked Porter to support her.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">5. <i>Impeachment of Carrie Eleby.</i>  A prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s un-disclosed note revealed that Eleby said she had beenhigh on PCP during a January 9, 1985, meeting with investigators.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">6. <i>Impeachment of Linda Jacobs.</i>  An undisclosed note of an interview with Linda Jacobs said that the detective had \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[ed] her hard,\xe2\x80\x9d and that she had \xe2\x80\x9cvacillated\xe2\x80\x9d about what she saw.  <i>Id.,</i> at A1009.

Consistent with these principles, the Government assured the Court at oral argument that subsequent to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, it has adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cgenerous policy of discovery\xe2\x80\x9d in criminal cases under which it discloses any \xe2\x80\x9cinformation that a defendant might wish to use.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.

Having done so, we agree with the lower courts that there was no such reasonable probability.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 main argument is that, had they known about McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s identity and Luchie\xe2\x80\x99s statement, they could have challenged the Government\xe2\x80\x99s basic theory that Fuller was killed in a group attack.  Petitioners contend that they could have raised an alternative theory, namely, that a single perpetrator (or two at most) had attacked Fuller.  According to petitioners, the groans that Luchie and his companion heard when they walked through the alley between 5:30 and 5:45 p.m. suggest that the attack was taking place inside the garage at that moment.  The added facts that the garage was small and that Luchie\xe2\x80\x99s group saw no one in the alley could bolster a \xe2\x80\x9csingle attacker\xe2\x80\x9d theory.  Freeman\xe2\x80\x99s recollection that one garage door was open when he found Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body at around 6 p.m., combined with Luchie\xe2\x80\x99s recollection that both doors were shut around 5:30 or 5:45 p.m., could suggest that one or two perpetrators were in the garage when Luchie walked by but left before Freeman arrived.  McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s identity as one of the men Freeman saw enter the alley after Freeman discovered Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body would have revealed McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s criminal convictions in the months before petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial.  Petitioners argue that together, this evidence would have permitted the defense to knit together a theory that the group attack did not occur at all\xe2\x80\x94and that it was actually McMillan, alone or with an accomplice, who murdered Fuller.  They add that they could have used the investigators\xe2\x80\x99 failure to follow up on Ammie Davis\xe2\x80\x99 claim about James Blue, and the various pieces of withheld impeachment evidence, to suggest that an incomplete investigation had ended up accusing the wrong persons.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Considering the withheld evidence \xe2\x80\x9cin the context of the entire record,\xe2\x80\x9d however, <i>Agurs</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 112, we conclude that it is too little, too weak, or too distant from the main evidentiary points to meet <i>Brady</i>\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  As petitioners recognize, McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s guilt (or that of any other single, or near single, perpetrator) is inconsistent with petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 guilt only if there was no group attack.  But a group attack was the very cornerstone of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The witnesses may have differed on minor details, but virtually every witness to the crime itself agreed as to a main theme: that Fuller was killed by a large group of perpetrators.  The evidence at trial was such that, even though petitioners knew that Freeman saw two men enter the alley after he discovered Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body, that one appeared to have a bulky object hidden under his coat, and that both ran when the police arrived, none of the petitioners attempted to mount a defense that implicated those men as alternative perpetrators acting alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Is it reasonably probable that adding McMillan\xe2\x80\x99s identity, and Luchie\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous statement that he heard groans but saw no one, could have led to a different result at trial?  We conclude that it is not.  The problem for petitioners is that their current alternative theory would have had to persuade the jury that both Alston and Bennett falsely confessed to being active participants in a group attack that never occurred; that Yarborough falsely implicated himself in that group attack and, through coordinated effort or coincidence, gave a highly similar account of how it occurred; that Thomas, a disinterested witness who recognized petitioners when he happened upon the attack and heard Catlett refer to it later that night, wholly fabricated his story; that both Eleby and Jacobs likewise testified to witnessing a group attack that did not occur; and that Montgomery in fact did not see petitioners and others, as a group, identify Fuller as a target and leave the park to rob her.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With respect to the undisclosed impeachment evidence, the record shows that it was largely cumulative of impeachment evidence petitioners already had and used at trial.  For example, the jury heard multiple times about Eleby\xe2\x80\x99s frequent PCP use, including Eleby\xe2\x80\x99s own testimony that she and Jacobs had smoked PCP shortly before they witnessed Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s attack.  In this context, it would not have surprised the jury to learn that Eleby used PCP on yet another occasion.  Porter was a minor witness who was also impeached at trial with evidence about changes in her testimony over time, leaving little added significance to the note that she changed her mind about having agreed with Eleby\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  The jury was also well aware of Jacobs\xe2\x80\x99 vacillation, as she was impeached on the stand with her shifting stories about what she witnessed.  Knowledge that a detective raised his voice during an interview with her would have added little more.  Nor do we see how the note about the statement by Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 aunt could have mattered much, given the facts that neither side chose to call the aunt as a witness and that the jury already knew, from Thomas\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, that his aunt had told him not to tell anyone what he saw.  As for James Blue, petitioners argue that the investigators\xe2\x80\x99 delay in following up on Ammie Davis\xe2\x80\x99 statement could have led the jury to doubt the thoroughness of the investigation.  But this likelihood is seriously undercut by notes about Davis\xe2\x80\x99 demeanor and lack of detail, and by her prior false accusations that Blue committed a different murder and that yet another person committed yet a different murder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We of course do not suggest that impeachment evidence is immaterial with respect to a witness who has already been impeached with other evidence.  See <i>Wearry</i> v. <i>Cain</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2016) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x939).  We conclude only that in the context of this trial, with respect to these witnesses, the cumulative effect of the withheld evidence is insufficient to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undermine confidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict, <i>Smith,</i> 565 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75\xe2\x80\x9376 (quoting <i>Kyles</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 434; brackets omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On the basis of our review of the record, we agree with the lower courts that there is not a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that the withheld evidence would have changed the outcome of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 trial, <i>id.,</i> at 434 (internal quotation marks omitted).

In the first, the government accuses ten defendants of acting together to commit a vicious murder and robbery.  At trial, each defendant accepts that the attack occurred almost exactly as the government describes\xe2\x80\x94contending only that <i>he</i> wasn\xe2\x80\x99t part of the rampaging group.  The defendants thus undermine each other\xe2\x80\x99s arguments at every turn.  In the second case, the government makes the same arguments as before.  But this time, all of the accused adopt a common defense, built around an alternative account of the crime.  Armed with new evidence that someone else perpetrated the murder, the defendants vigorously dispute the government\xe2\x80\x99s gang-attack narrative and challenge the credibility of its investigation.  The question this case presents is whether such a unified defense, relying on evidence unavailable in the first scenario, had a \xe2\x80\x9creason-able probability\xe2\x80\x9d (less than a preponderance) of shiftingeven one juror\xe2\x80\x99s vote.  <i>Cone</i> v. <i>Bell</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449,\n452,\n470 (2009)\n; see <i>Kyles </i>v. <i>Whitley</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419,\n434 (1995)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is the relevant question because the Government here knew about but withheld the evidence of an alternative perpetrator\xe2\x80\x94and so prevented the defendants from coming together to press that theory of the case.  If the Government\xe2\x80\x99s non-disclosure was material, in the sense just described, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Brady</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n, demands a new trial.  The Court today holds it was not material: In light of the evidence the Government offered, the majority argues, the transformed defense stood little chance of persuading a juror to vote to acquit.  That conclusion is not indefensible: The Government put on quite a few witnesses who said that the defendants committed the crime.  But in the end, I think the majority gets the answer in this case wrong.  With the undisclosed evidence, the whole tenor of the trial would have changed.  Rather than relying on a \xe2\x80\x9cnot me, maybe them\xe2\x80\x9d defense, <i>ante,</i> at 6, all the defendants would have relentlessly impeached the Government\xe2\x80\x99s (thoroughly impeachable) witnesses and offered the jurors a way to view the crime in a different light.  In my view, that could well have flipped one or more jurors\xe2\x80\x94which is all <i>Brady </i>requires.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Before explaining that view, I note that the majority and I share some common ground.  We agree on the universe of exculpatory or impeaching evidence suppressed in this case: The majority\xe2\x80\x99s description of that evidence, and of the trial held without it, is scrupulously fair.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x936, 7\xe2\x80\x939.  We also agree\xe2\x80\x94as does the Government\xe2\x80\x94that such evidence ought to be disclosed to defendants as a matter of course.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10.  Constitutional requirements aside, turning over exculpatory materials is a core responsibility of all prosecutors\xe2\x80\x94whose professional interest and obligation is not to win cases but to ensure justice is done.  See <i>Kyles</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 439. <i> </i>And finally, we agree on the legal standard by which to assess the materiality of undisclosed evidence for purposes of applying the constitutional rule: Courts are to ask whether there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that disclosure of the evidence would have led to a different outcome\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> an acquittal or hung jury rather than a conviction.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But I part ways with the majority in applying that standard to the evidence withheld in this case.  That evidence falls into three basic categories, discussed below.  Taken together, the materials would have recast the trial significantly\xe2\x80\x94so much so as to \xe2\x80\x9cundermine[\xc2\xa0] confidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the guilty verdicts reached in their absence.  <i>Kyles</i>, 514 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 434.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, the Government suppressed information identifying a possible alternative perpetrator.  The defendants knew that, shortly before the police arrived, witnesses had observed two men acting suspiciously near the alleyway garage where Catherine Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s body was found.  But they did not know\xe2\x80\x94because the Government never told them\xe2\x80\x94that a witness had identified one of those men as James McMillan.  Equipped with that information, the defendants would have discovered that in the weeks following Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s murder, McMillan assaulted and robbed two other women of comparable age in the same neighborhood.  And using <i>that</i> information, the defendants would have united around a common defense.  They would all have pointed their fingers at McMillan (rather than at each other), arguing that he committed Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s murder as part of a string of similar crimes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Government suppressed witness statements suggesting that one or two perpetrators\xe2\x80\x94not a large group\xe2\x80\x94carried out the attack.  Those statements were given by two individuals who walked past the garage around the time of Fuller\xe2\x80\x99s death.  They told the police that they heard groans coming from inside the garage; and one remarked that the garage\xe2\x80\x99s doors were closed at the time.  Introducing that evidence at trial would have sown doubt about the Government\xe2\x80\x99s group-attack narrative, because that many people (as everyone agrees) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have fit inside the small garage.  And the questions thus raised would have further supported the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 theory that McMillan (and perhaps an accomplice) had committed the murder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third and finally, the Government suppressed a raft of evidence discrediting its investigation and impeaching its witnesses.  Undisclosed files, for example, showed that the police took more than nine months to look into a witness\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a man named James Blue had murdered Fuller.  Evidence of that kind of negligence could easily have led jurors to wonder about the competence of all the police work done in the case.  Other withheld documents revealed that one of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s main witnesses was high on PCP when she met with investigators to identify participants in the crime\xe2\x80\x94and that she also encouraged a friend to lie to the police to support her story.  Using that sort of information, see also <i>ante,</i> at 9, the defendants could have undercut the Government\xe2\x80\x99s witnesses\xe2\x80\x94even while presenting their own account of the murder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In reply to all this, the majority argues that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the [accused] attempted to mount [an alternative-perpetrator] defense\xe2\x80\x9d and that such a defense would have challenged \xe2\x80\x9cthe very cornerstone of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 12.  But that just proves my point.  The defendants didn\xe2\x80\x99t offer an alternative-perpetrator defense because the Government prevented them from learning what made it credible: that one of the men seen near the garage had a record of assaulting and robbing middle-aged women, and that witnesses would back up the theory that only one or two individuals had committed the murder.  Moreover, that defense had game-changing potential exactly <i>because</i> it challenged the cornerstone of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Without the withheld evidence, each of the defendants had little choice but to accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s framing of the crime as a group attack\xe2\x80\x94and argue only that <i>he </i>wasn\xe2\x80\x99t there.  That meant the defendants often worked at cross-purposes.  In particular, each defendant not identified by a Government witness sought to bolster that witness\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, no matter the harm to his co-defendants.  As one defense lawyer remarked after another\xe2\x80\x99s supposed cross-examination of a Government witness: \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve got [an extra] prosecutor[\xc2\xa0] in the courtroom now.\xe2\x80\x9d  Saperstein &amp; Walsh, 10 Defendants Complicate Trial, Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1985, p. A14, col. 1.  Credible alternative-perpetrator evidence would have allowed the defendants to escape this cycle of mutually assured destruction.  By enabling the defendants to jointly attack the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccornerstone\xe2\x80\x9d theory, the withheld evidence would have reframed the case presented to the jury.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Still, the majority claims, an alternative-perpetrator defense would have had no realistic chance of changing the outcome because the Government had ample evidence of a group attack, including five witnesses who testified that they had participated in it or seen it happen.  See <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case wasn\xe2\x80\x99t nearly the slam-dunk the majority suggests.  No physical evidence tied any of the defendants to the crime\xe2\x80\x94a highly surprising fact if, as the Government claimed, more than ten people carried out a spur-of-the-moment, rampage-like attack in a confined space.  And as even the majority recognizes, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s five eyewitnesses had some serious credibility deficits.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Two had been charged as defendants, and agreed to testify only in exchange for favorable plea deals.  See 116 A.\xc2\xa03d 894, 902 (D.\xc2\xa0C. 2015).<b> </b>Two admitted they were high on PCP at the time.  See <i>id.,</i> at 903, 911; App. A535\xe2\x80\x93A536, A649.<b> </b>(As noted above, one was also high when she later met with police to identify the culprits.)  One was an eighth-grader whose own aunt contradicted parts of his trial testimony.  See 116 A.\xc2\xa03d, at 903, 911.  Even in the absence of an alternative account of the crime, the jury took more than a week\xe2\x80\x94and many dozens of votes\xe2\x80\x94to reach its final verdict.  Had the defendants offered a unified counter-narrative, based on the withheld evidence, one or more jurors could well have concluded that the Government had not proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Again, the issue here concerns the difference between two criminal cases.  The Government got the case it most wanted\xe2\x80\x94the one in which the defendants, each in an effort to save himself, formed something of a circular firing squad.  And the Government avoided the case it most feared\xe2\x80\x94the one in which the defendants acted jointly to show that a man known to assault women like Fuller committed her murder.  The difference between the two cases lay in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s files\xe2\x80\x94evidence of obvious relevance that prosecutors nonetheless chose to suppress.  I think it could have mattered to the trial\xe2\x80\x99s outcome.  For that reason, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
