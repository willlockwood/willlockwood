Petitioner was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question suggested that he was guilty.

There were no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a dark-colored car.  Police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene.  The investigation led police to petitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed.  Police visited petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway.  He agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interview with the police lasted approximately one hour.  All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read Miranda warnings.  See Mi- randa v. Arizona, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966)\n.  For most of the interview, petitioner answered the officer\xe2\x80\x99s questions.  But when asked whether his shotgun \xe2\x80\x9cwould match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 17, petitioner declined to answer.  Instead, petitioner \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at  18.  After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFollowing the interview, police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants.  Prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders, and he was released.  A few days later, police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings.  On the strength of that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti- tioner, but by this time he had absconded.  In 2007, police discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an assumed name.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner did not testify at trial.  Over his objection, prosecutors used his reaction to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question dur- ing the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt.  The jury found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence.  On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the \n \nFifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prearrest, pre-Miranda silence was not \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the \n \nFifth Amendment.  368 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 550, 557\xe2\x80\x93559 (2011).  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and affirmed on the same ground.  369 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 176 (2012).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), to resolve a division of authority in the lower courts over whether the prosecution may use a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial police interview as part of its case in chief.  Compare, e.g., United States v. Rivera, 944 F.\xc2\xa02d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991), with United States v. Moore, 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 377, 386 (CADC 1997).  But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege during his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe privilege against self-incrimination \xe2\x80\x9cis an exception to the general principle that the Government has the right to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648\n, n.\xc2\xa011 (1976).  To prevent the privilege from shielding information not properly within its scope, we have long held that a witness who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98desires the protection of the privilege .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must claim it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d at the time he relies on it.  Murphy, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427 (quoting Monia, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427).  See also United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, \n\n273 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, \n113 (1927)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat requirement ensures that the Government is put on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-incriminating, see Hoffman v. United States, \n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479, \n486 (1951)\n, or cure any potential self-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see Kastigar v. United States, \n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 441, \n448 (1972)\n.  The express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with evaluating a \n \nFifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous record establishing the witness\xe2\x80\x99 reasons for refusing to answer.  See Roberts v. United States, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cA witness may not employ the privilege to avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not to give\xe2\x80\x9d); Hutcheson v. United States, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 599\n\xe2\x80\x93611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as proper assertion of the privilege).  In these ways, insisting that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cassures that the Government obtains all the information to which it is entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner, supra, at 658, n.\xc2\xa011.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have previously recognized two exceptions to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but neither applies here.  First, we held in Griffin v. California, \n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609\n\xe2\x80\x93615 (1965), that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.  That exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute right not to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  Turner v. United States, \n\n396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398, \n433 (1970)\n (Black, J., dissenting); see United States v. Patane, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, \n637 (2004)\n (plurality opinion).  Since a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke the privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing that his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a grant of immunity could force him to speak.  Because pe- titioner had no comparable unqualified right during his interview with police, his silence falls outside the Griffin exception.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, we have held that a witness\xe2\x80\x99 failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.  Thus, in Miranda, we said that a suspect who is subjected to the \xe2\x80\x9cinherently compelling pressures\xe2\x80\x9d of an unwarned custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege.  384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467\xe2\x80\x93468, and n.\xc2\xa037.  Due to the uniquely coercive nature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody cannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cunless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Murphy, supra, at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor similar reasons, we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it need not be affirmatively asserted.  Garrity v. New Jersey, \n\n385 U. S. 493, \n497 (1967)\n (public employment).  See also Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, \n\n431 U. S. 801\n\xe2\x80\x93804 (1977) (public office); Lefkowitz v. Turley, \n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70\n\xe2\x80\x9385 (1973) (public contracts).  And where assertion of the privilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence.  See, e.g., Leary v. United States, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6\n\xe2\x80\x9329 (1969) (no requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing so would have revealed income from illegal activities); Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., \n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70\n\xe2\x80\x9379 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not required to complete registration form \xe2\x80\x9cwhere response to any of the form\xe2\x80\x99s questions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might involve [them] in the admission of a crucial element of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  The principle that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official compulsion denies him \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Garner, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (quoting Lisenba v. California, \n\n314 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219, \n241 (1941)\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary.  As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and \xe2\x80\x9cwas free to leave at any time during the interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 2\xe2\x80\x933 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That places petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s situation outside the scope of Miranda and other cases in which we have held that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege.  The dissent elides this point when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the \n \nFifth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The critical question is whether, under the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances\xe2\x80\x9d of this case, petitioner was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the \n \nFifth Amendment.  He was not.  We have before us no allegation that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to assert the privilege was involuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to say that he was not answering the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question on \n \nFifth Amendment grounds.  Because he failed to do so, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of his noncustodial silence did not violate the \n \nFifth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in- vocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands mute and thereby declines to give an answer that of- ficials suspect would be incriminating.  Our cases all but foreclose such an exception, which would needlessly burden the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in obtaining testimony and prosecuting criminal activity.  We therefore decline petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to craft a new exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that a witness must assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.  Murphy, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur cases establish that a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.  In Roberts v. United States, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552\n, for example, we rejected the \n \nFifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained silent throughout a police investigation and received a harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate.  In so ruling, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif [the defendant] believed that his failure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 560.  See also United States v. Sullivan, \n\n274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259\n\xe2\x80\x93264 (1927); Vajtauer, 273 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 113.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  A witness does not expressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incrim- inate the witness.  Thus, in Murphy we held that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-incriminating answers to his probation of- ficer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to invoke the privilege.  465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427\xe2\x80\x93428.  In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the notion \xe2\x80\x9cthat a witness must \xe2\x80\x98put the Government on notice by formally availing himself of the privilege\xe2\x80\x99 only when he alone \xe2\x80\x98is reasonably aware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 428 (quoting Roberts, supra, at 562, n.* (Brennan, J., concurring)).

Thus, petitioner would have us hold that although neither a wit- ness\xe2\x80\x99 silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse the express invocation requirement, the invocation requirement does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of official suspicions.  For the same reasons that neither of those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we conclude that they do not do so together.  A contrary result would do little to protect those genuinely relying on the \n \nFifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new burden on society\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the admission of evidence that is probative of a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed exception would also be very difficult to reconcile with Berghuis v. Thompkins, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370 (2010)\n.  There, we held in the closely related context of post-Miranda silence that a defendant failed to invoke the privilege when he refused to respond to police questioning for 2 hours and 45 minutes.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3, 8\xe2\x80\x9310).  If the extended custodial silence in that case did not invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary silence in this case did not do so either.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish Berg- huis by observing that it did not concern the admissi- bility of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence but instead involved the admissibility of his subsequent statements.  Post, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  But regardless of whether prosecutors seek to use silence or a confession that follows, the logic of Berghuis applies with equal force: A suspect who stands mute has not done enough to put police on notice that he is relying on his \n \nFifth Amendment privilege.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn support of their proposed exception to the invocation requirement, petitioner and the dissent argue that reliance on the \n \nFifth Amendment privilege is the most likely explanation for silence in a case such as this one.  Reply Brief 17; see post, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  But whatever the most probable explanation, such silence is \xe2\x80\x9cinsolubly ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Doyle, v. Ohio, \n\n426 U.\xc2\xa0S. 610, \n617 (1976)\n.  To be sure, someone might decline to answer a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s question in reliance on his constitutional privilege.  But he also might do so because he is trying to think of a good lie, because he is embarrassed, or because he is protecting someone else.

But petitioner balked when the officer asked whether a ballistics test would show that the shell casings found at the crime scene would match petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s shotgun.  Petitioner was subsequently charged with murder, and at trial prosecutors argued that his reaction to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question suggested that he was guilty.

It has long been settled that the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally is not self-executing\xe2\x80\x9d and that a witness who desires its protection \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98must claim it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Minnesota</i> v. <i>Murphy</i>,465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420, 425, 427 (1984) (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Monia</i>, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 424, 427 (1943)).  Although \xe2\x80\x9cno ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Quinn</i> v. <i>United States</i>,349 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155, 164 (1955), a witness does not do so by simply standing mute.  Because petitioner was required to assert the privilege in order to benefit from it, the judgment of the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Fifth Amendment claim is affirmed.</p><p>I</p><p>On the morning of December 18, 1992, two brothers were shot and killed in their Houston home.  There were no witnesses to the murders, but a neighbor who heard gunshots saw someone run out of the house and speed away in a dark-colored car.  Police recovered six shotgun shell casings at the scene.  The investigation led police to petitioner, who had been a guest at a party the victims hosted the night before they were killed.  Police visited petitioner at his home, where they saw a dark blue car in the driveway.  He agreed to hand over his shotgun for ballistics testing and to accompany police to the station for questioning.</p><p>Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s interview with the police lasted approximately one hour.  All agree that the interview was noncustodial, and the parties litigated this case on the assumption that he was not read <i>Miranda</i> warnings.  See <i>Mi</i>-<i> randa</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966).  For most of the interview, petitioner answered the officer\xe2\x80\x99s questions.  But when asked whether his shotgun \xe2\x80\x9cwould match the shells recovered at the scene of the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 17, petitioner declined to answer.  Instead, petitioner \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ooked down at the floor, shuffled his feet, bit his bottom lip, cl[e]nched his hands in his lap, [and] began to tighten up.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at  18.  After a few moments of silence, the officer asked additional questions, which petitioner answered.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>Following the interview, police arrested petitioner on outstanding traffic warrants.  Prosecutors soon concluded that there was insufficient evidence to charge him with the murders, and he was released.  A few days later, police obtained a statement from a man who said he had heard petitioner confess to the killings.  On the strength of that additional evidence, prosecutors decided to charge peti- tioner, but by this time he had absconded.  In 2007, police discovered petitioner living in the Houston area under an assumed name.</p><p>Petitioner did not testify at trial.  Over his objection, prosecutors used his reaction to the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question dur- ing the 1993 interview as evidence of his guilt.  The jury found petitioner guilty, and he received a 20-year sentence.  On direct appeal to the Court of Appeals of Texas, petitioner argued that prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 use of his silence as part of their case in chief violated the Fifth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals rejected that argument, reasoning that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s prearrest, pre-<i>Miranda</i> silence was not \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.  368 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 550, 557\xe2\x80\x93559 (2011).  The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals took up this case and affirmed on the same ground.  369 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 176 (2012).</p><p>We granted certiorari, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), to resolve a division of authority in the lower courts over whether the prosecution may use a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination during a noncustodial police interview as part of its case in chief.  Compare, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Rivera</i>, 944 F.\xc2\xa02d 1563, 1568 (CA11 1991), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Moore</i>, 104 F.\xc2\xa03d 377, 386 (CADC 1997).  But because petitioner did not invoke the privilege during his interview, we find it unnecessary to reach that question.</p><p>II</p><p>A</p><p>The privilege against self-incrimination \xe2\x80\x9cis an exception to the general principle that the Government has the right to everyone\xe2\x80\x99s testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Garner</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>,424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648, 658, n.\xc2\xa011 (1976).  To prevent the privilege from shielding information not properly within its scope, we have long held that a witness who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98desires the protection of the privilege .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must claim it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d at the time he relies on it.  <i>Murphy</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427 (quoting <i>Monia</i>, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427).  See also <i>United States</i> <i>ex\xc2\xa0rel. Vajtauer </i>v.<i> Commissioner of Immigration</i>,273 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, 113 (1927).</p><p>That requirement ensures that the Government is put on notice when a witness intends to rely on the privilege so that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-incriminating, see <i>Hoffman</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>,341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479, 486 (1951), or cure any potential self-incrimination through a grant of immunity, see <i>Kastigar</i> v. <i>United States</i>,406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 441, 448 (1972).  The express invocation requirement also gives courts tasked with evaluating a Fifth Amendment claim a contemporaneous record establishing the witness\xe2\x80\x99 reasons for refusing to answer.  See <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>United States</i>,445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552, 560, n.\xc2\xa07 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cA witness may not employ the privilege to avoid giving testimony that he simply would prefer not to give\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Hutcheson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 599, 610\xe2\x80\x93611 (1962) (declining to treat invocation of due process as proper assertion of the privilege).  In these ways, insisting that witnesses expressly invoke the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cassures that the Government obtains all the information to which it is entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Garner</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 658, n.\xc2\xa011.</p><p>We have previously recognized two exceptions to the requirement that witnesses invoke the privilege, but neither applies here.  First, we held in <i>Griffin</i> v. <i>California</i>,380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609, 613\xe2\x80\x93615 (1965), that a criminal defendant need not take the stand and assert the privilege at his own trial.  That exception reflects the fact that a criminal defendant has an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute right not to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner</i> v. <i>United States</i>,396 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398, 433 (1970) (Black, J., dissenting); see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Patane</i>,542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, 637 (2004) (plurality opinion).  Since a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s reasons for remaining silent at trial are irrelevant to his constitutional right to do so, requiring that he expressly invoke the privilege would serve no purpose; neither a showing that his testimony would not be self-incriminating nor a grant of immunity could force him to speak.  Because pe- titioner had no comparable unqualified right during his interview with police, his silence falls outside the <i>Griffin</i> exception.</p><p>Second, we have held that a witness\xe2\x80\x99 failure to invoke the privilege must be excused where governmental coercion makes his forfeiture of the privilege involuntary.  Thus, in <i>Miranda</i>, we said that a suspect who is subjected to the \xe2\x80\x9cinherently compelling pressures\xe2\x80\x9d of an unwarned custodial interrogation need not invoke the privilege.  384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467\xe2\x80\x93468, and n.\xc2\xa037.  Due to the uniquely coercive nature of custodial interrogation, a suspect in custody cannot be said to have voluntarily forgone the privilege \xe2\x80\x9cunless [he] fails to claim [it] after being suitably warned.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Murphy</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.</p><p>For similar reasons, we have held that threats to withdraw a governmental benefit such as public employment sometimes make exercise of the privilege so costly that it need not be affirmatively asserted.  <i>Garrity</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,385 U. S. 493, 497 (1967) (public employment).  See also <i>Lefkowitz</i> v. <i>Cunningham</i>,431 U. S. 801, 802\xe2\x80\x93804 (1977) (public office); <i>Lefkowitz</i> v. <i>Turley</i>,414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70, 84\xe2\x80\x9385 (1973) (public contracts).  And where assertion of the privilege would itself tend to incriminate, we have allowed witnesses to exercise the privilege through silence.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Leary</i> v. <i>United States</i>,395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6, 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (1969) (no requirement that taxpayer complete tax form where doing so would have revealed income from illegal activities); <i>Albertson</i> v. <i>Subversive Activities Control Bd.</i>,382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70, 77\xe2\x80\x9379 (1965) (members of the Communist Party not required to complete registration form \xe2\x80\x9cwhere response to any of the form\xe2\x80\x99s questions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. might involve [them] in the admission of a crucial element of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  The principle that unites all of those cases is that a witness need not expressly invoke the privilege where some form of official compulsion denies him \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98free choice to admit, to deny, or to refuse to answer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Garner</i>, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 656\xe2\x80\x93657 (quoting <i>Lisenba</i> v. <i>California</i>,314 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219, 241 (1941)).</p><p>Petitioner cannot benefit from that principle because it is undisputed that his interview with police was voluntary.  As petitioner himself acknowledges, he agreed to accompany the officers to the station and \xe2\x80\x9cwas free to leave at any time during the interview.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 2\xe2\x80\x933 (internal quotation marks omitted).  That places petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s situation outside the scope of <i>Miranda</i> and other cases in which we have held that various forms of governmental coercion prevented defendants from voluntarily invoking the privilege.  The dissent elides this point when it cites our precedents in this area for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ircumstances, rather than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the Fifth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The critical question is whether, under the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances\xe2\x80\x9d of this case, petitioner was deprived of the ability to voluntarily invoke the Fifth Amendment.  He was not.  We have before us no allegation that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to assert the privilege was involuntary, and it would have been a simple matter for him to say that he was not answering the officer\xe2\x80\x99s question on Fifth Amendment grounds.  Because he failed to do so, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s use of his noncustodial silence did not violate the Fifth Amendment.</p><p>B</p><p>Petitioner urges us to adopt a third exception to the in- vocation requirement for cases in which a witness stands mute and thereby declines to give an answer that of- ficials suspect would be incriminating.  Our cases all but foreclose such an exception, which would needlessly burden the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in obtaining testimony and prosecuting criminal activity.  We therefore decline petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to craft a new exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule\xe2\x80\x9d that a witness must assert the privilege to subsequently benefit from it.  <i>Murphy</i>, 465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429.</p><p>Our cases establish that a defendant normally does not invoke the privilege by remaining silent.  In <i>Roberts</i> v. <i>United</i> <i>States</i>,445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552, for example, we rejected the Fifth Amendment claim of a defendant who remained silent throughout a police investigation and received a harsher sentence for his failure to cooperate.  In so ruling, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cif [the defendant] believed that his failure to cooperate was privileged, he should have said so at a time when the sentencing court could have determined whether his claim was legitimate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 560.  See also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Sullivan</i>,274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259, 263\xe2\x80\x93264 (1927); <i>Vajtauer</i>, 273 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 113.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  A witness does not expressly invoke the privilege by standing mute.</p><p>We have also repeatedly held that the express invocation requirement applies even when an official has reason to suspect that the answer to his question would incrim- inate the witness.  Thus, in <i>Murphy</i> we held that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-incriminating answers to his probation of- ficer were properly admitted at trial because he failed to invoke the privilege.  465 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 427\xe2\x80\x93428.  In reaching that conclusion, we rejected the notion \xe2\x80\x9cthat a witness must \xe2\x80\x98put the Government on notice by formally availing himself of the privilege\xe2\x80\x99 only when he alone \xe2\x80\x98is reasonably aware of the incriminating tendency of the questions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 428 (quoting <i>Roberts</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 562, n.* (Brennan, J., concurring)).

Thus, petitioner would have us hold that although neither a wit- ness\xe2\x80\x99 silence nor official suspicions are enough to excuse the express invocation requirement, the invocation requirement does not apply where a witness is silent in the face of official suspicions.  For the same reasons that neither of those factors is sufficient by itself to relieve a witness of the obligation to expressly invoke the privilege, we conclude that they do not do so together.  A contrary result would do little to protect those genuinely relying on the Fifth Amendment privilege while placing a needless new burden on society\xe2\x80\x99s interest in the admission of evidence that is probative of a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.</p><p>Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed exception would also be very difficult to reconcile with <i>Berghuis</i> v. <i>Thompkins</i>,560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370 (2010).

If the extended custodial silence in that case did not invoke the privilege, then surely the momentary silence in this case did not do so either.</p><p>Petitioner and the dissent attempt to distinguish <i>Berg</i>-<i> huis</i> by observing that it did not concern the admissi- bility of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence but instead involved the admissibility of his subsequent statements.  <i>Post,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (opinion of Breyer, J.).

Not every such possible explanation for silence is probative of guilt, but neither is every possible explanation protected by the Fifth Amendment.

To permit a prosecutor to comment on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionally protected silence would put that defendant in an impossible predicament.

See, e.g., Griffin, supra, at 613; Kassin, Inside Interrogation: Why Innocent People Confess, 32 Am. J. Trial Advoc. 525, 537 (2009).  If he remains silent, the prosecutor may well use that silence to suggest a consciousness of guilt.  And if the defendant then takes the witness stand in order to explain either his speech or his silence, the prosecution may introduce, say for impeachment purposes, a prior conviction that the law would otherwise make inadmissible.  Thus, where the \n \nFifth Amendment is at issue, to allow comment on silence directly or indirectly can compel an individual to act as \xe2\x80\x9ca witness against himself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94very much what the \n \nFifth Amendment forbids.  Cf. Pennsylvania v. Muniz, \n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 582\n\xe2\x80\x93597 (1990) (definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d includes responses to questions that require a suspect to communicate an express or implied assertion of fact or belief).  And that is similarly so whether the questioned individual, as part of his decision to remain silent, invokes the \n \nFifth Amendment explicitly or implic- itly, through words, through deeds, or through reference to surrounding circumstances.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is consequently not surprising that this Court, more than half a century ago, explained that \xe2\x80\x9cno ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Quinn v. United States, \n\n349 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155, \n164 (1955)\n.    Thus, a prosecutor may not comment on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to testify at trial\xe2\x80\x94even if neither the defendant nor anyone else ever mentions a \n \nFifth Amendment right not to do so.  Circumstances, not a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statement, tie the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence to the right.  Similarly, a prosecutor may not comment on the fact that a defendant in custody, after receiving Miranda warnings, \xe2\x80\x9cstood mute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94regardless of whether he \xe2\x80\x9cclaimed his privilege\xe2\x80\x9d in so many words.  Miranda, supra, at 468, n. 37.  Again, it is not any explicit statement but, instead, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s deeds (silence) and circumstances (receipt of the warnings) that tie together silence and constitutional right.  Most lower courts have so construed the law, even where the defendant, having received Miranda warnings, answers some questions while remaining silent as to others.  See, e.g., Hurd v. Terhune, 619 F.\xc2\xa03d 1080, 1087 (CA9 2010); United States v. May, 52 F.\xc2\xa03d 885, 890 (CA10 1995); United States v. Scott, 47 F.\xc2\xa03d 904, 907 (CA7 1995); United States v. Canterbury, 985 F.\xc2\xa02d 483, 486 (CA10 1993); Grieco v. Hall, 641 F.\xc2\xa02d 1029, 1034 (CA1 1981); United States v. Ghiz, 491 F.\xc2\xa02d 599, 600 (CA4 1974).  But see, e.g., United States v. Harris, 956 F.\xc2\xa02d 177, 181 (CA8 1992).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe cases in which this Court has insisted that a defendant expressly mention the \n \nFifth Amendment by name in order to rely on its privilege to protect silence are cases where (1) the circumstances surrounding the silence (unlike the present case) did not give rise to an inference that the defendant intended, by his silence, to exercise his \n \nFifth Amendment rights; and (2) the questioner greeted by the silence (again unlike the present case) had a special need to know whether the defendant sought to rely on the protections of the \n \nFifth Amendment.  See ante, at 4 (explaining that, in such cases, the government needs to know the basis for refusing to answer \xe2\x80\x9cso that it may either argue that the testimony sought could not be self-incriminating or cure any potential self-incrimination through a grant of immunity\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  These cases include Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, Vajtauer, and Jenkins\xe2\x80\x94all of which at least do involve the protection of silence\xe2\x80\x94and also include cases emphasized by the plural- ity that are not even about silence\xe2\x80\x94namely, Murphy and Garner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Roberts and Rogers, the individual refused to answer questions that government investigators (in Roberts) and a grand jury (in Rogers) asked, principally because the individual wanted to avoid incriminating other persons.  Roberts v. United States, \n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552\n\xe2\x80\x93556 (1980); Rogers v. United States, \n\n340 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367\n\xe2\x80\x93370, and n.\xc2\xa04 (1951).  But the \n \nFifth Amendment does not protect someone from incriminating others; it protects against self-incrimination.  In turn, neither the nature of the questions nor the circumstances of the refusal to answer them provided any basis to infer a tie between the silence and the \n \nFifth Amendment, while knowledge of any such tie would have proved critical to the questioner\xe2\x80\x99s determination as to whether the defendant had any proper legal basis for claiming \n \nFifth Amendment protection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Sullivan, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence consisted of his failure to file a tax return\xe2\x80\x94a return, he later claimed, that would have revealed his illegal activity as a bootlegger.  United States v. Sullivan, \n\n274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259\n\xe2\x80\x93264 (1927).  The circumstances did not give rise to an inference of a tie between his silence (in the form of failing to file a tax return) and the \n \nFifth Amendment; and, if he really did want to rely on the \n \nFifth Amendment, then the government would have had special need to know of any such tie in order to determine whether, for example, the assertion of privilege was valid and, perhaps, an offer of immunity was appropriate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Vajtauer, an alien refused to answer questions asked by an immigration official at a deportation proceeding.  United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration, \n\n273 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, \n113 (1927)\n.  Here, the circumstances gave rise to a distinct inference that the alien was not invoking any \n \nFifth Amendment privilege: The alien\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer had stated quite publicly at the hearing that he advised his client to remain silent not on \n \nFifth Amendment grounds; rather, the lawyer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98advise[d] the alien not to answer any further questions until the evidence upon which the warrant is based will be presented here.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 106\xe2\x80\x93107 (quoting the lawyer).  This statement weakened or destroyed the possibility of a silence-\n \nFifth Amendment linkage; the Government could not challenge his right to invoke the \n \nFifth Amendment; and this Court described its later invocation as \xe2\x80\x9cevidently an afterthought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 113.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPerhaps most illustrative is Jenkins, a case upon which the plurality relies, ante, at 9, n. 3, and upon which the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals relied almost exclusively, 369 S. W. 3d 176, 178\xe2\x80\x93179 (2012).  Jenkins killed someone, and was not arrested until he turned himself in two weeks later.  Jenkins v. Anderson, \n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 231, \n232 (1980)\n.  On cross-examination at his trial, Jenkins claimed that his killing was in self-defense after being attacked.  Id., at 232\xe2\x80\x93233.  The prosecutor then asked why he did not report the alleged attack, and in closing argument suggested that Jenkins\xe2\x80\x99 failure to do so cast doubt on his claim to have acted in self-defense.  Id., at 233\xe2\x80\x93234.  We explained that this unusual form of \xe2\x80\x9cprearrest silence\xe2\x80\x9d was not constitutionally protected from use at trial.  Id., at 240.  Perhaps even more aptly, Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 concurrence noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is simply irrelevant\xe2\x80\x9d in such circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 241 (footnote omitted).  How would anyone have known that Jenkins, while failing to report an attack, was relying on the \n \nFifth Amendment?  And how would the government have had any way of determining whether his claim was valid?  In Jenkins, as in Roberts, Rogers, Sullivan, and Vajtauer, no one had any reason to connect silence to the \n \nFifth Amendment; and the government had no opportunity to contest any alleged connection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill further afield from today\xe2\x80\x99s case are Murphy and Garner, neither of which involved silence at all.  Rather, in both cases, a defendant had earlier answered questions posed by the government\xe2\x80\x94in Murphy, by speaking with a probation officer, and in Garner, by completing a tax return.  Minnesota v. Murphy, \n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420\n\xe2\x80\x93425 (1984); Garner v. United States, \n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 648\n\xe2\x80\x93650 (1976).  At the time of providing answers, neither circumstances nor deeds nor words suggested reliance on the \n \nFifth Amendment: Murphy simply answered questions posed by his probation officer; Garner simply filled out a tax return.  They did not argue that their self-incriminating statements had been \xe2\x80\x9ccompelled\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the \n \nFifth Amendment until later, at trial.  Murphy, supra, at 425, 431; Garner, supra, at 649, 665.  The Court held that those statements were not compelled.  Murphy, supra, at 440; Garner, supra, at 665.  The circumstances indicated that the defendants had affirmatively chosen to speak and to write.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThus, we have two sets of cases: One where express invocation of the \n \nFifth Amendment was not required to tie one\xe2\x80\x99s silence to its protections, and another where something like express invocation was required, because circumstances demanded some explanation for the silence  (or the statements) in order to indicate that the \n \nFifth Amendment was at issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is also a third set of cases, cases that may well fit into the second category but where the Court has held that the \n \nFifth Amendment both applies and does not require express invocation despite ambiguous circumstances.  The Court in those cases has made clear that an individual, when silent, need not expressly invoke the \n \nFifth Amendment if there are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently compelling pressures\xe2\x80\x9d not to do so.  Miranda, 384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 467.  Thus, in Garrity v. New Jersey, \n\n385 U.\xc2\xa0S. 493, \n497 (1967)\n, the Court held that no explicit assertion of the \n \nFifth Amendment was required where, in the course of an investigation, such assertion would, by law, have cost police officers their jobs.  Similarly, this Court did not require explicit assertion in response  to a grand jury subpoena where that assertion would have cost two architects their public contracts or a political official his job.   Lefkowitz v. Turley, \n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70\n\xe2\x80\x9376 (1973); Lefkowitz v. Cunningham, \n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 801\n\xe2\x80\x93804 (1977).  In Leary v. United States, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6\n\xe2\x80\x9329 (1969), the Court held that the \n \nFifth Amendment did not require explicit assertion of the privilege against self-incrimination because, in the context of the Marihuana Tax Act, such assertion would have been inherently incriminating.  In Albertson v. Subversive Activities Control Bd., \n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70\n\xe2\x80\x9379 (1965), we held the same where explicit assertion of the \n \nFifth Amendment would have required, as a first step, the potentially incriminating admission of membership in the Communist Party.  The Court has also held that gamblers, without explicitly invoking the \n \nFifth Amendment, need not comply with tax requirements that would, inherently and directly, lead to self-incrimination.  Marchetti v. United States, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 39\n\xe2\x80\x9361 (1968); Grosso v. United States, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 62\n\xe2\x80\x9368 (1968).  All told, this third category of cases receives the same treatment as the first: Circumstances, rather than explicit invocation, trigger the protection of the \n \nFifth Amendment.  So, too, in today\xe2\x80\x99s case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality refers to one additional case, namely Berghuis v. Thompkins, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 370 (2010)\n.  See ante, at 8.  But that case is here beside the point.  In Berghuis, the defendant was in custody, he had been informed of his Miranda rights, and he was subsequently silent in the face of 2 hours and 45 minutes of questioning before he offered any substantive answers.  Id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934).  The Court held that he had waived his \n \nFifth Amendment rights in respect to his later speech.  The Court said nothing at all about a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s right to comment on his preceding silence and no prosecutor sought to do so.  Indeed, how could a prosecutor lawfully have tried to do so, given this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement in Mi- randa itself that a prosecutor cannot comment on the fact that, after receiving Miranda warnings, the suspect \xe2\x80\x9cstood mute\xe2\x80\x9d?  384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 468, n.\xc2\xa037.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe end where we began.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o ritualistic formula is necessary in order to invoke the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Quinn, 349 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  Much depends on the circumstances of the particular case, the most important circumstances being: (1) whether one can fairly infer that the individual being questioned is invoking the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection; (2) if that is unclear, whether it is particularly important for the questioner to know whether the individual is doing so; and (3) even if it is, whether, in any event, there is a good reason for excusing the individual from referring to the \n \nFifth Amendment, such as inherent penalization simply by answering.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying these principles to the present case, I would hold that Salinas need not have expressly invoked the \n \nFifth Amendment.  The context was that of a criminal investigation.  Police told Salinas that and made clear that he was a suspect.  His interrogation took place at the police station.  Salinas was not represented by counsel.  The relevant question\xe2\x80\x94about whether the shotgun from Salinas\xe2\x80\x99 home would incriminate him\xe2\x80\x94amounted to a switch in subject matter.  And it was obvious that the new question sought to ferret out whether Salinas was guilty of murder.  See 368 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 552\xe2\x80\x93553.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese circumstances give rise to a reasonable inference that Salinas\xe2\x80\x99 silence derived from an exercise of his \n \nFifth Amendment rights.  This Court has recognized repeatedly that many, indeed most, Americans are aware that they have a constitutional right not to incriminate themselves by answering questions posed by the police during an interrogation conducted in order to figure out the perpetrator of a crime.  See Dickerson v. United States, \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428, \n443 (2000)\n; Brogan v. United States, \n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398, \n405 (1998)\n; Michigan v. Tucker, \n\n417 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433, \n439 (1974)\n.  The nature of the surroundings, the switch of topic, the particular question\xe2\x80\x94all suggested that the right we have and generally know we have was at issue at the critical moment here.  Salinas, not being represented by counsel, would not likely have used the precise words \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d to invoke his rights because he would not likely have been aware of technical legal requirements, such as a need to identify the \n \nFifth Amendment by name.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the need to categorize Salinas\xe2\x80\x99 silence as based on the \n \nFifth Amendment is supported here by the presence, in full force, of the predicament I discussed earlier, namely that of not forcing Salinas to choose between incrimination through speech and incrimination through silence.  That need is also supported by the absence of any special reason that the police had to know, with certainty, whether Salinas was, in fact, relying on the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94such as whether to doubt that there really was a risk of self-incrimination, see Hoffman v. United States, \n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479, \n486 (1951)\n, or whether to grant immunity, see Kastigar, 406 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 448.  Given these circumstances, Salinas\xe2\x80\x99 silence was \xe2\x80\x9csufficient to put the [government] on notice of an apparent claim of the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Quinn, supra, at 164.  That being so, for reasons similar to those given in Griffin, the \n \nFifth Amendment bars the evidence of silence admitted against Salinas and mentioned by the prosecutor.  See 380 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 614\xe2\x80\x93615.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tD\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI recognize that other cases may arise where facts and circumstances surrounding an individual\xe2\x80\x99s silence present a closer question.  The critical question\xe2\x80\x94whether those circumstances give rise to a fair inference that the silence rests on the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94will not always prove easy to administer.  But that consideration does not support the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s rule-based approach here, for the administrative problems accompanying the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s approach are even worse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe plurality says that a suspect must \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly invoke the privilege against self-incrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 1.  But does it really mean that the suspect must use the exact words \xe2\x80\x9c\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d?  How can an individual who is not a lawyer know that these particular words are legally magic?  Nor does the Solicitor General help when he adds that the suspect may \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] the claim \xe2\x80\x98in any language that [the questioner] may reasonably be expected to understand as an attempt to invoke the privilege.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 22 (quoting Quinn, supra, at 162\xe2\x80\x93163; alteration in original).  What counts as \xe2\x80\x9cmaking the claim\xe2\x80\x9d?  Suppose the individual says, \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s discuss something else,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I want to answer that\xe2\x80\x9d; or suppose he just gets up and leaves the room.  Cf. Davis v.

At the same time, acknowledging that our case law does not require use of specific words, see ante, at 2, leaves the plurality without the administrative benefits it might hope to find in requiring that detail.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFar better, in my view, to pose the relevant question directly: Can one fairly infer from an individual\xe2\x80\x99s silence and surrounding circumstances an exercise of the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s privilege?  The need for simplicity, the constitutional importance of applying the \n \nFifth Amendment to those who seek its protection, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law all suggest that this is the right question to ask here.  And the answer to that question in the circumstances of today\xe2\x80\x99s case is clearly: yes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I believe that the \n \nFifth Amendment prohibits a prosecutor from commenting on Salinas\xe2\x80\x99s silence.
