At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster asserted a defense of diminished capacity.  Under then-prevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, the diminished-capacity defense permitted a legally sane defendant to present evidence of mental illness to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.  Apparently unpersuaded by Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s defense, the jury convicted him of first-degree murder and a related firearm offense.  Lancaster, however, later obtained federal habeas relief from these convictions.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy the time of Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s retrial, the Michigan Supreme Court had rejected the diminished-capacity defense in its 2001 decision in Carpenter.  Although the murder with which Lancaster was charged occurred several years before Carpenter was decided, the judge at his second trial applied Carpenter and therefore disallowed renewal of his diminished-capacity defense.  Lancaster was again convicted.  Affirming, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s retroactive application of Carpenter vio- lated due process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLancaster reasserted his due process claim in a federal habeas petition.

Concluding that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 rejection of the diminished-capacity defense was unforeseeable in April 1993, when Lancaster killed his girlfriend, the Sixth Circuit held that, by rejecting Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s due process claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals had unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Lancaster is not entitled to federal habeas relief.

They were convicted under a South Carolina trespass statute pro- hibiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98entry upon the lands of another .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  378 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350.  The South Carolina Supreme Court based its affirmance of the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions on its prior decision in Mitchell, where the court held that the trespass statute reached both unauthorized entries and \xe2\x80\x9cthe act of remaining on the premises of another after receiving notice to leave.\xe2\x80\x9d  378 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 350.  Mitchell, however, was rendered 21 months after the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 arrest.  This Court held that the Due Process Clause prohibited Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s retroactive application to the Bouie petitioners, stressing that Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the state trespass statute was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly at variance with the statutory language\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not the slightest support in prior South Carolina decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  378 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 356.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Rogers, the petitioner contested the Tennessee Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s retroactive abolition of the common-law \xe2\x80\x9cyear and a day rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which barred a murder conviction \xe2\x80\x9cunless [the] victim had died by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s act within a year and a day of the act.\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 453.  This Court found no due process violation.  \xe2\x80\x9c[J]udicial alteration of a common law doctrine of criminal law,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held, \xe2\x80\x9cviolates the principle of fair warning, and hence must not be given retroactive effect, only where [the alteration] is \xe2\x80\x98unexpected and indefensible by reference to the law which had been expressed prior to the conduct in issue.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 462.

Two years later, the Michigan Legislature prescribed comprehensive requirements for defenses based on mental illness or retardation.  In 1978, the Michigan Court of Appeals ruled that the diminished-capacity defense fit within the codified definition of insanity.  The Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s 2001 decision in Carpenter, however, rejected that position, holding that the diminished-capacity defense was not encompassed within the Michigan Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive scheme for mental-illness defenses and thus could not be invoked by criminal defendants.

This case is a far cry from Bouie, where the South Carolina Supreme Court unexpectedly expanded \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow and precise statutory language\xe2\x80\x9d that, as written, did not reach the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  378 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352.  In Carpenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected a diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably found to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point statute enacted by the Michigan Legislature.  Although Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s due process claim is arguably less weak than the due process claim rejected in Rogers, the Court did not hold in Rogers that a newly announced judicial rule may be applied retroactively only if the rule it replaces was an \xe2\x80\x9coutdated relic\xe2\x80\x9d rarely appearing in a jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99s case law.  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93467.  Distinguishing Rogers thus does little to bolster Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision unreasonably applied clearly established federal law.  This Court has never found a due process violation in circumstances remotely resembling Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s case\xe2\x80\x94i.e., where a state supreme court, squarely addressing a particular issue for the first time, rejected a consistent line of lower court decisions based on the supreme court\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation of the language of a controlling statute.  Fairminded jurists could conclude that a state supreme court decision of that order is not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unexpected and indefensible by reference to [existing] law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 462.

At the time the crime was committed, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s intermediate appellate court had repeatedly recognized \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished capacity\xe2\x80\x9d as a defense negating the mens rea element of first-degree murder.  By the time of Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s trial and conviction, however, the Michigan Supreme Court in People v. Carpenter, 464 Mich. 223, 627 N. W. 2d 276 (2001), had rejected the defense.  Lancaster asserts that retroactive application of the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Carpenter denied him due process of law.  On habeas review, a federal court must assess a claim for relief under the demanding standard set by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  Under that standard, Lancaster may gain relief only if the state-court decision he assails \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or in- volved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  We hold that Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s petition does not meet AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s requirement and that the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit erred in granting him federal habeas relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn April 23, 1993, Lancaster, a former police officer with a long history of severe mental-health problems, shot and killed his girlfriend in a shopping-plaza parking lot.  At his 1994 jury trial in Michigan state court, Lancaster admitted that he had killed his girlfriend but asserted insanity and diminished-capacity defenses.  Under then-prevailing Michigan Court of Appeals precedent, a defendant who pleaded diminished capacity, although he was legally sane, could \xe2\x80\x9coffer evidence of some mental abnormality to negate the specific intent required to commit a particular crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 232, 627 N. W. 2d, at 280.  If a defendant succeeded in showing that mental illness prevented him from \xe2\x80\x9cform[ing] the specific state of mind required as an essential element of a crime,\xe2\x80\x9d he could \xe2\x80\x9cbe convicted only of a lower grade of the offense not requiring that particular mental element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 235, 627 N. W. 2d, at 282.  In rejecting the defense, Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s high court observed that, in 1975, the Michigan Legislature had enacted \xe2\x80\x9ca comprehensive statutory scheme concerning de- fenses based on either mental illness or mental retardation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 236, 627 N.

That scheme, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate[d] the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent to preclude the use of any evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of mental capacity short of legal insan- ity to avoid or reduce criminal responsibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the murder with which Lancaster was charged occurred several years before the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Carpenter, the judge presiding at Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s second trial applied Carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s holding and therefore disallowed renewal of Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s diminished-capacity defense.

This Court held that the convictions violated the due process requirement that \xe2\x80\x9ca criminal statute give fair warning of the conduct which it prohibits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 350.  The state statute under which the petitioners were convicted, the Court emphasized, prohibited \xe2\x80\x9centry upon the lands of another .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. after notice from the owner or tenant prohibiting such entry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350 (emphasis added and internal quotation marks omitted).  It was undisputed that the petitioners were invited to enter the store and had received no notice that they were barred from the restaurant area before they occupied booth seats.  Id., at 350.  Nevertheless, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 convictions based on its prior decision in Charleston v.

The \xe2\x80\x9cdue process limitations on the retroactive application of judicial decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, are not coextensive with the limitations placed on legislatures by the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Ex Post Facto Clauses.

First, the rule was \xe2\x80\x9cwidely viewed as an outdated relic of the common law\xe2\x80\x9d and had been \xe2\x80\x9clegislatively or judicially abolished in the vast majority of jurisdictions recently to have addressed the issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rogers, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93463.

Mangia- pane, 85 Mich. App. 379, 395, 271 N. W. 2d 240, 249.  Therefore, the court held, a defendant claiming that he lacked the \xe2\x80\x9cmental capacity to entertain the specific intent required as an element of the crime with which he [was] charged\xe2\x80\x9d had to comply with the statutory procedural requirements applicable to insanity defenses, including the requirements of pretrial notice and submission to court-ordered examination.

See People v. McRunels, 237 Mich. App. 168, 172, 603 N. W. 2d 95, 98 (1999).  Under that framework, a criminal defendant bore the initial burden of present- ing some evidence of insanity, at which point the burden shifted to the prosecution to prove the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sanity beyond a reasonable doubt.  See In\xc2\xa0re Certified Question, 425 Mich. 457, 465\xe2\x80\x93466, 390 N. W. 2d 620, 623\xe2\x80\x93624 (1986); People v. Savoie, 419 Mich. 118, 126, 349 N. W. 2d 139, 143 (1984).  The Michigan Court of Appeals applied the same burden-shifting framework to the diminished-capacity defense.  See People v. Denton, 138 Mich. App. 568, 571\xe2\x80\x93572, 360 N.

Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7768.21a, the statute codifying the insanity defense, to provide that the defendant bears \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of proving the defense of insanity by a preponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  1994 Mich. Pub. Acts p. 252 (codified at \xc2\xa7768.21a(3)).  In Carpenter, the defendant argued that the trial court had erred by applying the 1994 Act to require him to establish his diminished-capacity defense by a preponderance of the evidence.  464 Mich., at 225\xe2\x80\x93226, 235, 627 N. W. 2d, at 277, 282.  Rejecting this contention, the Michigan Court of Appeals affirmed the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  See People v. Carpenter, No. 204051, 1999 WL 33438799 (July 16, 1999) (per curiam).  Consistent with its decision in Mangiapane, the court held that the 1994 statutory amendments applied to defendants raising the diminished-capacity defense, and it further held that requiring defendants to establish their diminished capacity by a preponderance of the evidence did not unconstitutionally relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the mens rea elements of a crime beyond a reasonable doubt.

As earlier stated, see supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, the court concluded that in no case could criminal defendants invoke the diminished-capacity defense, for that defense was not encompassed within the \xe2\x80\x9ccomprehensive statutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d the Michigan Legislature had enacted to govern defenses based on mental illness or retardation.  Carpenter, 464 Mich., at 236, 627 N. W. 2d, at 282.

As earlier Michigan Court of Appeals decisions indicate, see supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310, the bearing of the 1975 legislation on the diminished-capacity defense may not have been apparent pre-Carpenter.  But in light of our precedent and the his- tory recounted above, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B\xe2\x80\x931, supra, the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision applying Carpenter retroac- tively does not warrant disapprobation as \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly established [f]ederal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case is a far cry from Bouie, where, unlike Rogers, the Court held that the retroactive application of a judicial decision violated due process.  In Bouie, the South Caro- lina Supreme Court had unexpectedly expanded \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow and precise statutory language\xe2\x80\x9d that, as written, did not reach the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  378 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352.  In Carpenter, by contrast, the Michigan Supreme Court rejected a diminished-capacity defense that the court reasonably found to have no home in a comprehensive, on-point statute enacted by the Michigan Legislature.  Carpenter thus presents the inverse of the situation this Court confronted in Bouie.  Rather than broadening a statute that was narrow on its face, Carpenter disapproved lower court precedent recognizing a defense Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s high court found, on close inspection, to lack statutory grounding.  The situation we confronted in Bouie bears scant resemblance to this case, and our resolution of that controversy hardly makes disallowance of Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s diminished-capacity defense an unreasonable reading of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn the other hand, as the Sixth Circuit recognized, see 683 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 749\xe2\x80\x93751, Lancaster\xe2\x80\x99s argument against applying Carpenter retroactively is arguably less weak than the argument opposing retroactivity we rejected in Rogers.  Unlike the year and a day rule at issue in Rogers, the diminished-capacity defense is not an \xe2\x80\x9coutdated relic of the common law\xe2\x80\x9d widely rejected by modern courts and legislators.  532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462.  To the contrary, the Model Penal Code sets out a version of the defense.  See ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa74.02(1), pp. 216\xe2\x80\x93217 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cEvidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect is admissible whenever it is relevant to prove that the defendant did or did not have a state of mind that is an element of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d).
