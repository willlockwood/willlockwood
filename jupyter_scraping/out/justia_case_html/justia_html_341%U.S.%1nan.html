JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 205(e) of the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, authorized the Price Administrator, under certain circumstances, to institute damage actions against sellers of commodities who charged more than prescribed ceiling prices. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Pursuant to this section, the consolidated cases now before us were brought in the District Court by the Administrator in his own name "for and on behalf of the United States," and were properly ending there on April 23, 1947. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On that day, the President, in connection with the termination of price controls, promulgated Executive Orders Nos. 9841 and 9842: [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  No. 9841, among other things, transferred various price administration functions to the Secretary of Commerce; No. 9842, so far as here material, authorized the Attorney General to conduct certain \xc2\xa7205(e) litigation "in the name of the United States or otherwise as permitted by law. . . ."  In view of these orders, the Attorney General promptly moved to substitute the United States as party plaintiff in the present proceedings.  Although the district judge granted the motion, he dismissed the complaints in 1950 on the ground that there had been an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 341 U. S. 3</a></p><p> improper substitution because the suits could not be maintained in the name of the United States. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  183 F.2d 453.  It held that the President, in his Executive Orders, did not intend to authorize conduct of \xc2\xa7 205(e) actions in the name of the United States.  A belief that the President had no power to do so led the court to this conclusion.  To resolve the conflict between the decision and those from other circuits, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] we granted certiorari.  340 U.S. 895.</p>\n<p>We hold that it was error to construe the Executive Orders as not allowing maintenance of these suits in the name of the United States.  It is true that Order No. 9841, which transferred various OPA functions to the Secretary of Commerce, empowered the Secretary to</p>\n<p>"institute, maintain, or defend <em>in his own name</em> civil proceedings in any court . . . relating to the matters transferred to him, including any such proceedings pending on the effective date of the transfer. . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  But this provision demonstrates no purpose to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 341 U. S. 4</a></p><p> vest exclusive power in the Secretary to maintain all \xc2\xa7 205(e) enforcement actions.  By its express terms, it is made subject to Executive Order 9842, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] which directs the Attorney General to "coordinate, conduct, initiate, maintain or defend" litigation against violators of price control "in the name of the United States or otherwise as permitted by law. . . ." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  All interested government agencies have construed the two orders together as authorizing the Attorney General to carry on \xc2\xa7 205(e) enforcement cases, and to do so in the name of the United States.  The Emergency Court of Appeals and other courts of appeal have taken the same view. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  We believe that such a reading of the orders is the most reasonable construction of the language employed.</p>\n<p>The substitution of the United States in these cases therefore was proper unless, as the Court of Appeals thought, the President lacked power to authorize it.  The view below was that \xc2\xa7 205(e) of the Price Control Act permitted enforcement suits to be brought only in the name of the Price Administrator, or, when the bulk of his duties were transferred to the Secretary of Commerce, in the name of the latter.  Such a conclusion, however, is certainly not compelled by the section, which provides </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 341 U. S. 5</a></p><p> merely for the bringing of actions by "the Administrator . . . on behalf of the United States. . . ."  There can be no question but that the President, as a step in the winding-up process, had power to transfer any or all of the price administration functions to the Attorney General.  <em>Fleming v. Mohawk Wrecking &amp; Lumber Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/111/case.html">331 U. S. 111</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/331/111/case.html#113">331 U. S. 113</a></span>-119.  Accordingly, Executive Order 9842 could lawfully delegate the control and direction of the present actions to that official.  Moreover, nothing in \xc2\xa7 205(e) prevents the Attorney General, who is customarily charged with representing the Government\'s interests in court, from following his normal procedure of maintaining enforcement suits in the name of the United States itself. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  No unfairness to the defendants will result.  Regardless of captions, the issues in these cases could not change, and the real party in interest plaintiff has always been the same.  <em>Cf. United States v. Remund,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/539/case.html">330 U.

The handling of this litigation in the name of the United States is a fair and orderly method for carrying out the congressional mandate to wind up the OPA affairs.  These cases should not have been dismissed. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS and MR.
