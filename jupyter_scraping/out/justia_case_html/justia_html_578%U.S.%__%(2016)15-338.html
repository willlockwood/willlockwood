Carrying out this responsibility, the Attorney General appoints, as independent contractors, private attorneys, naming them \xe2\x80\x9cspecial counsel\xe2\x80\x9d to act on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s behalf.  The Attorney General requires special counsel to use the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead in communicating with debtors.  Among the special counsel appointed by the Attorney General in 2012 were petitioners Mark Sheriff and Eric Jones.  Consistent with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s direction, Sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s law firm and Jones sent debt collection letters on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead to respondents Hazel Meadows and Pamela Gillie, respectively.

Each letter also identified the sender as a debt collector seeking payment for debts to a state institution.  Meadows and Gillie filed a putative class action in Federal District Court, alleging that defendants had, by using the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, employed deceptive and misleading means to attempt to collect consumer debts, in violation of the FDCPA.  The Ohio Attorney General intervened, seeking a declaratory judgment that special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead is neither false nor misleading, and urging that special counsel be deemed officers of the State exempted from the Act.  The District Court granted summary judgment for defendants, holding that special counsel are \xe2\x80\x9cofficers\xe2\x80\x9d of the State and, in any event, their use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead is not false or misleading.  The Sixth Circuit vacated that judgment, concluding that special counsel, as independent contractors, are not entitled to the FDCPA\xe2\x80\x99s state-officer exemption.  The appeals court remanded for trial the question whether use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead would mislead a debtor into believing that it is the Attorney General who is collecting the debt. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Assuming, <i>arguendo</i>, that special counsel do not rank as \xe2\x80\x9cstate officers\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Act, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, nevertheless, does not offend \xc2\xa71692e.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead at the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s direction does not offend \xc2\xa71692e\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9cfalse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or misleading representation[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  The letterhead identifies the principal\xe2\x80\x94Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General\xe2\x80\x94and the signature block names the agent\xe2\x80\x94a private lawyer hired as outside counsel to the Attorney General.  The character of the relationship between special counsel and the Attorney General bolsters the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.

Because the Attorney General authorized\xe2\x80\x94indeed required\xe2\x80\x94special counsel to use his letterhead, special counsel create no false impression in doing just that.  Nor did special counsel use an untrue name in their letters, in violation of \xc2\xa71692e(14).  Special counsel do not employ a false name when they use the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead at his instruction, for special counsel act as the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s agents in debt-related matters.  The Court sees no reason, furthermore, to construe the FDCPA in a manner that would interfere with the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method of fulfilling his statutory obligation to collect the State\xe2\x80\x99s debts. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Sixth Circuit raises the specter of consumer confusion and the risk of intimidation from special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, but its exposition is unconvincing.

Special counsel and Assistant Attorneys General even stand in one another\xe2\x80\x99s stead, as needed, to cover proceedings in ongoing litigation.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Given special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s alliance with attorneys within the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office, a debtor\xe2\x80\x99s impression that a letter from special counsel is a letter from the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Office is scarcely inaccurate.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On safe ground with respect to \xc2\xa71692e\xe2\x80\x99s general proscription against false and misleading representations, special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead is consistent too with \xc2\xa71692e(9)\xe2\x80\x99s specific prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely represent[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d that a communication is \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized, issued, or approved\xe2\x80\x9d by a State.  In enacting this provision, Congress sought to prevent debt collectors from \xe2\x80\x9cmisrepresenting\xe2\x80\x9d that they are \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment official[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Rep. No. 95\xe2\x80\x93382, p. 8 (1977).  Here, the Attorney General authorized\xe2\x80\x94indeed required\xe2\x80\x94special counsel to use his letterhead in sending debt collection communications.  Special counsel create no false impression in doing just what they have been instructed to do.  Instead, their use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead conveys on whose authority special counsel writes to the debtor.  As a whole, the communication alerts the debtor to both the basis for the payment obligation and the official responsible for enforcement of debts owed to the State, while the signature block conveys who the Attorney General has engaged to collect the debt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor did special counsel, in sending letters on the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, use a name other than their \xe2\x80\x9ctrue name,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of \xc2\xa71692e(14).  Although the FDCPA does not say \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a \xe2\x80\x98true name\xe2\x80\x99 is, its import is straightforward: A debt collector may not lie about his institutional affiliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1115 (Sutton, J., dissenting).  Special counsel do not employ a false name when using the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead at his instruction, for special counsel, as the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s agents, act for him in debt-related matters.  Far from misrepresenting special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s identity, letters sent by special counsel accurately identify the office primarily responsible for collection of the debt (the Attorney General), special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s affiliation with that office, and the address (special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s law firm) to which payment should be sent.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We further note a federalism concern.  \xe2\x80\x9cOhio\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of its civil code\xe2\x80\x94by collecting money owed to it\xe2\x80\x94[is] a core sovereign function.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gillie</i> v. <i>Law Office of Eric A.

Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General has chosen toappoint special counsel to assist him in fulfilling his obliga-tion to collect the State\xe2\x80\x99s debts, and he has instructed his appointees to use his letterhead when acting on his behalf.  There is no cause, in this case, to construe federal law in a manner that interferes with<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cStates\xe2\x80\x99 arrangements for conducting their own governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nixon</i> v. <i>Missouri Municipal League</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125,\n140 (2004)\n (citing <i>Greg-ory</i> v. <i>Ashcroft</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452,\n460 (1991)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s contrary exposition is unconvincing.  Use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, the Court of Appeals emphasized, has led to confusion among debtors, as the Attorney General has received phone calls inquiring whether letters sent by special counsel are authentic.  785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1107.  But the Sixth Circuit overlooked that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s prompt and invariable answer to those inquiries was \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  To the extent that consumers may be concerned that the letters are a \xe2\x80\x9cscam,\xe2\x80\x9d the solution is for special counsel to say more, not less, about their role as agents of the Attorney General.  Special counsel\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead, furthermore, encourages consumers to use official channels to ensure the legitimacy of the letters, assuaging the very concern the Sixth Circuit identified.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to the specter of consumer confusion, the Sixth Circuit stressed the risk of intimidation\xe2\x80\x94that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead would \xe2\x80\x9cplace pressure on those individuals receiving the letters\xe2\x80\x9d to pay their state debts.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1105.  There are two bases for this concern, neither of which is persuasive.  First, invocation of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s <i>imprimatur</i> could lead debtors to prioritize their debt to the State over other, private debts out of a belief that the consequences of failing to pay a state debt would be more severe.  This impression is not false; the State does have enforcement powers beyond those afforded private creditors.  A debtor\xe2\x80\x99s tax refund, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cmay be applied in satisfaction\xe2\x80\x9d of her debt, regardless of whether the State has obtained a judgment, Ohio Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa75747.12 (Lexis 2013), and a debt owed to the State takes priority over most private debts in state probate proceedings, \xc2\xa72117.25(A) (Lexis Supp. 2015).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe special consequences of state debts explain why the Act bars debt collectors <i>unaffiliated</i> with a State from using the State\xe2\x80\x99s name to scare debtors into paying.  When the State itself is doing the demanding, however, nothing about the resulting fear misleads.\xe2\x80\x9d  785 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1116 (Sutton, J., dissenting).  In other words, \xc2\xa71692e bars debt collectors from deceiving or misleading consumers; it does not protect consumers from fearing the actual consequences of their debts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, debtors might worry that the letters imply that the Attorney General, as the State\xe2\x80\x99s top law enforcement official, intends to take punitive action against them.  \xe2\x80\x9cBut neither of the milquetoast letters [received by respondents] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. threatens criminal prosecution, civil penalties, or any action whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1116\xe2\x80\x931117.  Use of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s letterhead merely clarifies that the debt is owed to the State, and the Attorney General is the State\xe2\x80\x99s debt collector.
