Argued November 4, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 13, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent was the chairman, chief executive officer, and sole shareholder of ETS Payphones, Inc., which sold payphones to the public via independent distributors.  The payphones were offered with an agreement under which ETS leased back the payphone from the purchaser for a fixed monthly payment, thereby giving purchasers a fixed 14% annual return on their investment.  Although ETS\xe2\x80\x99 marketing materials trumpeted the \xe2\x80\x9cincomparable pay phone\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can exciting business opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d the payphones did not generate enough revenue for ETS to make the payments required by the leaseback agreements, so the company depended on funds from new investors to meet its obligations.  After ETS filed for bankruptcy protection, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) brought this civil enforcement action, alleging, among other things, that respondent and ETS had violated registration requirements and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 10b\xe2\x80\x935 thereunder.  The District Court concluded that the sale-and-leaseback arrangement was an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of, and therefore subject to, the federal securities laws.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that (1) this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions require an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract\xe2\x80\x9d to offer either capital appreciation or a participation in an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s earnings, and thus exclude schemes offering a fixed rate of return; and (2) those opinions\xe2\x80\x99 requirement that the return on the investment be derived solely from the efforts of others was not satisfied when the purchasers had a contractual entitlement to the return.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0An investment scheme promising a fixed rate of return can be an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract\xe2\x80\x9d and thus a \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the federal securities laws.  Section 2(a)(1) of the 1933 Act and \xc2\xa73(a)(10) of the 1934 Act define \xe2\x80\x9csecurity\xe2\x80\x9d to include an \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract,\xe2\x80\x9d but do not define \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has established that the test for determining whether a particular scheme is an investment contract is \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>W. J. Howey Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/293/index.html">328 U. S. 293</a>, 301.  This definition embodies a flexible, rather than a static, principle that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those seeking to use others\xe2\x80\x99 money on the promise of profits.  <em>Id.,</em> at 299.  The profits this Court was speaking of in <em>Howey</em> are profits\xe2\x80\x94in the sense of the income or return\xe2\x80\x94that investors seek on their investment, not the profits of the scheme in which they invest, and may include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment.  There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns for purposes of the test, so understood.  In both cases, the investing public is attracted by representations of investment income.  Moreover, investments pitched as low risk (such as those offering a \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed\xe2\x80\x9d fixed return) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud, including older and less sophisticated investors.  Under the reading respondent advances, unscrupulous marketers of investments could evade the securities laws by picking a rate of return to promise.  This Court will not read into the securities laws a limitation not compelled by the language that would so undermine the laws\xe2\x80\x99 purposes.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that including investment schemes promising a fixed return among investment contracts conflicts with precedent is mistaken, as no distinction between fixed and variable returns was drawn in the blue sky law cases that the <em>Howey</em> Court relied on, and no post-<em>Howey</em> decision is to the contrary, see <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc.</em> v. <em>Forman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/837/index.html">421 U.

The Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s alternative holding, that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s scheme falls outside the definition because purchasers had a contractual entitlement to a return, is incorrect and inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) argues that the arrangements were investment contracts, and thus were subject to regulation under the federal securities laws.  In this case, we must decide whether a moneymaking scheme is excluded from the term \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract\xe2\x80\x9d simply because the scheme offered a contractual entitlement to a fixed, rather than a variable, return.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Charles Edwards was the chairman, chief executive officer, and sole shareholder of ETS Payphones, Inc. (ETS).*<footcall num="*">  ETS, acting partly through a subsidiary also controlled by respondent, sold payphones to the public via independent distributors.  The payphones were offered packaged with a site lease, a 5-year leaseback and management agreement, and a buyback agreement.  All but a tiny fraction of purchasers chose this package, although other management options were offered.  The purchase price for the payphone packages was approximately $7,000.  Under the leaseback and management agreement, purchasers received $82 per month, a 14% annual return.  Purchasers were not involved in the day-to-day operation of the payphones they owned.  ETS selected the site for the phone, installed the equipment, arranged for connection and long-distance service, collected coin revenues, and maintained and repaired the phones.  Under the buyback agreement, ETS promised to refund the full purchase price of the package at the end of the lease or within 180 days of a purchaser\xe2\x80\x99s request.</footcall></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its marketing materials and on its website, ETS trumpeted the \xe2\x80\x9cincomparable pay phone\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9can exciting business opportunity,\xe2\x80\x9d in which recent deregulation had \xe2\x80\x9copen[ed] the door for profits for individual pay phone owners and operators.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to ETS, \xe2\x80\x9c[v]ery few business opportunities can offer the potential for ongoing revenue generation that is available in today\xe2\x80\x99s pay telephone industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 114\xe2\x80\x93115 (ETS brochure); <em>id., </em>at 227 (ETS website); see <em>id.</em>, at 13 (Complaint \xc2\xb6  ;\xc2\xb6  ;37\xe2\x80\x9338).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The payphones did not generate enough revenue for ETS to make the payments required by the leaseback agreements, so the company depended on funds from new investors to meet its obligations.  In September 2000, ETS filed for bankruptcy protection.  The SEC brought this civil enforcement action the same month.  It alleged that respondent and ETS had violated the registration requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75(a) and (c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 68 Stat. 684, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777e(a), (c), the antifraud provisions of both \xc2\xa717(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, 114 Stat. 2763A\xe2\x80\x93452, 15 U.

The District Court concluded that the payphone sale-and-leaseback arrangement was an investment contract within the meaning of, and therefore was subject to, the federal securities laws.  <em>SEC</em> v. <em>ETS Payphones, Inc.,</em> 123 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1349 (ND Ga. 2000).  The Court of Appeals reversed.  300 F.\xc2\xa03d 1281 (CA11 2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  It held that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s scheme was not an investment contract, on two grounds.  First, it read this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions to require that an investment contract offer either capital appreciation or a participation in the earnings of the enterprise, and thus to exclude schemes, such as respondent\xe2\x80\x99s, offering a fixed rate of return.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1284\xe2\x80\x931285.  Second, it held that our opinions\xe2\x80\x99 requirement that the return on the investment be \xe2\x80\x9cderived solely from the efforts of others\xe2\x80\x9d was not satisfied when the purchasers had a contractual entitlement to the return.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1285.

To that end, it enacted a broad definition of \xe2\x80\x9csecurity,\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient \xe2\x80\x9cto encompass virtually any instrument that might be sold as an investment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

J. Howey Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/293/index.html">328 U. S. 293</a> (1946).  We look to \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the scheme involves an investment of money in a common enterprise with profits to come solely from the efforts of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 301.  This definition \xe2\x80\x9cembodies a flexible rather than a static principle, one that is capable of adaptation to meet the countless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 299.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching that result, we first observed that when Congress included \xe2\x80\x9cinvestment contract\xe2\x80\x9d in the definition of security, it \xe2\x80\x9cwas using a term the meaning of which had been crystallized\xe2\x80\x9d by the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of their \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98blue sky\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d laws.  <em>Id.</em>, at 298.  (Those laws were the precursors to federal securities regulation and were so named, it seems, because they were \xe2\x80\x9caimed at promoters who \xe2\x80\x98would sell building lots in the blue sky in fee simple.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  1 L. Loss &amp; J. Seligman, Securities Regulation 36, 31\xe2\x80\x9343 (3d ed. 1998) (quoting Mulvey, Blue Sky Law, 36 Can. L. Times 37 (1916)).)  The state courts had defined an investment contract as \xe2\x80\x9ca contract or scheme for \xe2\x80\x98the placing of capital or laying out of money in a way intended to secure income or profit from its employment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9cuniformly applied\xe2\x80\x9d that definition to \xe2\x80\x9ca variety of situations where individuals were led to invest money in a common enterprise with the expectation that they would earn a profit solely through the efforts of the promoter or [a third party].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 298 (quoting <em>State</em> v. <em>Gopher Tire &amp; Rubber Co.,</em> 146 Minn. 52, 56, 177 N.\xc2\xa0W. 937, 938 (1920)).  Thus, when we held that \xe2\x80\x9cprofits\xe2\x80\x9d must \xe2\x80\x9ccome solely from the efforts of others,\xe2\x80\x9d we were speaking of the profits that investors seek on their investment, not the profits of the scheme in which they invest.  We used \xe2\x80\x9cprofits\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense of income or return, to include, for example, dividends, other periodic payments, or the increased value of the investment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason to distinguish between promises of fixed returns and promises of variable returns for purposes of the test, so understood.  In both cases, the investing public is attracted by representations of investment income, as purchasers were in this case by ETS\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98watch the profits add up.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 13 (Complaint \xc2\xb6  ;38). Moreover, investments pitched as low-risk (such as those offering a \xe2\x80\x9cguaranteed\xe2\x80\x9d fixed return) are particularly attractive to individuals more vulnerable to investment fraud, including older and less sophisticated investors.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep.\xc2\xa0No. 102\xe2\x80\x93261, Vol. 2, App., p.\xc2\xa0326 (1992) (Staff Summary of Federal Trade Commission Activities Affecting Older Consumers).  Under the reading respondent advances, unscrupulous marketers of investments could evade the securities laws by picking a rate of return to promise.  We will not read into the securities laws a limitation not compelled by the language that would so undermine the laws\xe2\x80\x99 purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent protests that including investment schemes promising a fixed return among investment contracts conflicts with our precedent.  We disagree.  No distinction between fixed and variable returns was drawn in the blue sky law cases that the <em>Howey</em> Court used, in formulating the test, as its evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the term.  <em>Howey,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 298, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Indeed, two of those cases involved an investment contract in which a fixed return was promised.  <em>People </em>v. <em>White,</em> 124 Cal. App. 548, 550\xe2\x80\x93551, 12 P. 2d 1078, 1079 (1932) (agreement between defendant and investors stated that investor would give defendant $5,000, and would receive $7,500 from defendant one year later); <em>Stevens</em> v. <em>Liberty Packing Corp.,</em> 111 N.\xc2\xa0J. Eq. 61, 62\xe2\x80\x9363, 161 A. 193, 193\xe2\x80\x93194 (1932) (\xe2\x80\x9cironclad contract\xe2\x80\x9d offered by defendant to investors entitled investors to $56 per year for 10 years on initial investment of $175, ostensibly in sale-and-leaseback of breeding rabbits).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of our post-<em>Howey</em> decisions is to the contrary.  In <em>United Housing Foundation, Inc.</em> v. <em>Forman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/837/index.html">421 U. S. 837</a> (1975), we considered whether \xe2\x80\x9cshares\xe2\x80\x9d in a nonprofit housing cooperative were investment contracts under the securities laws.  We identified the \xe2\x80\x9ctouchstone\xe2\x80\x9d of an investment contract as \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence of an investment in a common venture premised on a reasonable expectation of profits to be derived from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others,\xe2\x80\x9d and then laid out two examples of investor interests that we had previously found to be \xe2\x80\x9cprofits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 852.  Those were \xe2\x80\x9ccapital appreciation resulting from the development of the initial investment\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticipation in earnings resulting from the use of investors\xe2\x80\x99 funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We contrasted those examples, in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe investor is \xe2\x80\x98attracted solely by the prospects of a return\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the investment, with housing cooperative shares, regarding which the purchaser \xe2\x80\x9cis motivated by a desire to use or consume the item purchased.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 852\xe2\x80\x93853 (quoting <em>Howey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 300).  Thus, <em>Forman</em> supports the commonsense understanding of \xe2\x80\x9cprofits\xe2\x80\x9d in the <em>Howey</em> test as simply \xe2\x80\x9cfinancial returns on . . . investments.\xe2\x80\x9d  421 U. S., at 853.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concededly, <em>Forman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s illustrative description of prior decisions on \xe2\x80\x9cprofits\xe2\x80\x9d appears to have been mistaken for an exclusive list in a case considering the scope of a different term in the definition of a security, \xe2\x80\x9cnote.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Reves</em>, 494 U. S., at 68, n.\xc2\xa04.  But that was a misreading of <em>Forman</em>, and we will not bind ourselves unnecessarily to passing dictum that would frustrate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to regulate all of the \xe2\x80\x9ccountless and variable schemes devised by those who seek the use of the money of others on the promise of profits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Howey</em>, 328 U. S., at 299.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s position is supported neither by the purposes of the securities laws nor by our precedents, it is no surprise that the SEC has consistently taken the opposite position, and maintained that a promise of a fixed return does not preclude a scheme from being an investment contract.  It has done so in formal adjudications, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Abbett, Sommer &amp; Co.,</em> 44 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0C. 104 (1969) (holding that mortgage notes, sold with a package of management services and a promise to repurchase the notes in the event of default, were investment contracts); see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Union Home Loans</em> (Dec. 16, 1982), 26 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa0C.
