Green, 430 U.S.  462 (1977)</h3><p><b>Santa Fe Indus., Inc. v. Green</b></p><p><b>No. 75-1753</b></p><p><b>Argued January 18-19, 1977</b></p><p><b>Decided March 23, 1977</b></p><p><b>430 U.S. 462</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Delaware\'s "short-form merger" statute enables a parent company owning at least 90% of the stock of a subsidiary to merge with the subsidiary upon approval of the parent company\'s board of directors, and to make cash payments for the minority shareholders\' shares.  Though advance notice to or consent of the minority shareholders is not required, they must be notified within 10 days of the merger\'s effective date, and any dissatisfied minority shareholder may petition the Delaware Court of Chancery for the payment of the fair value of his shares as determined by a court-appointed appraiser subject to court review.  Pursuant to that statutory procedure, petitioner Santa Fe Industries, which had acquired 95% control of another company (Kirby), after obtaining independent appraisals of Kirby\'s assets and submitting them with financial data to a banking firm to appraise the Kirby stock\'s fair market value, decided to offer the minority stockholders $150 per share, which was more than the banking firm\'s appraisal.  The minority stockholders were notified the day after the merger became effective, and advised of their right to obtain an appraisal if dissatisfied with the $150 price, and were given an information statement containing relevant financial data about Kirby, the appraisals of its assets, and the banking firm\'s stock appraisal.  Respondents, minority stockholders who objected to the merger, instead of pursuing their Delaware appraisal remedy, brought this action in District Court seeking to set aside the merger and to recover the fair value for their stock, which they claimed was at least $772 per share.  Respondents alleged that the Kirby stock had been fraudulently appraised in an effort to freeze out the minority stockholders at an inadequate price, in violation of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which makes it</p>\n<p>"unlawful for any person . . . [t]o use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of [Securities and Exchange Commission rules],"</p>\n<p>and Rule 10b-5, issued thereunder, which, in addition to nondisclosure and misrepresentation, prohibits any "artifice to defraud" or any act "which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit."  The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure, with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 430 U.

(2) With regard to the claim that the merger was undertaken without prior notice to minority shareholders, and was solely to eliminate the minority from the company, and therefore lacked any justifiable business purpose, the court concluded that Rule 10b-5 did not override the Delaware corporation law provisions, which do not require a business purpose or prior notice for a short-form merger.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  While not disagreeing with the lower Court\'s conclusions with respect to (1), <em>supra,</em> the Court of Appeals concluded that Rule 10b-5 reached "breaches of fiduciary duty by a majority against minority shareholders without any charge of misrepresentation or lack of disclosure," and that therefore the complaint, taken as a whole, stated a cause of action under the Rule.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The issue in this case involves the reach and coverage of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] thereunder in the context of a Delaware short-form </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 430 U. S. 465</a></p><p> merger transaction used by the majority stockholder of a corporation to eliminate the minority interest.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In 1936, petitioner Santa Fe Industries, Inc. (Santa Fe), acquired control of 60% of the stock of Kirby Lumber Corp. (Kirby), a Delaware corporation.  Through a series of purchases over the succeeding years, Santa Fe increased its control of Kirby\'s stock to 95%; the purchase prices during the period 1968-1973 ranged from $65 to $92.50 per share. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In 1974, wishing to acquire 100% ownership of Kirby, Santa Fe availed itself of \xc2\xa7 253 of the Delaware Corporation Law, known as the "short-form merger" statute.  Section 253 permits a parent corporation owning at least 90% of the stock of a subsidiary to merge with that subsidiary, upon approval by the parent\'s board of directors, and to make payment in cash for the shares of the minority stockholders.  The statute does not require the consent of, or advance notice to, the minority stockholders.  However, notice of the merger must be given within 10 days after its effective date, and any stockholder who is dissatisfied with the terms of the merger may petition the Delaware Court of Chancery for a decree ordering the surviving corporation to pay him the fair value </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 430 U. S. 466</a></p><p> of his shares, as determined by a court-appointed appraiser subject to review by the court.  Del.Code Ann., Tit. 8, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 253, 262 (1975 ed. and Supp. 1976).</p>\n<p>Santa Fe obtained independent appraisals of the physical assets of Kirby -- land, timber, buildings, and machinery -- and of Kirby\'s oil, gas, and mineral interests.  These appraisals, together with other financial information, were submitted to Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. (Morgan Stanley), an investment banking firm retained to appraise the fair market value of Kirby stock.  Kirby\'s physical assets were appraised at $320 million (amounting to $640 for each of the 500,000 shares); Kirby\'s stock was valued by Morgan Stanley at $125 per share.  Under the terms of the merger, minority stockholders were offered $150 per share.</p>\n<p>The provisions of the short-form merger statute were fully complied with. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The minority stockholders of Kirby were notified the day after the merger became effective, and were advised of their right to obtain an appraisal in Delaware court if dissatisfied with the offer of $150 per share.  They also received an information statement containing, in addition to the relevant financial data about Kirby, the appraisals of the value of Kirby\'s assets and the Morgan Stanley appraisal concluding that the fair market value of the stock was $125 per share.</p>\n<p>Respondents, minority stockholders of Kirby, objected to the terms of the merger, but did not pursue their appraisal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 430 U. S. 467</a></p><p> remedy in the Delaware court of Chancery. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Instead, they brought this action in federal court on behalf of the corporation and other minority stockholders, seeking to set aside the merger or to recover what they claimed to be the fair value of their shares.  The amended complaint asserted that, based on the fair market value of Kirby\'s physical assets as revealed by the appraisal included in the information statement sent to minority shareholders, Kirby\'s stock was worth at least $772 per share. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The complaint alleged further that the merger took place without prior notice to minority stockholders; that the purpose of the merger was to appropriate the difference between the "conceded <em>pro rata</em> value of the physical assets," App. 103a, and the offer of $150 per share -- to "freez[e] out the minority stockholders at a wholly inadequate price," <em>id.</em> at 100a; and that Santa Fe, knowing the appraised value of the physical assets, obtained a "fraudulent appraisal" of the stock from Morgan Stanley and offered $25 above that appraisal "in order to lull the minority stockholders into erroneously believing that [Santa Fe was] generous."  <em>Id.</em> at 103a.  This course of conduct was alleged to be</p>\n<p>"a violation of Rule 10b-5 because defendants employed a \'device, scheme, or artifice to defraud\' and engaged in an \'act, practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person, in connection with the purchase or sale </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 430 U. S. 468</a></p><p> of any security.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Morgan Stanley assertedly participated in the fraud as an accessory by submitting its appraisal of $125 per share although knowing the appraised value of the physical assets.</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  391 F.Supp. 849 (SDNY 1975).  As the District Court understood the complaint, respondents\' case rested on two distinct grounds.  First, federal law was assertedly violated because the merger was for the sole purpose of eliminating the minority from the company, therefore lacking any justifiable business purpose, and because the merger was undertaken without prior notice to the minority shareholders.  Second, the low valuation placed on the shares in the cash-exchange offer was itself said to be a fraud actionable under Rule 10b-5.  In rejecting the first ground for recovery, the District Court reasoned that Delaware law required neither a business purpose for a short-form merger nor prior notice to the minority shareholders who the statute contemplated would be removed from the company, and that Rule 10b-5 did not override these provisions of state corporate law by independently placing a duty on the majority not to merge without prior notice and without a justifiable business purpose.</p>\n<p>As for the claim that actionable fraud inhered in the allegedly gross undervaluation of the minority shares, the District Court observed that respondents valued their shares at a minimum of $772 per share, "basing this figure on the <em>pro rata</em> value of Kirby\'s physical assets."  <em>Id.</em> at 853.  Accepting this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 430 U. S. 469</a></p><p> valuation for purpose of the motion to dismiss, the District Court further noted that, as revealed by the complaint, the physical asset appraisal, along with other information relevant to Morgan Stanley\'s valuation of the shares, had been included with the information statement sent to respondents within the time required by state law.  It thought that, if "full and fair disclosure is made, transactions eliminating minority interests are beyond the purview of Rule 10b-5," and concluded that the</p>\n<p>"complaint fail[ed] to allege an omission, misstatement or fraudulent course of conduct that would have impeded a shareholder\'s judgment of the value of the offer."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 854.  The complaint therefore failed to state a claim, and was dismissed. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>A divided Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed.  533 F.2d 1283 (1976).  It first agreed that there was a double aspect to the case:  first, the claim that gross undervaluation of the minority stock itself violated Rule 10b-5; and second, that, "without any misrepresentation or failure to disclose relevant facts, the merger itself constitutes a violation of Rule 10b-5" because it was accomplished without any corporate purpose and without prior notice to the minority stockholders.  <em>Id.</em> at 1285.  As to the first aspect of the case, the Court of Appeals did not disturb the District Court\'s conclusion that the complaint did not allege a material misrepresentation or nondisclosure with respect to the value of the stock; and the court declined to rule that a claim of gross </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 430 U. S. 470</a></p><p> undervaluation itself would suffice to make out a Rule 10b-5 case.  With respect to the second aspect of the case, however, the court fundamentally disagreed with the District Court as to the reach and coverage of Rule 10b-5.  The Court of Appeals\' view was that, although the Rule plainly reached material misrepresentations and nondisclosures in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, neither misrepresentation nor nondisclosure was a necessary element of a Rule 10b-5 action; the Rule reached "breaches of fiduciary duty by a majority against minority shareholders without any charge of misrepresentation or lack of disclosure."  <em>Id.</em> at 1287. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The court went on to hold that the complaint, taken as a whole, stated a cause of action under the Rule:</p>\n<p>"We hold that a complaint alleges a claim under Rule 10b-5 when it charges, in connection with a Delaware short-form merger, that the majority has committed a breach of its fiduciary duty to deal fairly with minority shareholders by effecting the merger without any justifiable business purpose.  The minority shareholders are given no prior notice of the merger, thus having no opportunity to apply for injunctive relief, and the proposed price to be paid is substantially lower than the appraised value reflected in the Information Statement."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1291.  <em>See also id.</em> at 1289. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 430 U. S. 471</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We granted the petition for certiorari challenging this holding because of the importance of the issue involved to the administration of the federal securities laws.  429 U.S. 814 (1976).  We reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 10(b) of the 1934 Act makes it</p>\n<p>"unlawful for any person . . . to use or employ . . . any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of [Securities and Exchange Commission rules];"</p>\n<p>Rule 10b-5, promulgated by the SEC under \xc2\xa7 10(b), prohibits, in addition to nondisclosure and misrepresentation, any "artifice to defraud" or any act "which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The court below construed the term "fraud" in Rule 10b-5 by adverting to the use of the term in several of this Court\'s decisions in contexts other than the 1934 Act and the related Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77a <em>et seq.</em> [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 430 U.

But, as the Court there held, the language of the statute must control the interpretation of the Rule:</p>\n<p>"Rule 10b-5 was adopted pursuant to authority granted the [Securities and Exchange] Commission under \xc2\xa7 10(b).

The finding of the District Court, undisturbed by the Court of Appeals, was that there was no "omission" or "misstatement" in the information statement accompanying the notice of merger.  On the basis of the information provided, minority shareholders could either accept the price offered or reject it and seek an appraisal in the Delaware Court of Chancery.  Their choice was fairly presented, and they were furnished with all relevant information on which to base their decision.

But the cases do not support the proposition, adopted by the Court of Appeals below and urged by respondents here, that a breach of fiduciary duty by majority stockholders, without any deception, misrepresentation, or nondisclosure, violates the statute and the Rule.</p>\n<p>It is also readily apparent that the conduct alleged in the complaint was not "manipulative" within the meaning of the statute.

Congress did not expressly provide a private cause of action for violations of \xc2\xa7 10(b).  Although we have recognized an implied cause of action under that section in some circumstances, <em>Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Life &amp; Cas.

The Delaware Legislature has supplied minority shareholders with a cause of action in the Delaware Court of Chancery to recover the fair value of shares allegedly undervalued in a short-form merger.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/430/462/case.html#465">430 U.

Of course, the existence of a particular state law remedy is not dispositive of the question whether Congress meant to provide a similar federal remedy, but as in <em>Cort</em> and <em>Piper,</em> we conclude that "it is entirely appropriate in this instance to relegate respondent and others in his situation to whatever remedy is created by state law."  422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#84">422 U.

It is difficult to imagine how a court could distinguish, for purposes of Rule 10b-5 fraud, between a majority stockholder\'s use of a short-form merger to eliminate the minority at an unfair price and the use of some other device, such as a long-form merger, tender offer, or liquidation, to achieve the same result; or indeed how a court could distinguish the alleged abuses in these going private transactions from other types of fiduciary self-dealing involving transactions in securities.  The result would be to bring within the Rule a wide variety of corporate conduct traditionally left to state regulation.  In addition to posing a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 430 U. S. 479</a></p><p> "danger of vexatious litigation which could result from a widely expanded class of plaintiffs under Rule 10b-5," <em>Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores,</em> 421 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/723/case.html#740">421 U. S. 740</a></span>, this extension of the federal securities laws would overlap and quite possibly interfere with state corporate law.  Federal courts applying a "federal fiduciary principle" under Rule 10b-5 could be expected to depart from state fiduciary standards at least to the extent necessary to ensure uniformity within the federal system. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Absent a clear indication of congressional intent, we are reluctant to federalize the substantial portion of the law of corporations that deals with transactions in securities, particularly where established state policies of corporate regulation would be overridden.  As the Court stated in <em>Cort v. Ash, supra:</em></p>\n<p>"Corporations are creatures of state law, and investors commit their funds to corporate directors on the understanding that, except where federal law <em>expressly</em> requires certain responsibilities of directors with respect to stockholders, state law will govern the internal affairs of the corporation."</p>\n<p>422 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/66/case.html#84">422 U.

There </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 430 U. S. 480</a></p><p> may well be a need for uniform federal fiduciary standards to govern mergers such as that challenged in this complaint.  But those standards should not be supplied by judicial extension of \xc2\xa7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 to "cover the corporate universe."

Their major contention in this respect is that the majority stockholder\'s failure to give the minority advance notice of the merger was a material nondisclosure, even though the Delaware short-form merger statute does not require such notice.  Brief for Respondents 27.  But respondents do not indicate how they might have acted differently had they had prior notice of the merger.  Indeed, they accept the conclusion of both courts below that, under Delaware law, they could not have enjoined the merger, because an appraisal proceeding is their sole remedy in the Delaware courts for any alleged unfairness in the terms of the merger.  Thus, the failure to give advance notice was not a material nondisclosure within the meaning of the statute or the Rule.  <em>Cf. TSC Industries, Inc. v.
