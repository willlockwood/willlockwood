S. 397</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an action brought by the State of Indiana for taxes on stock of a Tennessee corporation owned by the principal defendant.  The Indiana statutes purport to tax all shares in foreign corporations except national banks, owned by inhabitants of the state, and all shares in domestic corporations when the property of such corporations is not exempt or is not taxable to the corporation itself.  If the value of the stock exceeds that of the tangible taxable property, this excess also is taxed.  Burns\' Indiana State., 1908, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 10,143, 10,233, 10,234.  The declaration was demurred to on the ground that the statutes were contrary to the commerce clause, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 226 U. S. 398</a></p><p> the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  Judgment was entered for the plaintiff, 174 Ind. 143, and a writ of error was allowed.</p>\n<p>The case is pretty nearly disposed of by <em>Kidd v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/730/case.html">188 U. S. 730</a></span>, where the real matter of complaint, that the property of the corporation presumably is taxed in Tennessee, is answered.  <em>See also Wright v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/195/219/case.html">195 U. S. 219</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/195/219/case.html#222">195 U. S. 222</a></span>.  But it is said that the former decision does not deal with the objection that the statutes work a discrimination against stock in corporations of other states, contrary to principles often recognized.  <em>I. M. Darnell &amp; Son. Co. v. Memphis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/208/113/case.html">208 U. S. 113</a></span>.  The most serious aspect of this objection is that the statutes of Indiana do not make allowance if a foreign corporation has property taxed within the state.  But as to this it is enough to say that, however the statutes may be construed in a case of that sort, the plaintiffs in error do not show that it is theirs, and that, as they do not belong to the class for whose sake the constitutional protection would be given, if it would, they cannot complain on that ground.  <em>Smiley v.

Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/118/90/case.html">118 U.
