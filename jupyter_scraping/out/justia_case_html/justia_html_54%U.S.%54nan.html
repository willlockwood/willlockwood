CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 54 U. S. 56</a></p><p></p>\n<p>No counsel has appeared in this Court for the plaintiff in error.  The case has been called in its regular order for argument, and thereupon the counsel for the defendant has, under the 19th rule of the Court, opened the record and argued the case, and prays an affirmance of the judgment with ten percent damages on the ground that the writ of error was issued merely for delay.</p>\n<p>Upon looking into the record, it appears that two exceptions were taken in the court below by the plaintiff in error, and both of them were taken to the refusal of the court to continue the case to the next term.</p>\n<p>It has been repeatedly decided in this Court that a motion for the continuance of the cause addresses itself to the sound judicial discretion of the court, and its decision for or against the motion cannot be assigned as error in this Court.  The rule is so familiar in practice that it is unnecessary to refer to cases to prove it.  The decision of the circuit court, therefore, upon the motions above mentioned, is no ground for reversing the judgment and does not afford any reasonable foundation for suing out this writ of error.</p>\n<p>And upon examining the statement in the exceptions and the reasons assigned by the court for its refusal, the inference would seem to be irresistible that the continuance was not asked for by the plaintiff in error under the expectation that it would enable him to obtain testimony material to his defense, but to delay the payment of a just debt, and that the writ of error was sued out for the same purpose.  The case therefore falls within the 17th rule of the Court, and the judgment is accordingly</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with ten percent interest on the amount from the rendition of the judgment in the circuit court until paid.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Eastern District of Louisiana, and was argued by counsel for the defendant in error.  On consideration whereof, it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said circuit court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed with costs and with interest at the rate of ten percentum per annum on the amount from the rendition of the judgment in the circuit court until paid.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
