Neb.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 8-157(2) (1974).  The two types of "auxiliary teller offices" were defined in Nebraska Department of Banking Reg. \xc2\xa7 81571 (1970).  The Court of Appeals found it "abundantly clear" that a state bank situated like Omaha National would not be permitted to operate the added facility, and ruled that, under 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 36, <em>see First Nat. Bank v. Dickinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/122/case.html">396 U. S. 122</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/122/case.html#135">396 U. S. 135</a></span> (1969), the facility was a branch which the bank was not permitted to operate.  530 F.2d 755, 762 (CA8 1976).  Since the en banc decision, \xc2\xa7 8-157(2) has been amended by Legislative Bill 763, approved by the Governor on March 11, 1976, to redefine "auxiliary teller" facilities which state banks may operate.  It appearing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 426 U. S. 311</a></p><p> that this amendment, which will become effective in July, 1976, may have a substantial bearing on the outcome of this case, the petition for certiorari is granted, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded to the Court of Appeals for reconsideration in light of Legislative Bill 763.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
