ARIZONA</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the court of appeals of arizona</p>\n<p align="left">No. 05\xe2\x80\x935966.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 19, 2006\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 29, 2006</p>\n<p align="left">Petitioner Clark was charged with first-degree murder under an Arizona statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nten[tionally] or knowing[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d killing a police officer in the line of duty.  At his bench trial, Clark did not contest that he shot the officer or that the officer died, but relied on his own undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident to deny that he had the specific intent to shoot an officer or knowledge that he was doing so.  Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew the victim was a police officer and testimony indicating that Clark had previously stated he wanted to shoot police and had lured the victim to the scene to kill him.  In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.  First, he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear and convincing evidence that, in the words of another state statute, \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the [crime, he] was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the requisite <em>mens rea, </em>that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to kill an officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ruling that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on insanity to dispute the <em>mens rea,</em> the trial court cited the Arizona Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mott,</em> 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d 1046, which refused to allow psychiatric testimony to negate specific intent and held that Arizona does not allow evidence of a mental disorder short of insanity to negate the <em>mens rea</em> element of a crime<em>.  </em>As to his insanity, then, Clark presented lay testimony describing his increasingly bizarre behavior over the year before the shooting.  Other lay and expert testimony indicated, among other things, that Clark thought that \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d (some impersonating government agents) were trying to kill him and that bullets were the only way to stop them.  A psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia with delusions about \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d when he killed the officer, and concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer or understanding right from wrong and was thus insane at the time of the killing.  In rebuttal, the State\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrist gave his opinion that Clark\xe2\x80\x99s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct before and after the shooting.  The judge then issued a first-degree murder verdict, finding that in light of that the facts of the crime, the expert evaluations, Clark\xe2\x80\x99s actions and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the observations of those who knew him, Clark had not established that his schizophrenia distorted his perception of reality so severely that he did not know his actions were wrong.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark moved to vacate the judgment and life sentence, arguing, among other things, that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s insanity test and its <em>Mott </em>rule each violate due process.  He claimed that the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed its insanity standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first of the two parts of the traditional <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> insanity test.  The trial court denied the motion.  Affirming, the Arizona Court of Appeals held, among other things<em>,</em> that the State\xe2\x80\x99s insanity scheme was consistent with due process.  The court read <em>Mott </em>as barring the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of evidence of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness and capacity directly on the element of <em>mens rea</em>.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Due process does not prohibit Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s use of an insanity test stated solely in terms of the capacity to tell whether an act charged as a crime was right or wrong.

The second part presents an ostensibly alternative basis for recognizing a defense of insanity understood as a lack of moral capacity: whether a mental disease or defect leaves a defendant unable to understand that his action was wrong.  Although the Arizona Legislature at first adopted the full <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>statement, it later dropped the cognitive incapacity part.  Under current Arizona law, a defendant will not be adjudged insane unless he demonstrates that at the time of the crime, he was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that he did not know the criminal act was wrong.

S. 197</a>, 202.  The claim entails no light burden, and Clark does not carry it.  History shows no deference to <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> that could elevate its formula to the level of fundamental principle, so as to limit the traditional recognition of a State\xe2\x80\x99s capacity to define crimes and defenses.  See, <em>e.g., Patterson, supra, </em>at 210.  Even a cursory examination of the traditional Anglo-American approaches to insanity reveals significant differences among them, with four traditional strains variously combined to yield a diversity of American standards.  Although 17 States and the Federal Government have adopted recognizable versions of the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> test with both its components, other States have adopted a variety of standards based on all or part of one or more of four variants.  The alternatives are multiplied further by variations in the prescribed insanity verdict.  This varied background makes clear that no particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process, and that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal offenses, is substantially open to state choice.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Nor does Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s abbreviation of the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>statement raise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been shortchanged.  Although Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s former statement of the full <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>rule was constitutionally adequate, the abbreviated rule is no less so, for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it was under the more extended formulation, and evidence going to cognitive incapacity has the same significance under the short form as it had under the long.  Though Clark is correct that applying the moral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not necessarily require evaluation of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s cognitive capacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him, his argument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is itself enough to demonstrate moral incapacity, so that evidence bearing on whether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions is both relevant and admissible.  In practical terms, if a defendant did not know what he was doing when he acted, he could not have known that he was performing the wrongful act charged as a crime.  The Arizona appeals court acknowledged as much in this case.  Clark adopted this very analysis in the trial court, which apparently agreed when it admitted his cognitive incapacity evidence for consideration under the State\xe2\x80\x99s moral incapacity formulation.  Clark can point to no evidence bearing on insanity that was excluded.

Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9338.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Mott </em>held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental incapacity owing to mental disease or defect was admissible, and could be considered, only for its bearing on an insanity defense, but could not be considered on the element of <em>mens rea</em>.  Of the three categories of evidence that potentially bear on <em>mens rea\xe2\x80\x94</em>(1) everyday \xe2\x80\x9cobservation evidence\xe2\x80\x9d either by lay or expert witnesses of what Clark did or said, which may support the professional diagnoses of disease and in any event is the kind of evidence that can be relevant to show what was on Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mind when he fired his gun; (2) \xe2\x80\x9cmental-disease evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d typically from professional psychologists or psychiatrists based on factual reports, professional observations, and tests about Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental disease, with features described by the witness; and (3) \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d typically by the same experts, about Clark\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form <em>mens rea</em>)\xe2\x80\x94<em>Mott</em> imposed no restriction on considering evidence of the first sort, but applies to the latter two.  Although the trial court seems to have applied the <em>Mott</em> restriction to all three categories of evidence Clark offered for the purpose of showing what he called his inability to form the required <em>mens rea</em>, his objection to <em>Mott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s application does not turn on the distinction between lay and expert witnesses or the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.  Rather, the issue here is Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the <em>Mott </em>rule violates due process.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Clark\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Mott</em> challenge turns on the application of the presumption of innocence in criminal cases, the presumption of sanity, and the principle that a criminal defendant is entitled to present relevant and favorable evidence on an element of the offense charged against him.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The presumption of innocence is that a defendant is innocent unless and until the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt each element of the offense changed, including the mental element or <em>mens rea</em>.  The modern tendency is to describe the <em>mens rea </em>required to prove particular offenses in specific terms, as shown in the Arizona statute requiring the State to prove that in acting to kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on duty or knew that the victim was such an officer on duty.  As applied to <em>mens rea</em> (and every other element), the force of the presumption of innocence is measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind was in fact what the charge states.  See <em>In re Winship</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/index.html">397 U. S. 358</a>, 361\xe2\x80\x93363.  Pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0The presumption of sanity dispenses with a requirement that the government include as an element of every criminal charge an allegation that the defendant had the capacity to form the <em>mens rea</em> necessary for conviction and criminal responsibility.  Unlike the presumption of innocence, the presumption of sanity\xe2\x80\x99s force varies across the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior law has recognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative branch in defining the presumption\xe2\x80\x99s strength through the kind of evidence and degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see <em>Fisher</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/463/index.html">328 U. S. 463</a>, 466\xe2\x80\x93476.  There are two points where the sanity or capacity presumption may be placed in issue.  First, a State may allow a defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evidence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it can have on the government\xe2\x80\x99s burden to show <em>mens rea</em>.  Second, the sanity presumption\xe2\x80\x99s force may be tested in the consideration of an insanity defense raised by a defendant.  Insanity rules like <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> and the variants noted above are attempts to define or indicate the kinds of mental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal responsibility, see, <em>e.g., Jones</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/354/index.html">463 U. S. 354</a>, 373, n.\xc2\xa04, even if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the presumption of innocence by convincing the factfinder of all the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  The burden a defendant raising the insanity issue must carry defines the strength of the sanity presumption.  A State may, for example, place the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a preponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Leland </em>v. <em>Oregon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/790/index.html">343 U. S. 790</a>, 798.  Pp.\xc2\xa026\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(iii)\xc2\xa0A defendant has a due process right to present evidence favorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict him.  Evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental disease and lacks capacity to form <em>mens rea</em> is relevant to rebut evidence that he did in fact form the required <em>mens rea</em> at the time in question.  Thus, Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending to show <em>mens rea</em>, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.  However, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason for doing so.  For example, trial judges may \xe2\x80\x9cexclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>South Carolina,</em> 547 U. S. ___, ___.  And if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be subject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.  Under state law, mental-disease and capacity evidence may be considered only for its bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s burden as defined by the terms of that defense.  Such evidence is thus being channeled or restricted to one issue; it is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted satisfy due process\xe2\x80\x99s fundamental fairness standard.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The reasons supporting the Arizona rule satisfy due process.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9338. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0The first such reason is Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s authority to define its presumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an insanity definition and placing the burden of persuasion on criminal defendants claiming incapacity as an excuse.  Consistent with due process, a State can require defendants to bear that burden, see <em>Leland, supra,</em> at 797\xe2\x80\x93799, and Clark does not object to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s decision to require persuasion to a clear and convincing degree before the presumption of sanity and normal responsibility is overcome.  If a State is to have this authority in practice as well as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the sanity presumption more easily when addressing a different issue during the criminal trial.  Yet just such an opportunity would be available if expert testimony of mental disease and incapacity could be considered for whatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the <em>mens rea </em>issue.  The sanity presumption would then be only as strong as the evidence a factfinder would accept as enough to raise a reasonable doubt about <em>mens rea</em>; once reasonable doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the standards established for the insanity defense would go by the boards.  What counts for due process is simply that a State wishing to avoid a second avenue for exploring capacity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the consideration of mental disease and incapacity evidence to the insanity defense.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9332.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rule also serves to avoid confusion and misunderstanding on the part of jurors.  The controversial character of some categories of mental disease, the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead, and the danger of according greater certainty to capacity evidence than experts claim for it give rise to risks that may reasonably be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence to the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defendant has the burden of persuasion.  First, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate within the psychiatric profession about the very contours of the mental disease itself.  See, <em>e.g., Jones, supra,</em> at 364\xe2\x80\x93365, n.\xc2\xa013.  Though mental-disease evidence is certainly not condemned wholesale, the consequence of this professional ferment is a general caution in treating psychological classifications as predicates for excusing otherwise criminal conduct.  Next, there is the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead jurors (when they are the factfinders) through the power of this kind of evidence to suggest that a defendant suffering from a recognized mental disease lacks cognitive, moral, volitional, or other capacity, when that may not be a sound conclusion at all.  Even when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the classification may suggest something very significant about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity, when in fact the classification tells little or nothing about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to form <em>mens rea</em> or to exercise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that define legal sanity.  The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they reach opposite conclusions on whether his mental disease left him bereft of cognitive or moral capacity.  Finally, there are particular risks inherent in the opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease rendered a particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary for moral judgment or <em>mens rea</em> or otherwise incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of the conduct charged.  Unlike observational evidence bearing on <em>mens rea</em>, capacity evidence consists of judgment, and judgment is fraught with multiple perils.  Although such capacity judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense expert in this very case.  He testified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to understand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, but he admitted that no one knew exactly what was on Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mind at the time of the shooting.  Even when an expert is confident that his understanding of the mind is reliable, judgment addressing the basic categories of capacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are devised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility.

We hold that there is no violation of due process in either instance.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the early hours of June 21, 2000, Officer Jeffrey Moritz of the Flagstaff Police responded in uniform to complaints that a pickup truck with loud music blaring was circling a residential block.  When he located the truck, the officer turned on the emergency lights and siren of his marked patrol car, which prompted petitioner Eric Clark, the truck\xe2\x80\x99s driver (then 17), to pull over.  Officer Moritz got out of the patrol car and told Clark to stay where he was.  Less than a minute later, Clark shot the officer, who died soon after but not before calling the police dispatcher for help.  Clark ran away on foot but was arrested later that day with gunpowder residue on his hands; the gun that killed the officer was found nearby, stuffed into a knit cap.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark was charged with first-degree murder under Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x931105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005) for intentionally or knowingly killing a law enforcement officer in the line of duty.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In March 2001, Clark was found incompetent to stand trial and was committed to a state hospital for treatment, but two years later the same trial court found his competence restored and ordered him to be tried.  Clark waived his right to a jury, and the case was heard by the court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At trial, Clark did not contest the shooting and death, but relied on his undisputed paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the incident in denying that he had the specific intent to shoot a law enforcement officer or knowledge that he was doing so, as required by the statute.  Accordingly, the prosecutor offered circumstantial evidence that Clark knew Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer.  The evidence showed that the officer was in uniform at the time, that he caught up with Clark in a marked police car with emergency lights and siren going, and that Clark acknowledged the symbols of police authority and stopped.  The testimony for the prosecution indicated that Clark had intentionally lured an officer to the scene to kill him, having told some people a few weeks before the incident that he wanted to shoot police officers.  At the close of the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, the trial court denied Clark\xe2\x80\x99s motion for judgment of acquittal for failure to prove intent to kill a law enforcement officer or knowledge that Officer Moritz was a law enforcement officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In presenting the defense case, Clark claimed mental illness, which he sought to introduce for two purposes.  First, he raised the affirmative defense of insanity, putting the burden on himself to prove by clear and convincing evidence, \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93502(C) (West 2001), that \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the commission of the criminal act [he] was afflicted with a mental disease or defect of such severity that [he] did not know the criminal act was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93502(A).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Second, he aimed to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of the requisite <em>mens rea</em>, that he had acted intentionally or knowingly to kill a law enforcement officer.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Record in No. CR 2000\xe2\x80\x93538 (Ariz. Super. Ct.), Doc. 374 (hereinafter Record).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court ruled that Clark could not rely on evidence bearing on insanity to dispute the <em>mens rea</em>.  The court cited <em>State </em>v. <em>Mott</em>, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d 1046 (en banc), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1234/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/1234/index.html">520 U.

Witnesses testified, for example, that paranoid delusions led Clark to rig a fishing line with beads and wind chimes at home to alert him to intrusion by invaders, and to keep a bird in his automobile to warn of airborne poison.  There was lay and expert testimony that Clark thought Flagstaff was populated with \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d (some impersonating government agents), the \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d were trying to kill him, and bullets were the only way to stop them.  A psychiatrist testified that Clark was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia with delusions about \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d when he killed Officer Moritz, and he concluded that Clark was incapable of luring the officer or understanding right from wrong and that he was thus insane at the time of the killing.  In rebuttal, a psychiatrist for the State gave his opinion that Clark\xe2\x80\x99s paranoid schizophrenia did not keep him from appreciating the wrongfulness of his conduct, as shown by his actions before and after the shooting (such as circling the residential block with music blaring as if to lure the police to intervene, evading the police after the shooting, and hiding the gun).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the close of the defense case consisting of this evidence bearing on mental illness, the trial court denied Clark\xe2\x80\x99s renewed motion for a directed verdict grounded on failure of the prosecution to show that Clark knew the victim was a police officer.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The judge then issued a special verdict of first-degree murder, expressly finding that Clark shot and caused the death of Officer Moritz beyond a reasonable doubt and that Clark had not shown that he was insane at the time.  The judge noted that though Clark was indisputably afflicted with paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the shooting, the mental illness \xe2\x80\x9cdid not \xe2\x80\xa6 distort his perception of reality so severely that he did not know his actions were wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 334.  For this conclusion, the judge expressly relied on \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts of the crime, the evaluations of the experts, [Clark\xe2\x80\x99s] actions and behavior both before and after the shooting, and the observations of those that knew [Clark].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 333.  The sentence was life imprisonment without the possibility of release for 25 years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark moved to vacate the judgment and sentence, arguing, among other things<em>,</em> that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s insanity test and its <em>Mott </em>rule each violate due process.  As to the insanity standard, Clark claimed (as he had argued earlier) that the Arizona Legislature had impermissibly narrowed its standard in 1993 when it eliminated the first part of the two-part insanity test announced in <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 10 Cl. &amp; Fin. 200, 8 Eng. Rep. 718 (1843).  The court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals of Arizona affirmed Clark\xe2\x80\x99s conviction, treating the conclusion on sanity as supported by enough evidence to withstand review for abuse of discretion, and holding the State\xe2\x80\x99s insanity scheme consistent with due process.  App. 336.  As to the latter, the Court of Appeals reasoned that there is no constitutional requirement to recognize an insanity defense at all, the bounds of which are left to the State\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  Beyond that, the appellate court followed <em>Mott</em>, reading it as barring the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of evidence of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness and capacity directly on the element of <em>mens rea</em>.  The Supreme Court of Arizona denied further review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to decide whether due process prohibits Arizona from thus narrowing its insanity test or from excluding evidence of mental illness and incapacity due to mental illness to rebut evidence of the requisite criminal intent.  546 U.

The main variants are the cognitive incapacity, the moral incapacity, the volitional incapacity, and the product-of-mental-illness tests.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The first two emanate from the alternatives stated in the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>rule.  The volitional incapacity or irresistible-impulse test, which surfaced over two centuries ago (first in England,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] then in this country[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]), asks whether a person was so lacking in volition due to a mental defect or illness that he could not have controlled his actions.  And the product-of-mental-illness test was used as early as 1870,[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and simply asks whether a person\xe2\x80\x99s action was a product of a mental disease or defect.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Seventeen States and the Federal Government have adopted a recognizable version of the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> test with both its cognitive incapacity and moral incapacity components.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  One State has adopted only <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em>\xe2\x80\x99s cognitive incapacity test,[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and 10 (including Arizona) have adopted the moral incapacity test alone.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Fourteen jurisdictions, inspired by the Model Penal Code,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] have in place an amalgam of the volitional incapacity test and some variant of the moral incapacity test, satisfaction of either (generally by showing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial lack of capacity) being enough to excuse.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Three States combine a full <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>test with a volitional incapacity formula.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  And New Hampshire alone stands by the product-of-mental-illness test.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The alternatives are multiplied further by variations in the prescribed insanity verdict: a significant number of these jurisdictions supplement the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cnot guilty by reason of insanity\xe2\x80\x9d verdict with an alternative of \xe2\x80\x9cguilty but mentally ill.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Finally, four States have no affirmative insanity defense,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] though one provides for a \xe2\x80\x9cguilty and mentally ill\xe2\x80\x9d verdict.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  These four, like a number of others that recognize an affirmative insanity defense, allow consideration of evidence of mental illness directly on the element of <em>mens rea</em> defining the offense.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With this varied background, it is clear that no particular formulation has evolved into a baseline for due process, and that the insanity rule, like the conceptualization of criminal offenses, is substantially open to state choice.  Indeed, the legitimacy of such choice is the more obvious when one considers the interplay of legal concepts of mental illness or deficiency required for an insanity defense, with the medical concepts of mental abnormality that influence the expert opinion testimony by psychologists and psychiatrists commonly introduced to support or contest insanity claims.  For medical definitions devised to justify treatment, like legal ones devised to excuse from conventional criminal responsibility, are subject to flux and disagreement.  See <em>infra</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9333; cf. <em>Leland,</em> 343 U. S., at 800\xe2\x80\x93801 (no due process violation for adopting the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> standard rather than the irresistible-impulse test because scientific knowledge does not require otherwise and choice of test is a matter of policy).  There being such fodder for reasonable debate about what the cognate legal and medical tests should be, due process imposes no single canonical formulation of legal insanity.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s abbreviation of the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>statement raise a proper claim that some constitutional minimum has been shortchanged.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s argument of course assumes that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s former statement of the <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>rule, with its express alternative of cognitive incapacity, was constitutionally adequate (as we agree).  That being so, the abbreviated rule is no less so, for cognitive incapacity is relevant under that statement, just as it was under the more extended formulation, and evidence going to cognitive incapacity has the same significance under the short form as it had under the long.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though Clark is correct that the application of the moral incapacity test (telling right from wrong) does not necessarily require evaluation of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s cognitive capacity to appreciate the nature and quality of the acts charged against him, see Brief for Petitioner 46\xe2\x80\x9347, his argument fails to recognize that cognitive incapacity is itself enough to demonstrate moral incapacity.  Cognitive incapacity, in other words, is a sufficient condition for establishing a defense of insanity, albeit not a necessary one.  As a defendant can therefore make out moral incapacity by demonstrating cognitive incapacity, evidence bearing on whether the defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions is both relevant and admissible.  In practical terms, if a defendant did not know what he was doing when he acted, he could not have known that he was performing the wrongful act charged as a crime.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Indeed, when the two-part rule was still in effect, the Supreme Court of Arizona held that a jury instruction on insanity containing the moral incapacity part but not a full recitation of the cognitive incapacity part was fine, as the cognitive incapacity part might be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98treated as adding nothing to the requirement that the accused know his act was wrong.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v. <em>Chavez</em>, 143 Ariz. 238, 239, 693 P.\xc2\xa02d 893, 894 (1984) (quoting A. Goldstein, The Insanity Defense 50 (1967)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals of Arizona acknowledged as much in this case, too, see App. 350 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to imagine that a defendant who did not appreciate the \xe2\x80\x98nature and quality\xe2\x80\x99 of the act he committed would reasonably be able to perceive that the act was \xe2\x80\x98wrong\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), and thus aligned itself with the long-accepted understanding that the cognitively incapacitated are a subset of the morally incapacitated within the meaning of the standard <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>rule, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Goldstein, <em>supra</em>, at 51 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn those situations where the accused does not know the nature and quality of his act, in the broad sense, he will not know that it was wrong, no matter what construction \xe2\x80\x98wrong\xe2\x80\x99 is given\xe2\x80\x9d); 1 W.

The trial court apparently agreed, for the judge admitted Clark\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of cognitive incapacity for consideration under the State\xe2\x80\x99s moral incapacity formulation.  And Clark can point to no evidence bearing on insanity that was excluded.  His psychiatric expert and a number of lay witnesses testified to his delusions, and this evidence tended to support a description of Clark as lacking the capacity to understand that the police officer was a human being.  There is no doubt that the trial judge considered the evidence as going to an issue of cognitive capacity, for in finding insanity not proven he said that Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness \xe2\x80\x9cdid not \xe2\x80\xa6 distort his perception of reality so severely that he did not know his actions were wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 334.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are satisfied that neither in theory nor in practice did Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 abridgment of the insanity formulation deprive Clark of due process.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark\xe2\x80\x99s second claim of a due process violation challenges the rule adopted by the Supreme Court of Arizona in <em>State </em>v. <em>Mott</em>, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d 1046 (en banc), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1234/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/1234/index.html">520 U.

This case ruled on the admissibility of testimony from a psychologist offered to show that the defendant suffered from battered women\xe2\x80\x99s syndrome and therefore lacked the capacity to form the <em>mens rea </em>of the crime charged against her.  The opinion variously referred to the testimony in issue as \xe2\x80\x9cpsychological testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d 187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1051, and \xe2\x80\x9cexpert testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and implicitly equated it with \xe2\x80\x9cexpert psychiatric evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 540, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1050 (internal quotation marks omitted), and \xe2\x80\x9cpsychiatric testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 541, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1051.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]   The state court held that testimony of a professional psychologist or psychiatrist about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental incapacity owing to mental disease or defect was admissible, and could be considered, only for its bearing on an insanity defense; such evidence could not be considered on the element of <em>mens rea</em>, that is, what the State must show about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental state (such as intent or understanding) when he performed the act charged against him.  See <em>id.</em>, at 541, 544, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1051, 1054.[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Understanding Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim requires attention to the categories of evidence with a potential bearing on <em>mens rea</em>.  First, there is \xe2\x80\x9cobservation evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the everyday sense, testimony from those who observed what Clark did and heard what he said; this category would also include testimony that an expert witness might give about Clark\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to think in a certain way and his behavioral characteristics.  This evidence may support a professional diagnosis of mental disease and in any event is the kind of evidence that can be relevant to show what in fact was on Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mind when he fired the gun.  Observation evidence in the record covers Clark\xe2\x80\x99s behavior at home and with friends, his expressions of belief around the time of the killing that \xe2\x80\x9caliens\xe2\x80\x9d were inhabiting the bodies of local people (including government agents),[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] his driving around the neighborhood before the police arrived, and so on.  Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, see <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Kennedy, J.), observation evidence can be presented by either lay or expert witnesses.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, there is \xe2\x80\x9cmental-disease evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of opinion testimony that Clark suffered from a mental disease with features described by the witness.  As was true here, this evidence characteristically but not always[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  comes from professional psychologists or psychiatrists who testify as expert witnesses and base their opinions in part on examination of a defendant, usually conducted after the events in question.  The thrust of this evidence was that, based on factual reports, professional observations, and tests, Clark was psychotic at the time in question, with a condition that fell within the category of schizophrenia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there is evidence we will refer to as \xe2\x80\x9ccapacity evidence\xe2\x80\x9d about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity for cognition and moral judgment (and ultimately also his capacity to form <em>mens rea</em>).  This, too, is opinion evidence.  Here, as it usually does,[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>] this testimony came from the same experts and concentrated on those specific details of the mental condition that make the difference between sanity and insanity under the Arizona definition.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  In their respective testimony on these details the experts disagreed: the defense expert gave his opinion that the symptoms or effects of the disease in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s case included inability to appreciate the nature of his action and to tell that it was wrong, whereas the State\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatrist was of the view that Clark was a schizophrenic who was still sufficiently able to appreciate the reality of shooting the officer and to know that it was wrong to do that.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A caveat about these categories is in order.  They attempt to identify different kinds of testimony offered in this case in terms of explicit and implicit distinctions made in <em>Mott</em>.  What we can say about these categories goes to their cores, however, not their margins.  Exact limits have thus not been worked out in any Arizona law that has come to our attention, and in this case, neither the courts in their rulings nor counsel in objections invoked or required precision in applying the <em>Mott</em> rule\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary treatment, as we explain below.  Necessarily, then, our own decision can address only core issues, leaving for other cases any due process claims that may be raised about the treatment of evidence whose categorization is subject to dispute.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear that <em>Mott</em> itself imposed no restriction on considering evidence of the first sort, the observation evidence.  We read the <em>Mott </em>restriction to apply, rather, to evidence addressing the two issues in testimony that characteristically comes only from psychologists or psychiatrists qualified to give opinions as expert witnesses: mental-disease evidence (whether at the time of the crime a defendant suffered from a mental disease or defect, such as schizophrenia) and capacity evidence (whether the disease or defect left him incapable of performing or experiencing a mental process defined as necessary for sanity such as appreciating the nature and quality of his act and knowing that it was wrong).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Mott </em>was careful to distinguish this kind of opinion evidence from observation evidence generally and even from observation evidence that an expert witness might offer, such as descriptions of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to think in a certain way or his behavioral characteristics; the Arizona court made it clear that this sort of testimony was perfectly admissible to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of <em>mens rea</em>, 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1054.  Thus, only opinion testimony going to mental defect or disease, and its effect on the cognitive or moral capaci-\nties on which sanity depends under the Arizona rule, is restricted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the trial court seems to have applied the <em>Mott</em> restriction to all evidence offered by Clark for the purpose of showing what he called his inability to form the required <em>mens rea</em>, see, <em>e.g.</em>, Record, Doc. 406, pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310, (that is, an intent to kill a police officer on duty, or an understanding that he was engaging in the act of killing such an officer, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x931105(A)(3) (West Supp. 2005)).  Thus, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s restriction may have covered not only mental-disease and capacity evidence as just defined, but also observation evidence offered by lay (and expert) witnesses who described Clark\xe2\x80\x99s unusual behavior.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the application of the <em>Mott</em> rule does not, however, turn on the distinction between lay and expert witnesses or the kinds of testimony they were competent to present.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is some, albeit limited, disagreement between the dissent and ourselves about the scope of the claim of error properly before us.  To start with matters of agreement, all Members of the Court agree that Clark\xe2\x80\x99s general attack on the <em>Mott </em>rule covers its application in confining consideration of capacity evidence to the insanity defense.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In practical terms, our agreement on issues presented extends to a second point.  Justice Kennedy understands that Clark raised an objection to confining mental-disease evidence to the insanity issue.  As he sees it, Clark in effect claimed that in dealing with the issue of <em>mens rea</em> the trial judge should have considered expert testimony on what may characteristically go through the mind of a schizophrenic, when the judge considered what in fact was in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mind at the time of the shooting.  See <em>post</em>, at 3 (dissenting opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he opinion that Clark had paranoid schizophrenia\xe2\x80\x94an opinion shared by experts for both the prosecution and defense\xe2\x80\x94bears on efforts to determine, as a factual matter, whether he knew he was killing a police officer\xe2\x80\x9d).  He thus understands that defense counsel claimed a right to rebut the State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em> demonstration with testimony about how schizophrenics may hallucinate voices and other sounds, about their characteristic failure to distinguish the content of their imagination from what most people perceive as exterior reality, and so on.  It is important to be clear that this supposed objection was not about dealing with testimony based on observation of Clark showing that he had auditory hallucinations when he was driving around, or failed in fact to appreciate objective reality when he shot; this objection went to use of testimony about schizophrenics, not about Clark in particular.  While we might dispute how clearly Clark raised this objection, we have no doubt that the objection falls within a general challenge to the <em>Mott </em>rule; we understand that <em>Mott</em> is meant to confine to the insanity defense any consideration of characteristic behavior associated with mental disease, see 187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1054 (contrasting <em>State </em>v. <em>Christensen</em>, 129 Ariz. 32, 628 P.\xc2\xa02d 580 (1991), and <em>State </em>v. <em>Gonzales</em>, 140 Ariz. 349, 681 P.\xc2\xa02d 1368 (1984)).  We will therefore assume for argument that Clark raised this claim, as we consider the due process challenge to the <em>Mott </em>rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The point on which we disagree with the dissent, however, is this: did Clark apprise the Arizona courts that he believed the trial judge had erroneously limited the consideration of observation evidence, whether from lay witnesses like Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mother or (possibly) the expert witnesses who observed him?  This sort of evidence was not covered by the <em>Mott </em>restriction, and confining it to the insanity issue would have been an erroneous application of <em>Mott</em> as a matter of Arizona law.  For the following reasons we think no such objection was made in a way the Arizona courts could have understood it, and that no such issue is before us now.  We think the only issue properly before us is the challenge to <em>Mott </em>on due process grounds, comprising objections to limits on the use of mental-disease and capacity evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear that the trial judge intended to apply <em>Mott:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ecognizing that much of the evidence that [the defense is] going to be submitting, in fact all of it, as far as I know \xe2\x80\xa6 that has to do with the insanity could also arguably be made along the lines of the Mott issue as to form and intent and his capacity for the intent.  I\xe2\x80\x99m going to let you go ahead and get all that stuff in because it goes to the insanity issue and because we\xe2\x80\x99re not in front of a jury.  At the end, I\xe2\x80\x99ll let you make an offer of proof as to the intent, the Mott issues, but I still think the supreme court decision is the law of the land in this state.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 9.</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At no point did the trial judge specify any particular evidence that he refused to consider on the mens rea</em> issue.  Nor did defense counsel specify any observation or other particular evidence that he claimed was admissible but wrongly excluded on the issue of <em>mens rea</em>, so as to produce a clearer ruling on what evidence was being restricted on the authority of <em>Mott</em> and what was not.  He made no \xe2\x80\x9coffer of proof\xe2\x80\x9d in the trial court;[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>] and although his brief in the Arizona Court of Appeals stated at one point that it was not inconsistent with <em>Mott</em> to consider nonexpert evidence indicating mental illness on the issue of <em>mens rea</em>, and argued that the trial judge had failed to do so, Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief in No. 1CA\xe2\x80\x93CR\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x930851 etc. (Ariz.

Similarly, we read the Arizona Court of Appeals to have done nothing more than rely on <em>Mott </em>to reject the claim that due process forbids restricting evidence bearing on \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]bility to [f]orm [m]ens [r]ea</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 351 (emphasis in original), (<em>i.e.</em>, mental-disease and capacity evidence) to the insanity determination.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief 46, 47, 51; Brief for Petitioner 11, 13, 16, 20\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, with its uncertain edges, may have restricted observation evidence admissible on <em>mens rea</em> to the insanity defense alone, but we cannot be sure.[<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  But because a due process challenge to such a restriction of observation evidence was, by our measure, neither pressed nor passed upon in the Arizona Court of Appeals, we do not consider it.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kentucky</em> v. <em>Stincer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/730/index.html">482 U. S. 730</a>, 747, n. 22 (1987); <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Gates,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/213/index.html">462 U. S. 213</a>, 217\xe2\x80\x93224 (1983).  What we do know, and now consider, is Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim that <em>Mott</em> denied due process because it \xe2\x80\x9c<em>preclude[d] Eric from contending that \xe2\x80\xa6 factual inferences</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>of the \xe2\x80\x9cmental states which were necessary elements of the crime charged\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c<em>should not be drawn</em> because the behavior was explainable, instead, as a manifestation of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 13 (emphasis in original).

S., at 210\xe2\x80\x93211; <em>In re Winship,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/index.html">397 U. S. 358</a>, 361\xe2\x80\x93364 (1970), including the mental element or <em>mens rea</em>.  Before the last century, the <em>mens rea </em>required to be proven for particular offenses was often described in general terms like \xe2\x80\x9cmalice,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>In\xc2\xa0re Eckart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/166/481/index.html">166 U.

Blackstone, Commentaries *21 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n unwarrantable act without a vicious will is no crime at all\xe2\x80\x9d), but the modern tendency has been toward more specific descriptions, as shown in the Arizona statute defining the murder charged against Clark: the State had to prove that in acting to kill the victim, Clark intended to kill a law enforcement officer on duty or knew that the victim was such an officer on duty.  See generally Gardner, The <em>Mens Rea </em>Enigma: Observations on the Role of Motive in the Criminal Law Past and Present, 1993 Utah L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 635.  As applied to <em>mens rea</em> (and every other element), the force of the presumption of innocence is measured by the force of the showing needed to overcome it, which is proof beyond a reasonable doubt that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind was in fact what the charge states.  See <em>Winship</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 361\xe2\x80\x93363.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The presumption of sanity is equally universal in some variety or other, being (at least) a presumption that a defendant has the capacity to form the <em>mens rea</em> necessary for a verdict of guilt and the consequent criminal responsibility.  See <em>Leland</em>, 343 U. S., at 799; <em>Davis</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/160/469/index.html">160 U. S. 469</a>, 486\xe2\x80\x93487 (1895); <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 10 Cl. &amp; Fin., at 210, 8 Eng. Rep., at 722; see generally 1 LaFave, Substantive Criminal Law \xc2\xa78.3(a), at 598\xe2\x80\x93599, and n.\xc2\xa01.  This presumption dispenses with a requirement on the government\xe2\x80\x99s part to include as an element of every criminal charge an allegation that the defendant had such a capacity.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  The force of this presumption, like the presumption of innocence, is measured by the quantum of evidence necessary to overcome it; unlike the presumption of innocence, however, the force of the presumption of sanity varies across the many state and federal jurisdictions, and prior law has recognized considerable leeway on the part of the legislative branch in defining the presumption\xe2\x80\x99s strength through the kind of evidence and degree of persuasiveness necessary to overcome it, see <em>Fisher</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/463/index.html"></a><a href="/us/328/463/index.html">328 U. S. 463</a>, 466\xe2\x80\x93476 (1946).[<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two points where the sanity or capacity presumption may be placed in issue.  First, a State may allow a defendant to introduce (and a factfinder to consider) evidence of mental disease or incapacity for the bearing it can have on the government\xe2\x80\x99s burden to show <em>mens rea</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>State </em>v. <em>Perez</em>, 882 A.\xc2\xa02d 574, 584 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2005).[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  In such States the evidence showing incapacity to form the guilty state of mind, for example, qualifies the probative force of other evidence, which considered alone indicates that the defendant actually formed the guilty state of mind.  If it is shown that a defendant with mental disease thinks all blond people are robots, he could not have intended to kill a person when he shot a man with blond hair, even though he seemed to act like a man shooting another man.[<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  In jurisdictions that allow mental-disease and capacity evidence to be considered on par with any other relevant evidence when deciding whether the prosecution has proven <em>mens rea</em> beyond a reasonable doubt, the evidence of mental disease or incapacity need only support what the factfinder regards as a reasonable doubt about the capacity to form (or the actual formation of) the <em>mens rea</em>, in order to require acquittal of the charge.  Thus, in these States the strength of the presumption of sanity is no greater than the strength of the evidence of abnormal mental state that the factfinder thinks is enough to raise a reasonable doubt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second point where the force of the presumption of sanity may be tested is in the consideration of a defense of insanity raised by a defendant.  Insanity rules like <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> and the variants discussed in Part II, <em>supra</em>, are attempts to define, or at least to indicate, the kinds of mental differences that overcome the presumption of sanity or capacity and therefore excuse a defendant from customary criminal responsibility, see <em>Jones,</em> 463 U. S., at 373, n.\xc2\xa04 (Brennan, J., dissenting); D. Hermann, The Insanity Defense: Philosophical, Historical and Legal Perspectives 4 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cA central significance of the insanity defense \xe2\x80\xa6 is the separation of nonblameworthy from blameworthy offenders\xe2\x80\x9d), even if the prosecution has otherwise overcome the presumption of innocence by convincing the factfinder of all the elements charged beyond a reasonable doubt.  The burden that must be carried by a defendant who raises the insanity issue, again, defines the strength of the sanity presumption.  A State may provide, for example, that whenever the defendant raises a claim of insanity by some quantum of credible evidence, the presumption disappears and the government must prove sanity to a specified degree of certainty (whether beyond reasonable doubt or something less).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Keita</em>, 429 Mass. 843, 846, 712 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 65, 68 (1999).  Or a jurisdiction may place the burden of persuasion on a defendant to prove insanity as the applicable law defines it, whether by a preponderance of the evidence or to some more convincing degree, see Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93502(C) (West 2001); <em>Leland</em>, 343 U. S., at 798.  In any case, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s burden defines the presumption of sanity, whether that burden be to burst a bubble or to show something more. </p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third principle implicated by Clark\xe2\x80\x99s argument is a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right as a matter of simple due process to present evidence favorable to himself on an element that must be proven to convict him.[<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  As already noted, evidence tending to show that a defendant suffers from mental disease and lacks capacity to form <em>mens rea</em> is relevant to rebut evidence that he did in fact form the required <em>mens rea</em> at the time in question; this is the reason that Clark claims a right to require the factfinder in this case to consider testimony about his mental illness and his incapacity directly, when weighing the persuasiveness of other evidence tending to show <em>mens rea</em>, which the prosecution has the burden to prove.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Clark recognizes, however, the right to introduce relevant evidence can be curtailed if there is a good reason for doing that.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhile the Constitution \xe2\x80\xa6 prohibits the exclusion of defense evidence under rules that serve no legitimate purpose or that are disproportionate to the ends that they are asserted to promote, well-established rules of evidence permit trial judges to exclude evidence if its probative value is outweighed by certain other factors such as unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or potential to mislead the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d   <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>South Carolina,</em> 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 6); see <em>Crane</em> v. <em>Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/683/index.html">476 U. S. 683</a>, 689\xe2\x80\x93690 (1986) (permitting exclusion of evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cposes an undue risk of \xe2\x80\x98harassment, prejudice, [or] confusion of the issues\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Van Arsdall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/index.html">475 U. S. 673</a>, 679 (1986))); see also <em>Egelhoff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/518/37/index.html">518 U.

And if evidence may be kept out entirely, its consideration may be subject to limitation, which Arizona claims the power to impose here.  State law says that evidence of mental disease and incapacity may be introduced and considered, and if sufficiently forceful to satisfy the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof under the insanity rule it will displace the presumption of sanity and excuse from criminal responsibility.  But mental-disease and capacity evidence may be considered only for its bearing on the insanity defense, and it will avail a defendant only if it is persuasive enough to satisfy the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s burden as defined by the terms of that defense.  The mental-disease and capacity evidence is thus being channeled or restricted to one issue and given effect only if the defendant carries the burden to convince the factfinder of insanity; the evidence is not being excluded entirely, and the question is whether reasons for requiring it to be channeled and restricted are good enough to satisfy the standard of fundamental fairness that due process requires.  We think they are.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first reason supporting the <em>Mott</em> rule is Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s authority to define its presumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility) by choosing an insanity definition, as discussed in Part II, <em>supra</em>, and by placing the burden of persuasion on defendants who claim incapacity as an excuse from customary criminal responsibility.  No one, certainly not Clark here, denies that a State may place a burden of persuasion on a defendant claiming insanity, see <em>Leland, supra</em>, at 797\xe2\x80\x93799 (permitting a State, consistent with due process, to require the defendant to bear this burden).  And Clark presses no objection to Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s decision to require persuasion to a clear and convincing degree before the presumption of sanity and normal responsibility is overcome.  See Brief for Petitioner 18, n. 25.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But if a State is to have this authority in practice as well as in theory, it must be able to deny a defendant the opportunity to displace the presumption of sanity more easily when addressing a different issue in the course of the criminal trial.  Yet, as we have explained, just such an opportunity would be available if expert testimony of mental disease and incapacity could be considered for whatever a factfinder might think it was worth on the issue of <em>mens rea</em>.[<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  As we mentioned, the presumption of sanity would then be only as strong as the evidence a factfinder would accept as enough to raise a reasonable doubt about <em>mens rea</em> for the crime charged<em>;</em> once reasonable doubt was found, acquittal would be required, and the standards established for the defense of insanity would go by the boards.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now, a State is of course free to accept such a possibility in its law.  After all, it is free to define the insanity defense by treating the presumption of sanity as a bursting bubble, whose disappearance shifts the burden to the prosecution to prove sanity whenever a defendant presents any credible evidence of mental disease or incapacity.  In States with this kind of insanity rule, the legislature may well be willing to allow such evidence to be considered on the <em>mens rea </em>element for whatever the factfinder thinks it is worth.  What counts for due process, however, is simply that a State that wishes to avoid a second avenue for exploring capacity, less stringent for a defendant, has a good reason for confining the consideration of evidence of mental disease and incapacity to the insanity defense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is obvious that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Mott</em> rule reflects such a choice.  The State Supreme Court pointed out that the State had declined to adopt a defense of diminished capacity (allowing a jury to decide when to excuse a defendant because of greater than normal difficulty in conforming to the law).[<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  The court reasoned that the State\xe2\x80\x99s choice would be undercut if evidence of incapacity could be considered for whatever a jury might think sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt about <em>mens rea</em>, even if it did not show insanity.  187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1051.  In other words, if a jury were free to decide how much evidence of mental disease and incapacity was enough to counter evidence of <em>mens rea</em> to the point of creating a reasonable doubt, that would in functional terms be analogous to allowing jurors to decide upon some degree of diminished capacity to obey the law, a degree set by them, that would prevail as a stand-alone defense.[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A State\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on preserving its chosen standard of legal insanity cannot be the sole reason for a rule like <em>Mott</em>, however, for it fails to answer an objection the dissent makes in this case.  See <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9318 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  An insanity rule gives a defendant already found guilty the opportunity to excuse his conduct by showing he was insane when he acted, that is, that he did not have the mental capacity for conventional guilt and criminal responsibility.  But, as the dissent argues, if the same evidence that affirmatively shows he was not guilty by reason of insanity (or \xe2\x80\x9cguilty except insane\xe2\x80\x9d under Arizona law, Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93502(A) (West 2001)) also shows it was at least doubtful that he could form <em>mens rea</em>, then he should not be found guilty in the first place; it thus violates due process when the State impedes him from using mental-disease and capacity evidence directly to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence that he did form <em>mens rea</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Are there, then, characteristics of mental-disease and capacity evidence giving rise to risks that may reasonably be hedged by channeling the consideration of such evidence to the insanity issue on which, in States like Arizona, a defendant has the burden of persuasion?  We think there are: in the controversial character of some categories of mental disease, in the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead, and in the danger of according greater certainty to capacity evidence than experts claim for it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, the diagnosis may mask vigorous debate within the profession about the very contours of the mental disease itself.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders xxxiii (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (hereinafter DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV\xe2\x80\x93TR) (\xe2\x80\x9cDSM\xe2\x80\x93IV reflects a consensus about the classification and diagnosis of mental disorders derived at the time of its initial publication.  New knowledge generated by research or clinical experience will undoubtedly lead to an increased understanding of the disorders included in DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV, to the identification of new disorders, and to the removal of some disorders in future classifications.  The text and criteria sets included in DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV will require reconsideration in light of evolving new information\xe2\x80\x9d); P. Caplan, They Say You\xe2\x80\x99re Crazy: How the World\xe2\x80\x99s Most Powerful Psychiatrists Decide Who\xe2\x80\x99s Normal (1995) (criticism by former consultant to the DSM against some of the DSM\xe2\x80\x99s categories).  And Members of this Court have previously recognized that the end of such debate is not imminent.  See <em>Jones,</em> 463 U. S., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365, n. 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The only certain thing that can be said about the present state of knowledge and therapy regarding mental disease is that science has not reached finality of judgment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Greenwood</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/350/366/index.html">350 U.

Though we certainly do not \xe2\x80\x9ccondem[n mental-disease evidence] wholesale\xe2\x80\x9d, Brief for American Psychiatric Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15, the consequence of this professional ferment is a general caution in treating psychological classifications as predicates for excusing otherwise criminal conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, there is the potential of mental-disease evidence to mislead jurors (when they are the factfinders) through the power of this kind of evidence to suggest that a defendant suffering from a recognized mental disease lacks cognitive, moral, volitional, or other capacity, when that may not be a sound conclusion at all.  Even when a category of mental disease is broadly accepted and the assignment of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s behavior to that category is uncontroversial, the classification may suggest something very significant about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s capacity, when in fact the classification tells us little or nothing about the ability of the defendant to form <em>mens rea</em> or to exercise the cognitive, moral, or volitional capacities that define legal sanity.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  See DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV\xe2\x80\x93TR xxxii\xe2\x80\x93xxxiii (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV categories, criteria, and textual descriptions are employed for forensic purposes, there are significant risks that diagnostic information will be misused or misunderstood.  These dangers arise because of the imperfect fit between the questions of ultimate concern to the law and the information contained in a clinical diagnosis.  In most situations, the clinical diagnosis of a DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV mental disorder is not sufficient to establish the existence for legal purposes of \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98mental diseas[e]\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98mental defect.\xe2\x80\x99  In determining whether an individual meets a specified legal standard (e.g., for \xe2\x80\xa6 criminal responsibility \xe2\x80\xa6), additional information is usually required beyond that contained in the DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV diagnosis\xe2\x80\x9d).  The limits of the utility of a professional disease diagnosis are evident in the dispute between the two testifying experts in this case; they agree that Clark was schizophrenic, but they come to opposite conclusions on whether the mental disease in his particular case left him bereft of cognitive or moral capacity.  Evidence of mental disease, then, can easily mislead; it is very easy to slide from evidence that an individual with a professionally recognized mental disease is very different, into doubting that he has the capacity to form <em>mens rea</em>, whereas that doubt may not be justified.  And of course, in the cases mentioned before, in which the categorization is doubtful or the category of mental disease is itself subject to controversy, the risks are even greater that opinions about mental disease may confuse a jury into thinking the opinions show more than they do.  Because allowing mental-disease evidence on <em>mens rea</em> can thus easily mislead, it is not unreasonable to address that tendency by con-\nfining consideration of this kind of evidence to insanity,\non which a defendant may be assigned the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are, finally, particular risks inherent in the opinions of the experts who supplement the mental-disease classifications with opinions on incapacity: on whether the mental disease rendered a particular defendant incapable of the cognition necessary for moral judgment or <em>mens rea</em> or otherwise incapable of understanding the wrongfulness of the conduct charged.  Unlike observational evidence bearing on <em>mens rea</em>, capacity evidence consists of judgment, and judgment fraught with multiple perils: a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s state of mind at the crucial moment can be elusive no matter how conscientious the enquiry, and the law\xe2\x80\x99s categories that set the terms of the capacity judgment are not the categories of psychology that govern the expert\xe2\x80\x99s professional thinking.  Although such capacity judgments may be given in the utmost good faith, their potentially tenuous character is indicated by the candor of the defense expert in this very case.  Contrary to the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, he testified that Clark lacked the capacity to appreciate the circumstances realistically and to understand the wrongfulness of what he was doing, App. 48\xe2\x80\x9349, but he said that \xe2\x80\x9cno one knows exactly what was on [his] mind\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the shooting, <em>id.</em>, at 48.  And even when an expert is confident that his understanding of the mind is reliable, judgment addressing the basic categories of capacity requires a leap from the concepts of psychology, which are devised for thinking about treatment, to the concepts of legal sanity, which are devised for thinking about criminal responsibility.  See Insanity Defense Work Group, American Psychiatric Association Statement on the Insanity Defense, 140 Am. J. Psychiatry 681, 686 (1983), reprinted in 2 The Role of Mental Illness in Criminal Trials 117, 122 (J. Moriarty ed. 2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe American Psychiatric Association is not opposed to legislatures restricting psychiatric testimony about the \xe2\x80\xa6 ultimate legal issues concerning the insanity defense\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  When \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98ultimate issue\xe2\x80\x99 questions are formulated by the law and put to the expert witness who must then say \xe2\x80\x98yea\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98nay,\xe2\x80\x99 then the expert witness is required to make a leap in logic.  He no longer addresses himself to medical concepts but instead must infer or intuit what is in fact unspeakable, namely, the <em>probable relationship</em> between medical concepts and legal or moral constructs such as free will.  These impermissible leaps in logic made by expert witnesses confuse the jury\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  This state of affairs does considerable injustice to psychiatry and, we believe, possibly to criminal defendants.  These psychiatric disagreements \xe2\x80\xa6 cause less than fully understanding juries or the public to conclude that psychiatrists cannot agree.  In fact, in many criminal insanity trials both prosecution and defense psychiatrists do agree about the nature and even the extent of mental disorder exhibited by the defendant at the time of the act\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original; footnote omitted)); DSM\xe2\x80\x93IV\xe2\x80\x93TR xxxii\xe2\x80\x93xxxiii; P.

R. Slovenko, Psychiatry and Criminal Culpability 55 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe scope of the DSM is wide-ranging and includes \xe2\x80\x98conduct disorders\xe2\x80\x99 but \xe2\x80\x98evil\xe2\x80\x99 is not mentioned\xe2\x80\x9d).  In sum, these empirical and conceptual problems add up to a real risk that an expert\xe2\x80\x99s judgment in giving capacity evidence will come with an apparent authority that psychologists and psychiatrists do not claim to have.  We think that this risk, like the difficulty in assessing the significance of mental-disease evidence, supports the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to channel such expert testimony to consideration on the insanity defense, on which the party seeking the benefit of this evidence has the burden of persuasion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It bears repeating that not every State will find it worthwhile to make the judgment Arizona has made, and the choices the States do make about dealing with the risks posed by mental-disease and capacity evidence will reflect their varying assessments about the presumption of sanity as expressed in choices of insanity rules.[<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  The point here simply is that Arizona has sensible reasons\nto assign the risks as it has done by channeling the\nevidence.[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">F</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rule serves to preserve the State\xe2\x80\x99s chosen standard for recognizing insanity as a defense and to avoid confusion and misunderstanding on the part of jurors.[<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  For these reasons, there is no violation of due process under <em>Chambers</em> and its progeny, and no cause to claim that channeling evidence on mental disease and capacity offends any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98principle of justice so rooted in the traditions and conscience of our people as to be ranked as fundamental,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Patterson,</em> 432 U.

Sutherland, Statutes and Statutory Construction \xc2\xa74705 (3d ed. 1943).  Insanity standards are formulated to guide the factfinder to determine the blameworthiness of a mentally ill defendant.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/354/index.html">463 U. S. 354</a>, 373, n. 4 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  The <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten</em> test is a sequential test, first asking the factfinder to conduct the easier enquiry whether a defendant knew the nature and quality of his actions.  If not, the defendant is to be considered insane and there is no need to pass to the harder and broader enquiry whether the defendant knew his actions were wrong.  And, because, owing to this sequence, the factfinder is to ask whether a defendant lacks moral capacity only when he possesses cognitive capacity, the only defendants who will be found to lack moral capacity are those possessing cognitive capacity.  Cf. 2 C. Torcia, Wharton\xe2\x80\x99s Criminal Law \xc2\xa7101 (15th ed. 1994).  Though, before 1993, Arizona had in place the full <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>test with this sequential enquiry, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Schantz</em>, 98 Ariz., at 207, 403 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 525, it would appear that the legislature eliminated the cognitive capacity part not to change the meaning of the insanity standard but to implement its judgment that a streamlined standard with only the moral capacity part would be easier for the jury to apply, see Arizona House of Representative Judiciary Committee Notes 3 (Mar. 18, 1993); 1 R. Gerber, Criminal Law of Arizona 502\xe2\x80\x936, 502\xe2\x80\x9311 (2d ed. 1993 and Supp. 2000).  This is corroborated by the State\xe2\x80\x99s choice for many years against revising the applicable recommended jury instruction (enumerating the complete <em>M\xe2\x80\x99Naghten </em>test) in order to match the amended statutory standard.

As mentioned before, if substantial mental-disease and capacity evidence is accepted as rebutting <em>mens rea</em> in a given case, the affirmative defense of insanity will probably not be reached or ruled upon; the defendant will simply be acquitted (or perhaps convicted of a lesser included offense).  If an acquitted defendant suffers from a mental disease or defect that makes him dangerous, he will neither be confined nor treated psychiatrically unless a judge so orders after some independent commitment proceeding.  But if a defendant succeeds in showing himself insane, Arizona law (and presumably that of every other State with an insanity rule) will require commitment and treatment as a consequence of that finding without more.  It makes sense, then, to channel capacity evidence to the issue structured to deal with mental incapacity when such a claim is raised successfully.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Jones,</em> 463 U. S., at 368 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of commitment following an insanity acquittal \xe2\x80\xa6 is to treat the individual\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness and protect him and society from his potential dangerousness\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T46" name="F46">Footnote 46</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The rule also deals in a practical way with those whose insanity has been shown to make them dangerous to others.

ARIZONA<br/>\n548 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 05-5966<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ERIC MICHAEL CLARK, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> ARIZONA</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of\narizona, division one</p>\n<p align="left">[June 29, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Stevens and Justice Ginsburg join, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my submission the Court is incorrect in holding that Arizona may convict petitioner Eric Clark of first-degree murder for the intentional or knowing killing of a police officer when Clark was not permitted to introduce critical and reliable evidence showing he did not have that intent or knowledge.  The Court is wrong, too, when it concludes the issue cannot be reached because of an error by Clark\xe2\x80\x99s counsel.  Its reasons and conclusions lead me to file this respectful dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since I would reverse the judgment of the Arizona Court of Appeals on this ground, and the Arizona courts might well alter their interpretation of the State\xe2\x80\x99s criminal responsibility statute were my rationale to prevail, it is unnecessary for me to address the argument that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s definition of insanity violates due process.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark claims that the trial court erred in refusing to consider evidence of his chronic paranoid schizophrenia in deciding whether he possessed the knowledge or intent required for first-degree murder.  Seizing upon a theory invented here by the Court itself, the Court narrows Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim so he cannot raise the point everyone else thought was involved in the case.  The Court says the only issue before us is whether there is a right to introduce mental-disease evidence or capacity evidence, not a right to introduce observation evidence.  See <em>ante,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9325.  This restructured evidentiary universe, with no convincing authority to support it, is unworkable on its own terms.  Even were that not so, however, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s tripartite structure is something not addressed by the state trial court, the state appellate court, counsel on either side in those proceedings, or the briefs the parties filed with us.  The Court refuses to consider the key part of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim because his counsel did not predict the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own invention.  It is unrealistic, and most unfair, to hold that Clark\xe2\x80\x99s counsel erred in failing to anticipate so novel an approach.  If the Court is to insist on its approach, at a minimum the case should be remanded to determine whether Clark is bound by his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s purported waiver.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s error, of course, has significance beyond this case.  It adopts an evidentiary framework that, in my view, will be unworkable in many cases.  The Court classifies Clark\xe2\x80\x99s behavior and expressed beliefs as observation evidence but insists that its description by experts must be mental-disease evidence or capacity evidence.  See <em>ante,</em> at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.  These categories break down quickly when it is understood how the testimony would apply to the question of intent and knowledge at issue here.  The most common type of schizophrenia, and the one Clark suffered from, is paranoid schizophrenia.  See P. Berner et\xc2\xa0al., Diagnostic Criteria for Functional Psychoses 37 (2d ed. 1992).  The existence of this functional psychosis is beyond dispute, but that does not mean the lay witness understands it or that a disputed issue of fact concerning its effect in a particular instance is not something for the expert to address.  Common symptoms of the condition are delusions accompanied by hallucinations, often of the auditory type, which can cause disturbances of perception.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s expert testified that people with schizophrenia often play radios loudly to drown out the voices in their heads.  See App. 32.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s attorney argued to the trial court that this, rather than a desire to lure a policeman to the scene, explained Clark\xe2\x80\x99s behavior just before the killing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 294\xe2\x80\x93295.  The observation that schizophrenics play radios loudly is a fact regarding behavior, but it is only a relevant fact if Clark has schizophrenia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if this evidence were, to use the Court\xe2\x80\x99s term, mental-disease evidence, because it relies on an expert opinion, what would happen if the expert simply were to testify, without mentioning schizophrenia, that people with Clark\xe2\x80\x99s symptoms often play the radio loudly?  This seems to be factual evidence, as the term is defined by the Court, yet it differs from mental-disease evidence only in forcing the witness to pretend that no one has yet come up with a way to classify the set of symptoms being described.  More generally, the opinion that Clark had paranoid schizophrenia\xe2\x80\x94an opinion shared by experts for both the prosecution and defense\xe2\x80\x94bears on efforts to determine, as a factual matter, whether he knew he was killing a police officer.  The psychiatrist\xe2\x80\x99s explanation of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s condition was essential to understanding how he processes sensory data and therefore to deciding what information was in his mind at the time of the shooting.  Simply put, knowledge relies on cognition, and cognition can be affected by schizophrenia. See American Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 299 (4th ed. text rev. 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe characteristic symptoms of Schizophrenia involve a range of cognitive and emotional dysfunctions that include perception\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ibid.</em> (Symptoms include delusions, which are \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous beliefs that usually involve a misinterpretation of perceptions or experiences\xe2\x80\x9d).  The mental-disease evidence at trial was also intertwined with the observation evidence because it lent needed credibility.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s parents and friends testified Clark thought the people in his town were aliens trying to kill him.  These claims might not be believable without a psychiatrist confirming the story based on his experience with people who have exhibited similar behaviors.  It makes little sense to divorce the observation evidence from the explanation that makes it comprehensible.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming the Court\xe2\x80\x99s tripartite structure were feasible, the Court is incorrect when it narrows Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim to exclude any concern about observation evidence.  In deciding Clark\xe2\x80\x99s counsel failed to raise this issue, the Court relies on a series of perceived ambiguities regarding how the claim fits within the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own categories.  See <em>ante,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9325.  The Court cites no precedent for construing these ambiguities against the claimant and no prudential reason for ignoring the breadth of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  It is particularly surprising that the Court does so to the detriment of a criminal defendant asserting the fundamental challenge that the trier of fact refused to consider critical evidence showing he is innocent of the crime charged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The alleged ambiguities are, in any event, illusory.  The evidence at trial addressed more than the question of general incapacity or opinions regarding mental illness; it went further, as it included so-called observation evidence relevant to Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental state at the moment he shot the officer.  There was testimony, for example, that Clark thought the people in his town, particularly government officials, were not human beings but aliens who were trying to kill him.  See App. 119\xe2\x80\x93121, 131\xe2\x80\x93132, 192\xe2\x80\x93197, 249\xe2\x80\x93256; Tr. of Bench Trial in No. CR\xe2\x80\x932000\xe2\x80\x93538, pp. 110\xe2\x80\x93112, 131\xe2\x80\x93132, 136, 226\xe2\x80\x93228 (Aug. 20, 2003); <em>id.,</em> at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 59\xe2\x80\x9360 (Aug. 21, 2003).  The Court recognizes the existence of this essential observation evidence.  See <em>ante,</em> at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds, nonetheless, that \xe2\x80\x9cwe cannot be sure\xe2\x80\x9d whether the trial court failed to consider this evidence.  <em>Ante,</em> at 24.  It is true the trial court ruling was not perfectly clear.  Its language does strongly suggest, though, that it did not consider any of this testimony in deciding whether Clark had the knowledge or intent required for first-degree murder.  After recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cmuch of the evidence that [the defense is] going to be submitting, in fact all of it, as far as I know \xe2\x80\xa6 that has to do with the insanity could also arguably be made \xe2\x80\xa6 as to form and intent and his capacity for the intent,\xe2\x80\x9d the court concluded \xe2\x80\x9cwe will be focusing, as far as I\xe2\x80\x99m concerned, strictly on the insanity defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 9.  In announcing its verdict, the trial court did not mention any of the mental-illness evidence, observation or otherwise, in deciding Clark\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  <em>Id.,</em> at 331\xe2\x80\x93335.  The most reasonable assumption, then, would seem to be that the trial court did not consider it, and the Court does not hold otherwise.  See <em>ante,</em> at 20.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark\xe2\x80\x99s objection to this refusal by the trier of fact to consider the evidence as it bore on his key defense was made at all stages of the proceeding.  In his post-trial motion to vacate the judgment, Clark argued that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibiting consideration of <em>any</em> evidence reflecting upon a mentally ill criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to form the necessary <em>mens rea</em> violates due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record, Doc. 406, p.\xc2\xa08.  Clark pressed the same argument in the Arizona Court of Appeals.  See Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief in No. 1CA\xe2\x80\x93CR\xe2\x80\x9303\xe2\x80\x930851 etc., pp. 46\xe2\x80\x9352 (hereinafter Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief).  He also noted that the trial judge had erred in refusing to consider non-expert testimony\xe2\x80\x94presumably what the Court would call observation evidence\xe2\x80\x94on Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness.  <em>Id.,</em> at 47\xe2\x80\x9348<em>.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe trial court therefore violated [Clark\xe2\x80\x99s] right to present a defense because [the] court refused to consider <em>any</em> <em>evidence</em>, including the multiple testimonials of <em>lay</em> witnesses \xe2\x80\xa6 in deciding whether he could form the requisite <em>mens rea</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  The appeals court decided the issue on the merits, holding that the trial court was correct not to consider the evidence of mental illness in determining whether Clark had the <em>mens rea</em> for first-degree murder.  See App. 351\xe2\x80\x93353.  It offered no distinction at all between observation or mental-disease evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the appeals court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the Court states that the issue was not clearly presented to the state courts.  See <em>ante,</em> at 21\xe2\x80\x9324.  According to the Court, Clark only raised an objection based on <em>State </em>v. <em>Mott</em>, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d 1046 (1997) (en banc), see <em>ante,</em> at 21\xe2\x80\x9324, and <em>Mott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was limited to the exclusion of mental-disease and capacity evidence, see <em>ante,</em> at 19.  The Court is incorrect, and on both counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim goes well beyond an objection to <em>Mott</em>.  In fact, he specifically attempted to distinguish <em>Mott</em> by noting that the trial court in this case refused to consider all evidence of mental illness.  See Record, Doc. 406, at\xc2\xa08; see also Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief 48.  The Court notices these arguments but criticizes Clark\xe2\x80\x99s counsel for not being specific about the observation evidence he wanted the trial court to consider.  See <em>ante,</em> at 22.  There was no reason, though, for Clark\xe2\x80\x99s counsel to believe additional specificity was required, since there was no evident distinction in Arizona law between observation evidence and mental-disease testimony.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, <em>Mott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was not restricted to mental-disease evidence.  The Arizona Supreme Court did not refer to any distinction between observation and mental-disease evidence, or lay and expert testimony.  Its holding was stated in broad terms: \xe2\x80\x9cArizona does not allow evidence of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental disorder short of insanity either as an affirmative defense or to negate the <em>mens rea</em> element of a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  187 Ariz., at 541, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1051; see <em>id.,</em> at 540, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1050 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\xa6 evidences its rejection of the use of psychological testimony to challenge the <em>mens rea</em> element of a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court attempts to divine a fact/opinion distinction in <em>Mott</em> based on <em>Mott</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>distinguishing a case, <em>State</em> v. <em>Christensen</em>, 129 Ariz. 32, 628 P.\xc2\xa02d 580 (1981) (in banc), where evidence about behavioral tendencies was deemed admissible.  See <em>ante,</em> at 19.  <em>Christensen</em>, though, also addressed an expert opinion; the difference was that the evidence there concerned a \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter trait of acting reflexively in response to stress,\xe2\x80\x9d not a mental illness.  <em>Mott, supra, </em>at 544, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1054.  Since the Court recognizes the Arizona Court of Appeals relied on <em>Mott</em>, the expansive rule of exclusion in <em>Mott</em>\xe2\x80\x94without any suggestion of a limitation depending on the kind of evidence\xe2\x80\x94should suffice for us to reach the so-called observation-evidence issue.  Even if, as the Court contends, see <em>ante,</em> at 15, <em>Mott</em> is limited to expert testimony, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s categories still do not properly interpret <em>Mott</em>, because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own definition of observation evidence includes some expert testimony, see <em>ante,</em> at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It makes no difference that in the appeals court Clark referred to the issue as inability to form knowledge or intent.  See Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Brief 46\xe2\x80\x9352.  He did not insist on some vague, general incapacity.  He stated, instead, that he \xe2\x80\x9csuffered from a major mental illness and was psychotic at the time of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 48.  Even if Clark\xe2\x80\x99s arguments were insufficient to apprise the state court of the argument, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ur traditional rule is that \xe2\x80\x98[o]nce a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lebron</em> v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/374/index.html">513 U. S. 374</a>, 379 (1995) (quoting <em>Yee</em> v. <em>Escondido,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/index.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 534 (1992)).  The claim is clear.  Though it seems to be obscure to this Court, it was understood by the Arizona Court of Appeals, which stated: \xe2\x80\x9cClark argues that the trial court erred in refusing to consider evidence of his mental disease or defect in determining whether he had the requisite <em>mens rea</em> to commit first-degree murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 351.  When the question is what the state court held, it is not instructive for this Court to recast the words the state court used.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The razor-thin distinction the Court draws between evidence being used to show incapacity and evidence being used to show lack of <em>mens rea</em> directly does not identify two different claims.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s single claim, however characterized, involves the use of the same mental-illness evidence to decide whether he had the requisite knowledge or intent.  The various ways in which the evidence is relevant in disproving <em>mens rea</em> hardly qualify as separate claims.  The new arguments allowed in <em>Lebron</em> and <em>Yee</em>, by comparison, were far more disconnected from the initial bases for the alleged violations.  See <em>Lebron, supra</em>, at 378, 379 (for purposes of showing state action, petitioner could argue that Amtrak was a Government entity even though he argued below only that it was a private entity with close connections to Government entities, because the claim was simply \xe2\x80\x9cthat Amtrak did not accord him the rights it was obliged to provide by the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Yee, supra</em>, at 534, 535 (petitioners could argue that an ordinance constituted a regulatory taking, even though they arguably asserted in the Court of Appeals only a physical taking, because the claim was simply \xe2\x80\x9cthat the ordinance effects an unconstitutional taking\xe2\x80\x9d).  If we give this latitude to litigants in civil cases, surely we must do so here.  Furthermore, to the extent any ambiguity remains on whether the claim was raised, the proper course is to remand.  See <em>Bradshaw</em> v. <em>Richey,</em> 546 U. S. ___, ___ (2005) (slip op., at 6) <em>(per curiam).</em>  Unless the state court clearly decides an issue on state-law grounds, which the Court does not contend occurred here, there is no bar to our review of the federal question.  See <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Reed,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/255/index.html">489 U. S. 255</a>, 261\xe2\x80\x93262 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before this Court Clark framed the issue in broad terms that encompass the question whether the evidence of his mental illness should have been considered to show he did not at the time of the offense have the knowledge or intent to shoot a police officer.  See Brief for Petitioner i (\xe2\x80\x9cQuestions Presented for Review: (1) Whether Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s blanket exclusion of evidence and refusal to consider mental disease or defect to rebut the state\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on the element of <em>mens rea</em> violated Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to due process under the United States Constitution, Fourteenth Amendment?\xe2\x80\x9d), 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, the trial court held that under the <em>Mott</em> rule it was obliged to find as a fact that [Clark] knew he was shooting a police officer to death\xe2\x80\x94a necessary factual element of the only form of first degree murder charged against [Clark]\xe2\x80\x94while simultaneously refusing to consider [Clark\xe2\x80\x99s] evidence that<em> </em>an acute episode of his chronic paranoid schizophrenic illness prevented him from actually having that knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis omitted)), 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (the Arizona courts erred in holding Clark \xe2\x80\x9ccould be punished as though he had this knowledge and intent although he may not in fact have had either\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief for Petitioner 3 (challenging the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s refusal \xe2\x80\x9cto give any consideration to the mental-illness evidence in making his factual findings as to whether [Clark] did or did not act with the state of mind required for a first-degree murder conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).  An entire section of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s opening brief argues that the evidence of mental illness should have been considered to rebut the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s inference of knowledge or intent from the factual circumstances of the crime.  See Brief for Petitioner 13\xe2\x80\x9321.  This line of argument concerns facts of behavior and amounts to more than a claim of general incapacity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark seeks resolution of issues that can be complex and somewhat overlapping.  In the end, however, we must decide whether he had the right to introduce evidence showing he lacked the intent or knowledge the statute itself sets forth in describing a basic element of the crime.  Clark has preserved this issue at all stages, including in this Court.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Clark was charged with first-degree murder for the shooting of Officer Jeffrey Moritz.  \xe2\x80\x9cA person commits first-degree murder if,\xe2\x80\x9d as relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]ntending or knowing that the person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct will cause death to a law enforcement officer, the person causes the death of a law enforcement officer who is in the line of duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ariz.

S. 44</a>, 58, 56 (1987)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The central theory of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s defense was that his schizophrenia made him delusional.  He lived in a universe where the delusions were so dominant, the theory was, that he had no intent to shoot a police officer or knowledge he was doing so.  It is one thing to say he acted with intent or knowledge to pull the trigger.  It is quite another to say he pulled the trigger to kill someone he knew to be a human being and a police officer.  If the trier of fact were to find Clark\xe2\x80\x99s evidence sufficient to discount the case made by the State, which has the burden to prove knowledge or intent as an element of the offense, Clark would not be guilty of first-degree murder under Arizona law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court attempts to diminish Clark\xe2\x80\x99s interest by treating mental-illness evidence as concerning only \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than fact.  <em>Ante,</em> at 36.  This view appears to derive from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s claim as raising only general incapacity.  See <em>ibid.</em>  This is wrong for the reasons already discussed.  It fails to recognize, moreover, the meaning of the offense element in question here.  The <em>mens rea</em> element of intent or knowledge may, at some level, comprise certain moral choices, but it rests in the first instance on a factual determination.  That is the fact Clark sought to put in issue.  Either Clark knew he was killing a police officer or he did not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue is not, as the Court insists, whether Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness acts as an \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse from customary criminal responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 30, but whether his mental illness, as a factual matter, made him unaware that he was shooting a police officer.  If it did, Clark needs no excuse, as then he did not commit the crime as Arizona defines it.  For the elements of first-degree murder, where the question is knowledge of particular facts\xe2\x80\x94that one is killing a police officer\xe2\x80\x94the determination depends not on moral responsibility but on empirical fact.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of mental illness had a direct and substantial bearing upon what he knew, or thought he knew, to be the facts when he pulled the trigger; this lay at the heart of the matter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion was all the more severe because it barred from consideration on the issue of <em>mens rea</em> all this evidence, from any source, thus preventing Clark from showing he did not commit the crime as defined by Arizona law.  Quite apart from due process principles, we have held that a bar of this sort can be inconsistent with the Confrontation Clause.  See <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Van Arsdall,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/673/index.html">475 U. S. 673</a> (1986).  In <em>Van Arsdall</em> the Court held a state court erred in making a ruling that \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited <em>all</em> inquiry into\xe2\x80\x9d an event.  <em>Id.,</em> at 679.  At issue was a line of defense questioning designed to show the bias of a prosecution witness.  In the instant case the ruling in question bars from consideration all testimony from all witnesses necessary to present the argument that was central to the whole case for the defense: a challenge to the State\xe2\x80\x99s own proof on an element of the crime.  The Due Process and Compulsory Process Clauses, and not the Confrontation Clause, may be the controlling standard; but the disability imposed on the accused is every bit as substantial and pervasive here as it was in <em>Van Arsdall</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rule is problematic because it excludes evidence no matter how credible and material it may be in disproving an element of the offense.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have noted the potential arbitrariness of <em>per se</em> exclusions and, on this rationale, have invalidated various state prohibitions.  See <em>Holmes, supra</em>,<em> </em>at ___ (slip op., at 9) (rule excluding, in certain cases, evidence that a third party may have committed the crime \xe2\x80\x9ceven if that evidence, if viewed independently, would have great probative value and even if it would not pose an undue risk of harassment, prejudice, or confusion of the issues\xe2\x80\x9d);  <em>Rock, supra</em>, at 56 (rule excluding all hypnotically refreshed testimony \xe2\x80\x9coperates to the detriment of any defendant who undergoes hypnosis, without regard to the reasons for it, the circumstances under which it took place, or any independent verification of the information it produced\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/14/index.html">388 U. S. 14</a>, 22 (1967) (rule excluding accomplice testimony \xe2\x80\x9cprevent[s] whole categories of defense witnesses from testifying on the basis of <em>a priori</em> categories that presume them unworthy of belief\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not to suggest all general rules on the exclusion of certain types of evidence are invalid.  If the rule does not substantially burden the defense, then it is likely permissible.  See <em>Scheffer, </em>523<em> </em>U. S., at 316\xe2\x80\x93317 (upholding exclusion of polygraph evidence in part because this rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not implicate any significant interest of the accused\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ome later case might present a more compelling case for introduction of the testimony than this one does\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where, however, the burden is substantial, the State must present a valid reason for its <em>per se</em> evidentiary rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s proposed reasons are insufficient to support its categorical exclusion.  While the State contends that testimony regarding mental illness may be too incredible or speculative for the jury to consider, this does not explain why the exclusion applies in all cases to all evidence of mental illness.  \xe2\x80\x9cA State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in barring unreliable evidence does not extend to <em>per se</em> exclusions that may be reliable in an individual case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rock, </em>483<em> </em>U. S., at 61.  States have certain discretion to bar unreliable or speculative testimony and to adopt rules to ensure the reliability of expert testimony.  Arizona has done so, and there is no reason to believe its rules are insufficient to avoid speculative evidence of mental illness.  See Ariz. Rules of Evid. 403, 702 (West 2005).  This is particularly true because Arizona applies its usual case-by-case approach to permit admission of evidence of mental illness for a variety of other purposes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State</em> v. <em>Lindsey</em>, 149 Ariz. 472, 474\xe2\x80\x93475, 720 P.\xc2\xa02d 73, 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (1986) (en banc) (psychological characteristics of molestation victims); <em>State</em> v. <em>Hamilton</em>, 177 Ariz. 403, 408\xe2\x80\x93410, 868 P.\xc2\xa02d 986, 991\xe2\x80\x93993 (App. 1993) (psychological evidence of child abuse accommodation syndrome); <em>Horan</em> v. <em>Indus. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 167 Ariz. 322, 325\xe2\x80\x93326, 806 P.\xc2\xa02d 911, 914\xe2\x80\x93915 (App. 1991) (psychiatric testimony regarding neurological deficits).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The risk of jury confusion also fails to justify the rule.  The State defends its rule as a means to avoid the complexities of determining how and to what degree a mental illness affects a person\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.  The difficulty of resolving a factual issue, though, does not present a sufficient reason to take evidence away from the jury even when it is crucial for the defense.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have always trusted juries to sort through complex facts in various areas of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 289 (2005) (Stevens, J., dissenting in part).  Even were the risk of jury confusion real enough to justify excluding evidence in most cases, this would provide little basis for prohibiting all evidence of mental illness without any inquiry into its likely effect on the jury or its role in deciding the linchpin issue of knowledge and intent.  Indeed, Arizona has a rule in place to serve this very purpose.  See Ariz. Rule of Evid. 403.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming the reliability and jury-confusion justifications were persuasive in some cases, they would not suffice here.  It does not overcome the constitutional objection to say that an evidentiary rule that is reasonable on its face can be applied as well to bar significant defense evidence without any rational basis for doing so.  In <em>Van Arsdall,</em> for example, the Court rejected the application of Delaware Rule of Evidence 403, which allows relevant evidence to be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the risk of unfair prejudice or other harms to the trial process.  475 U. S., at 676, and n.\xc2\xa02.  While the Rule is well established and designed for a legitimate function, the Constitution prevented an application that deprived the defendant of all inquiry into an important issue.  <em>Id.,</em> at 679.  Other cases have applied this same case-specific analysis in deciding the legitimacy of an exclusion.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Rock, supra,</em> at 62 (the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances present an argument for admissibility of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s testimony in this particular case, an argument that must be considered by the trial court\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Chambers</em> v. <em>Mississippi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/410/284/index.html">410 U. S. 284</a>, 302 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn these circumstances, where constitutional rights directly affecting the ascertainment of guilt are implicated, the hearsay rule may not be applied mechanistically\nto defeat the ends of justice\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Scheffer,</em> 523 U. S., at\n318 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court undertakes little analysis of the interests particular to this case.  By proceeding in this way it devalues Clark\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.  The reliability rationale has minimal applicability here.  The Court is correct that many mental diseases are difficult to define and the subject of great debate.  See <em>ante,</em> at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  Schizophrenia, however, is a well-documented mental illness, and no one seriously disputes either its definition or its most prominent clinical manifestations.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s own expert conceded that Clark had paranoid schizophrenia and was actively psychotic at the time of the killing.  See App. 254\xe2\x80\x93257.  The jury-confusion rationale, if it is at all applicable here, is the result of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own insistence on conflating the insanity defense and the question of intent.  Considered on its own terms, the issue of intent and knowledge is a straightforward factual question.  A trier of fact is quite capable of weighing defense testimony and then determining whether the accused did or did not intend to kill or knowingly kill a human being who was a police officer.  True, the issue can be difficult to decide in particular instances, but no more so than many matters juries must confront.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court says mental-illness evidence \xe2\x80\x9ccan easily mislead,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 36, and may \xe2\x80\x9ctel[l] us little or nothing about the ability of the defendant to form <em>mens rea,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 35.  These generalities do not, however, show how relevant or misleading the evidence in this case would be (or explain why Arizona Rule of Evidence 403 is insufficient for weighing these factors).  As explained above, the evidence of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness bears directly on <em>mens rea</em>, for it suggests Clark may not have known he was killing a human being.  It is striking that while the Court discusses at length the likelihood of misjudgment from placing too much emphasis on evidence of mental illness, see <em>ante,</em> at 33\xe2\x80\x9338, it ignores the risk of misjudging an innocent man guilty from refusing to consider this highly relevant evidence at all.  Clark\xe2\x80\x99s expert, it is true, said no one could know exactly what was on Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mind at the time of the shooting.  See <em>ante,</em> at 37.  The expert testified extensively, however, about the effect of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s delusions on his perceptions of the world around him, and about whether Clark\xe2\x80\x99s behavior around the time of the shooting was consistent with delusional thinking.  This testimony was relevant to determining whether Clark knew he was killing a human being.  It also bolstered the testimony of lay witnesses, none of which was deemed unreliable or misleading by the state courts.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the same reasons, the Court errs in seeking support from the American Psychiatric Association\xe2\x80\x99s statement that a psychiatrist may be justifiably reluctant to reach legal conclusions regarding the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.  See <em>ante,</em> at 37.  In this very case, the American Psychiatric Association made clear that psychiatric evidence plays a crucial role regardless of whether the psychiatrist testifies on the ultimate issue: \xe2\x80\x9cExpert evidence of mental disorders, presented by qualified professionals and subject to adversarial testing, is both relevant to the mental-state issues raised by <em>mens rea</em> requirements and reliable\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Such evidence could not be condemned wholesale without unsettling the legal system\xe2\x80\x99s central reliance on such evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American Psychiatric Association et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante,</em> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336, the fact that the state and defense experts drew different conclusions about the effect of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness on his mental state only made Clark\xe2\x80\x99s evidence contested; it did not make the evidence irrelevant or misleading.  The trial court was capable of evaluating the competing conclusions, as factfinders do in countless cases where there is a dispute among witnesses.  In fact, the potential to mislead will be far greater under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new evidentiary system, where jurors will receive observation evidence without the necessary explanation from experts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that mental-illness evidence may be considered in deciding criminal responsibility does not compensate for its exclusion from consideration on the <em>mens rea</em> elements of the crime.  Cf. <em>ante,</em> at 33.  The evidence addresses different issues in the two instances.  Criminal responsibility involves an inquiry into whether the defendant knew right from wrong, not whether he had the <em>mens rea</em> elements of the offense.  While there may be overlap between the two issues, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence or nonexistence of legal insanity bears no necessary relationship to the existence or nonexistence of the required mental elements of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mullaney</em> v. <em>Wilbur,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/684/index.html">421 U. S. 684</a>, 706 (1975) (Rehnquist, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the analyses were equivalent, there is a different burden of proof for insanity than there is for <em>mens rea</em>.  Arizona requires the defendant to prove his insanity by clear and convincing evidence.  See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa713\xe2\x80\x93502(C) (West 2001).  The prosecution, however, must prove all elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  See<em> Mullaney, supra</em>, at 703\xe2\x80\x93704; <em>In re Winship,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/358/index.html">397 U. S. 358</a>, 364 (1970).  The shift in the burden on the criminal responsibility issue, while permissible under our precedent, see <em>Leland</em> v. <em>Oregon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/790/index.html">343 U. S. 790</a> (1952), cannot be applied to the question of intent or knowledge without relieving the State of its responsibility to establish this element of the offense.  See <em>Sandstrom</em> v. <em>Montana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/510/index.html">442 U. S. 510</a>, 524 (1979) (jury instruction that had the effect of placing the burden on the defendant to disprove that he had the requisite mental state violates due process).  While evidentiary rules do not generally shift the burden impermissibly, where there is a right to have evidence considered on an element of the offense, the right is not respected by allowing the evidence to come in only on an issue for which the defendant bears the burden of proof.  See <em>Cool</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/100/index.html">409 U. S. 100</a>, 103 (1972) <em>(per curiam)</em> (jury instruction that allowed jury to consider accomplice\xe2\x80\x99s testimony only if it was true beyond a reasonable doubt \xe2\x80\x9cplaces an improper burden on the defense and allows the jury to convict despite its failure to find guilt beyond a reasonable doubt\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Ohio,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/228/index.html">480 U. S. 228</a>, 233\xe2\x80\x93234 (1987) (State can shift the burden on a claim of self-defense, but if the jury were disallowed from considering self-defense evidence for purposes of deciding the elements of the offense, it \xe2\x80\x9cwould relieve the State of its burden and plainly run afoul of <em>Winship</em>\xe2\x80\x99s mandate\xe2\x80\x9d).  By viewing the Arizona rule as creating merely a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of sanity (or capacity or responsibility),\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 30, rather than a presumption that the <em>mens rea</em> elements were not affected by mental illness, the Court fails to appreciate the implications for <em>Winship</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State attempts to sidestep the evidentiary issue entirely by claiming that its mental-illness exclusion simply alters one element of the crime.  The evidentiary rule at issue here, however, cannot be considered a valid redefinition of the offense.  Under the State\xe2\x80\x99s logic, a person would be guilty of first-degree murder if he knowingly or intentionally killed a police officer or committed the killing under circumstances that would show knowledge or intent but for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness.  To begin with, Arizona law does not say this.  And if it did, it would be impermissible.  States have substantial discretion in defining criminal offenses.  In some instances they may provide that the accused has the burden of persuasion with respect to affirmative defenses.  See <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/197/index.html">432 U. S. 197</a>, 210 (1977).  \xe2\x80\x9cBut there are obviously constitutional limits beyond which the States may not go in this regard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  If it were otherwise, States could label all evidentiary exclusions as redefinitions and so evade constitutional requirements.  There is no rational basis, furthermore, for criminally punishing a person who commits a killing without knowledge or intent only if that person has a mental illness.  Cf. <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/index.html">370 U. S. 660</a>, 666 (1962).  The State attempts to bring the instant case within the ambit of <em>Montana</em> v. <em>Egelhoff,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/37/index.html">518 U. S. 37</a> (1996); but in <em>Egelhoff</em> the excluded evidence concerned voluntary intoxication, for which a person can be held responsible.  Viewed either as an evidentiary rule or a redefinition of the offense, it was upheld because it \xe2\x80\x9ccomports with and implements society\xe2\x80\x99s moral perception that one who has voluntarily impaired his own faculties should be responsible for the consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 50 (plurality opinion).  An involuntary mental illness does not implicate this justification.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Future dangerousness is not, as the Court appears to conclude, see<em> ante,</em> at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, n. 45, a rational basis for convicting mentally ill individuals of crimes they did not commit.  Civil commitment proceedings can ensure that individuals who present a danger to themselves or others receive proper treatment without unfairly treating them as criminals.  The State presents no evidence to the contrary, and the Court ought not to imply otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State gains little support from <em>Fisher</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/463/index.html">328 U. S. 463</a> (1946).  There the defendant requested an instruction from the trial court that the jury consider his mental deficiencies in determining his capacity for premeditation and deliberation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 470.  The Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n view of the status of the defense of partial responsibility in the District and the nation no contention is or could be made of the denial of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 466.  This dictum may be attributable to the fact that the cases recognizing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary rights and the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s duty to prove all elements beyond a reasonable doubt were still decades away.  It may also reflect the fact that the jury instructions as given did seem to allow the jury to consider evidence of mental deficiency if it disproved the elements of the offense.  See <em>id.,</em> at 467, n.\xc2\xa03 (The jury instructions stated, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98It is further contended that even if sane and responsible, there was no deliberate intent to kill, nor in fact any actual intent to kill.  Therefore if not guilty by reason of insanity, the defendant at most is guilty only of second degree murder or manslaughter\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even further ambiguity comes from the fact that the defense in <em>Fisher</em> concerned a claim that the petitioner was \xe2\x80\x9cmentally somewhat below the average\xe2\x80\x9d with a \xe2\x80\x9cpsychopathic personality\xe2\x80\x9d of aggression.  <em>Id.,</em> at 467.  This general claim of mental deficiencies was relevant to the \xe2\x80\x9ctheory of partial responsibility,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 470, he wanted the jury to consider.  Unlike the mental illness here, though, which concerns inadequacy of perception and information processing, the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim may not have been relevant to <em>mens rea</em> unless <em>mens rea</em> were redefined to include an element of responsibility.  <em>Fisher</em>\xe2\x80\x99s language, then, does not control this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rule is not unique, either historically or in contemporary practice, this fact does not dispose of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional argument.  To the extent <em>Fisher</em> may have suggested the contrary, subsequent cases make clear that while the existence of the rule in some jurisdictions is a significant factor to consider, see <em>Egelhoff, supra</em>, at 43 (plurality opinion), it is not dispositive for evaluation of a claim that the accused was foreclosed from introducing evidence crucial to the defense.  The evidentiary exclusion of accomplice testimony the Court invalidated in <em>Washington</em> was, in fact, well established.  See 388 U. S., at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.  The exclusion of hypnotically refreshed testimony likewise had some support when the Court held it unconstitutional as applied to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own testimony.  <em>Rock, </em>483<em> </em>U. S., at 57.  While 13 States still impose significant restrictions on the use of mental-illness evidence to negate <em>mens rea</em>, a substantial majority of the States currently allow it.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 22\xe2\x80\x9323, and n.\xc2\xa013.  The fact that a reasonable number of States restrict this evidence weighs into the analysis, but applying the rule as a <em>per se</em> bar, as Arizona does, is so plainly unreasonable that it cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Putting aside the lack of any legitimate state interest for application of the rule in this case, its irrationality is apparent when considering the evidence that is allowed.  See <em>Washington, supra,</em> at 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe absurdity of the rule is amply demonstrated by the exceptions that have been made to it\xe2\x80\x9d).  Arizona permits the defendant to introduce, for example, evidence of \xe2\x80\x9cbehavioral tendencies\xe2\x80\x9d to show he did not have the required mental state.  See <em>Mott, </em>187 Ariz., at 544, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1054; <em>Christensen,</em> 129 Ariz., at 35\xe2\x80\x9336, 628 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 583\xe2\x80\x93584.  While defining mental illness is a difficult matter, the State seems to exclude the evidence one would think most reliable by allowing unexplained and uncategorized tendencies to be introduced while excluding relatively well-understood psychiatric testimony regarding well-documented mental illnesses.  It is unclear, moreover, what would have happened in this case had the defendant wanted to testify that he thought Officer Moritz was an alien.  If disallowed, it would be tantamount to barring Clark from testifying on his behalf to explain his own actions.  If allowed, then Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s rule would simply prohibit the corroboration necessary to make sense of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s explanation.  In sum, the rule forces the jury to decide guilt in a fictional world with undefined and unexplained behaviors but without mental illness.  This rule has no rational justification and imposes a significant burden upon a straightforward defense: He did not commit the crime with which he was charged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These are the reasons for my respectful dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962164">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n548 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nCLARK V. ARIZONA<br/>\n548 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 05-5966<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ERIC MICHAEL CLARK, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> ARIZONA</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the court of appeals of\narizona, division one</p>\n<p align="left">[June 29, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I understand the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it distinguishes among three categories of evidence related to insanity: (1) fact-related evidence as to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s specific state of mind at the time of the crime, <em>e.g.</em>, evidence that shows he thought the policeman was not a human being; (2) expert opinion evidence that the defendant suffered from a mental disease that would have affected his capacity to form an intent to kill a policeman, <em>e.g.</em>, that he suffers from a disease of a kind where powerful voices command the sufferer to kill; and (3) expert opinion evidence that the defendant was legally insane, <em>e.g.</em>, evidence that he did not know right from wrong.  <em> Ante</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s basic categorization.  I also agree that the Constitution permits a State to provide for consideration of the second and third types of evidence solely in conjunction with the insanity defense.  A State might reasonably fear that, without such a rule, the types of evidence as to intent would become confused in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s mind, indeed that in some cases the insanity question would displace the intent question as the parties litigate both simultaneously.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, I believe the distinction among these\nkinds of evidence will be unclear in some cases.  And though I accept the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the record, I remain concerned as to whether the lower courts, in setting forth and applying <em>State</em> v. <em>Mott</em>, 187 Ariz. 536, 931 P.\xc2\xa02d 1046 (en banc), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1234/index.html">520 U. S. 1234</a> (1997), focused with sufficient directness and precision upon the distinction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, I would remand this case so that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s courts can determine whether Arizona law, as set forth in <em>Mott</em> and other cases, is consistent with the distinction the Court draws and whether the trial court so applied Arizona law here.  I would also reserve the question (as I believe the Court has done) as to the burden of persuasion in a case where the defendant produces sufficient evidence of the second kind as to raise a reasonable doubt that he suffered from a mental illness so severe as to prevent him from forming any relevant intent at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For this reason, I dissent only from Parts III\xe2\x80\x93B and III\xe2\x80\x93C of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and the ultimate disposition of this case, and I join the remainder.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
