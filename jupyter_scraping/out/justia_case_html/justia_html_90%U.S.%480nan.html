S. 483</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The most important question presented by the assignment of errors is whether shares of stock in a national bank can be valued for taxation by the state in which the bank is located at an amount exceeding their par value.  In is certain that they cannot be taxed at a greater rate than is assessed upon other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens of the state.  Such is the express provision of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p>It is contended that the term "moneyed capital," as here </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 90 U. S. 484</a></p><p> used, signifies money put out at interest, and that as such capital is not taxed upon more than its par or nominal value, the par value of these shares is their maximum taxable value.</p>\n<p>We cannot concede that money at interest is the only moneyed capital included in that term as here used by Congress.  The words are "other moneyed capital."  That certainly makes stock in these banks moneyed capital, and would seem to indicate that other investments in stocks and securities might be included in that descriptive term.</p>\n<p>But even if it were true that these shares can only be taxed as money at interest is, the result contended for would not necessarily follow.  The money invested in a bank is not money put out at interest.  The money of the bank is so put out and the share of the shareholder represents his proportion of that money.  What the amount of this share is must in some form be ascertained in order to determine its taxable value.  If the nominal or par value of the stock necessarily indicated this amount, there might be some propriety in making that the taxable value; but as all know, such is not the case.  The available moneyed capital belonging to a bank may be diminished by losses or increased by accumulated profits.  Therefore some plan must be devised to ascertain what amount of money at interest is actually represented by a share of stock.  The State of Pennsylvania has provided that this may be done by an official appraisement, taking care to prevent abuses by declaring that such appraisement shall not be higher than the current market value of the stock at the place where the bank is located, and by giving an appeal to the Auditor General, who is authorized to inquire into the value and correct any errors that may appear.  There certainly is no apparent injustice in this.  It is not the amount of money invested which is wanted for taxation, but the amount of moneyed capital which the investment represents for the time being.</p>\n<p>If the value set upon the share does not exceed this amount, it will not be assessed at a greater rate than other money at interest.  Other plans may be devised to accomplish </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 90 U. S. 485</a></p><p> the same end, but it is sufficient for the purposes of this case that this plan is not unreasonable.  If a shareholder is not satisfied with the original appraisement, all he has to do is to appeal to the Auditor General, make known to him the actual condition of the affairs of the bank, and have the error if any exists corrected.  Hepburn did not see fit to avail himself of this right which he had.  He preferred to rest upon his supposed right under the Act of Congress to limit the power of assessment to the par value.  This right, we think, he did not have.</p>\n<p>It is next insisted that no municipal or school taxes could be assessed upon the shares of the First National Bank of Carlisle, a national bank located within the borough of Carlisle, because by the laws of Pennsylvania, as is claimed, other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens at that place is exempt from such taxation.</p>\n<p>In support of this claim, it is shown that all mortgages, judgments, recognizances, and moneys owing upon articles of agreement for the sale of real estate are exempt from taxation in that borough except for state purposes.  This is a partial exemption only.  It was evidently intended to prevent a double burden by the taxation both of property and debts secured upon it.  Necessarily there may be other moneyed capital in the locality than such as is exempt.  If there is, moneyed capital as such is not exempt.  Some part of it only is.  It could not have been the intention of Congress to exempt bank shares from taxation because some moneyed capital was exempt.  Certainly there is no presumption in favor of such an intention.  To have effect, it must be manifest.  The affirmative of the proposition rests upon him who asserts it.  In this case, it has not been made to appear.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>15 Stat. at Large 34.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Pamphlet Laws. 1870, p. 42.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ib.</em> 1868, p. 61.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
