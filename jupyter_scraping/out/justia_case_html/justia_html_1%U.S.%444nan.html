Witness James Rankin, Alexander Major. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 1 U.S. 444, 448</a></p><p> Upon this, the Defendant demurred for the variance between the covenants stated and assigned in the declaration, and the covenants appearing upon Oyer of the bond, condition, and assignments: And upon a joinder in demurrer, the question was brought before the Court, Whether this action of Covenant could be maintained on Lynn\'s assignment? which was argued at the last term, by Tilghman and Sergeant, for the Defendant; and Lewis and Ingersoll for the Plaintiff. </p><p> For the Defendant, it was contended, in support of the demurrer, that the assignment by Parker, was not within the act of assembly, 1 State Laws, 77. for Lestarjette was the legal obligee, and Parker only the obligee in interest; and, as no suit could have been maintained in Parker\'s name, arguments drawn from the act cannot apply to support the present action, but the assignment must be considered as made at common law. </p><p> That although Turner might have sued Lynn, yet, as it was only an equitable assignment, which is the case in respect to all choses in action, where positive law does not interpose, Turner\'s assignee could not support such an action, 2 Vez. 181. 1 P. Will. 252. 2 Black Rep. 1140. Cro J 179. The assignment is only an authority to receive the money; or, at most, a covenant, that, is Lynn received it, he would pay it to his assignee. There is nothing like an express covenant on the part of Lynn; though, relying on the word assigned, it will, perhaps, be contended, that there is an implied covenant. But, that (as it is already observed) is only an authority to receive the money; and the assignor can be guilty of no breach, unless he interferes with the recovery of his assignee. 1 L. Raym. 683. 3 Keb. 304. 2 L. Raym. 1242: 12 Mod. 553. 1 Mod.113. The law, indeed, will make a covenant where a man contravenes his agreement, by deed under hand and seal. See Ii Mod. 171. Cro. E. 157. But no action of covenant has ever been brought in England by the assignee of a bond against the assignor, which furnishes a strong argument that no such action will lie; 1 L. Raym. 683 12 Mod. 553. And there has been no judgment of any Court in Pennsylvania upon this point. The law is clear with respect to chattels in possession, that then an express warranty is necessary. 2 Salk. 210. 1 Stra. 459. See Bull. N.P. 272. Promissory notes are assignable to this effect by positive statute; for, at common law, the indorsee could not sue the indorser in his own name. See 1 State Laws, 77. </p><p> That, at least, due diligence ought to have been used to obtain the money from the obligor, as in the case of bills of exchange, or promissory notes, where a demand should not only be proved, but alledged, or it would be fatal on a writ of error. See Doug. In the present case no action was ever brought, nor any other attempt alledged to have been made for the recovery of the money, from the person who was originally bound to pay it. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 1 U.S. 444, 449</a></p><p> For the Plaintiff, in answer to these objections, it was insisted, that the assignment was under the act of assembly; and the following books were cited, 1 Bac. Abr. 527. 30. 2 Com Dig. 560 a 4; 2 Black. Rep.1640. L. Raym. 442. 1 Salk. 133. That, by all the cases cited, it appeared, that the word assigned amounts to a covenant that the money should be paid; that it was immaterial whether the assignment was legally made to Lynn, or not; since, if he had assigned what he had not a right to assign, that would in itself be a breach to support an action of covenant; that a bill, originally negotiable, will be so in the hands of every indorsee, although, the indorsement should not be to order. 1 Black. 295. 1 Stra. 557. And that as this bond was assignable in its nature, by virtue of an act of assembly, the defendant, having undertaken to assign it, rendered himself liable in an action of covenant to every subsequent assignee. And that if a demand was at all necessary, it sufficiently appeared in the general allegation in the declaration. </p><p> The Chief Justice now delivered the unanimous opinion of the Court; That the assignment by Joseph Parker to Joseph Lynn was not an assignment according to the act of assembly (i State Laws 77.) but only a transfer of the equitable interest in the bond; and that Joseph Lynn could not by virtue thereof maintain an action against the obligor in his own name. The bond was payable to Lestarjette; and, although Parker migh have released it, it could only at common law, be sued or assigned by the former. See Jenk. Cent. 221. ca 75. </p><p> That Joseph Lynn, the defendant, only assigned his equitable interest in the bond to George Turner. It appears indeed manifestly by the previous assignment of Joseph Parker (which was equally known to Turner and to Lynn) that he had no other interest to assign. It is, therefore, the mere transfer of a chose in action; and, even if an action of covenant might have been brought by George Turner against Lynn on the word assigned; yet, no such action could be maintained against him by the present Plaintiffs, as Lynn\'s assignment is not made to George Turner and his assigns. </p><p> That the covenant implied by the word assigned, extends only to this, that the assignee should receive the money from the obligor to his own use; and, if the obligee should receive it, that then the assignor would be answerable over for it. </p><p></p><p> By the Court: For these reasons, let judgment be entered for the Defendant.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
