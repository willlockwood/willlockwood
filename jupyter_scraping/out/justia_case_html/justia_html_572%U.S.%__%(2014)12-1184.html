Because the Patent Act does not define \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional,\xe2\x80\x9d the term is construed \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with [its] ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sebelius v. Cloer, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  In 1952, when Congress used the word in \xc2\xa7285 (and today, for that matter), \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xceptional\xe2\x80\x9d meant \xe2\x80\x9cuncommon,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crare,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnot ordinary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 889 (2d ed. 1934).  An \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d case, then, is simply one that stands out from others with re-spect to the substantive strength of a party\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.  District courts may determine whether a case is \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.  Cf. Fogerty v.

The first category\xe2\x80\x94cases involving litigation or certain other misconduct\xe2\x80\x94appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct.  But that is not the appropriate benchmark.  A district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable, though not independently sanctionable, conduct is so \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d as to justify an award.  For litigation to fall within the second category, a district court must determine that the litigation is both objectively baseless and brought in subjective bad faith.  But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to be \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federal Circuit imported this second category from Professional Real Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49\n, but that case\xe2\x80\x99s standard finds no roots in \xc2\xa7285\xe2\x80\x99s text and makes little sense in the context of the exceptional-case determination.

Wilderness Society,\n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 240\n\xe2\x80\x93259, this Court has declined to construe fee-shifting provisions narrowly so as to avoid rendering them superfluous.

General Revenue Corp., 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 9).  In 1946, Congress amended the Patent Act to add a discretionary fee-shifting provision, then codified in \xc2\xa770, which stated that a court \xe2\x80\x9cmay in its discretion award reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the prevailing party upon the entry of judgment in any patent case.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa770 (1946 ed.).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Courts did not award fees under \xc2\xa770 as a matter of course.  They viewed the award of fees not \xe2\x80\x9cas a penalty for failure to win a patent infringement suit,\xe2\x80\x9d but as appropriate \xe2\x80\x9conly in extraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Park-In-Theatres, Inc. v. Perkins, 190 F.\xc2\xa02d 137, 142 (CA9 1951).  The provision enabled them to address \xe2\x80\x9cunfairness or bad faith in the conduct of the losing party, or some other equitable consideration of similar force,\xe2\x80\x9d which made a case so unusual as to warrant fee-shifting.  Ibid.; see also Pennsylvania Crusher Co. v. Bethlehem Steel Co., 193 F. 2d 445, 451 (CA3 1951) (listing as \xe2\x80\x9cadequate justification[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for fee awards \xe2\x80\x9cfraud practiced on the Patent Office or vexatious or unjustified litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Six years later, Congress amended the fee-shifting provision and recodified it as \xc2\xa7285.  Whereas \xc2\xa770 had specified that a district court could \xe2\x80\x9cin its discretion award reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to the prevailing party,\xe2\x80\x9d the revised language of \xc2\xa7285 (which remains in force today) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court in exceptional cases may award reasonable attorney fees to the prevailing party.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have observed, in interpreting the damages provision of the Patent Act, that the addition of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d to \xc2\xa7285 was \xe2\x80\x9cfor purposes of clarification only.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  General Motors Corp. v.

See, e.g., True Temper Corp. v. CF&amp;I Steel Corp., 601 F.\xc2\xa02d 495, 508\xe2\x80\x93509 (CA10 1979); Kearney &amp; Trecker Corp. v.

In the two decades that followed, the Federal Circuit, like the regional circuits before it, instructed district courts to consider the totality of the circumstances when making fee determinations under \xc2\xa7285.  See, e.g., Rohm &amp; Haas Co. v. Crystal Chemical Co., 736 F.\xc2\xa02d 688, 691 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cCases decided under \xc2\xa7285 have noted that \xe2\x80\x98the substitution of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin exceptional cases\xe2\x80\x9d has not done away with the discretionary feature\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. v. Danbury Pharmacal, Inc., 231 F.\xc2\xa03d 1339, 1347 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn assessing whether a case qualifies as exceptional, the district court must look at the totality of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2005, however, the Federal Circuit abandoned that holistic, equitable approach in favor of a more rigid and mechanical formulation.  In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., 393 F.\xc2\xa03d 1378 (2005), the court held that a case is \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7285 only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there has been some material inappropriate conduct related to the matter in litigation, such as willful infringement, fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during litigation, vexatious or unjustified litigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like infractions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1381.  \xe2\x80\x9cAbsent misconduct in conduct of the litigation or in securing the patent,\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Circuit continued, fees \xe2\x80\x9cmay be imposed against the patentee only if both (1)\xc2\xa0the litigation is brought in subjective bad faith, and (2)\xc2\xa0the litigation is objectively baseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Federal Circuit subsequently clarified that litigation is objectively baseless only if it is \xe2\x80\x9cso unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed,\xe2\x80\x9d iLOR, LLC v. Google, Inc., 631 F.\xc2\xa03d 1372, 1378 (2011), and that litigation is brought in subjective bad faith only if the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cactually know[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that it is objectively baseless, id., at 1377.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, Brooks Furniture held that because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is a presumption that the assertion of infringement of a duly granted patent is made in good faith[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the underlying improper conduct and the characterization of the case as exceptional must be established by clear and convincing evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  393 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1382.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties to this litigation are manufacturers of exercise equipment.  The respondent, ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., owns U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent No. 6,019,710 (\xe2\x80\x99710 patent), which discloses an elliptical exercise machine that allows for adjustments to fit the individual stride paths of users.  ICON is a major manufacturer of exercise equipment, but it has never commercially sold the machine disclosed in the \xe2\x80\x99710 patent.  The petitioner, Octane Fitness, LLC, also manufactures exercise equipment, including elliptical machines known as the Q45 and Q47.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        ICON sued Octane, alleging that the Q45 and Q47 infringed several claims of the \xe2\x80\x99710 patent.  The District Court granted Octane\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment, concluding that Octane\xe2\x80\x99s machines did not infringe ICON\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  2011 WL 2457914 (D Minn., June 17, 2011).  Octane then moved for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees under \xc2\xa7285.  Applying the Brooks Furniture standard, the District Court denied Octane\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  2011 WL 3900975 (D Minn., Sept. 6, 2011).  It determined that Octane could show neither that ICON\xe2\x80\x99s claim was objectively baseless nor that ICON had brought it in subjective bad faith.  As to objective baselessness, the District Court rejected Octane\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the judgment of noninfringement \xe2\x80\x9cshould have been a foregone conclusion to anyone who visually inspected\xe2\x80\x9d Octane\xe2\x80\x99s machines.  Id., *2.  The court explained that although it had rejected ICON\xe2\x80\x99s infringement arguments, they were neither \xe2\x80\x9cfrivolous\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., *2\xe2\x80\x93*3.  The court also found no subjective bad faith on ICON\xe2\x80\x99s part, dismissing as insufficient both \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that [ICON] is a bigger company which never commercialized the \xe2\x80\x99710 patent\xe2\x80\x9d and an e-mail exchange between two ICON sales executives, which Octane had offered as evidence that ICON had brought the infringement action \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of commercial strategy.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Id., *4.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        ICON appealed the judgment of noninfringement, and Octane cross-appealed the denial of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  The Federal Circuit affirmed both orders.  496 Fed. Appx. 57 (2012).

Under the standard crafted in Brooks Furniture, a case is \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d only if a district court either finds litigation-related misconduct of an independently sanctionable magnitude or determines that the litigation was both \xe2\x80\x9cbrought in subjective bad faith\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  393 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1381.  This formulation superimposes an inflexible framework onto statutory text that is inherently flexible.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For one thing, the first category of cases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee awards\xe2\x80\x94those involving litigation misconduct or certain other misconduct\xe2\x80\x94appears to extend largely to independently sanctionable conduct.  See ibid. (defining litigation-related misconduct to include \xe2\x80\x9cwillful infringement, fraud or inequitable conduct in procuring the patent, misconduct during litigation, vexa-tious or unjustified litigation, conduct that violates Fed. R. Civ. P. 11, or like infractions\xe2\x80\x9d).  But sanctionable conduct is not the appropriate benchmark.  Under the standard announced today, a district court may award fees in the rare case in which a party\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable conduct\xe2\x80\x94while not necessarily independently sanctionable\xe2\x80\x94is nonetheless so \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d as to justify an award of fees.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The second category of cases in which the Federal Circuit allows fee awards is also too restrictive.  In order for a case to fall within this second category, a district court must determine both that the litigation is objectively baseless and that the plaintiff brought it in subjective bad faith.  But a case presenting either subjective bad faith or exceptionally meritless claims may sufficiently set itself apart from mine-run cases to warrant a fee award.  Cf. Noxell, 771 F. 2d, at 526 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e think it fair to assume that Congress did not intend rigidly to limit recovery of fees by a [Lanham Act] defendant to the rare case in which a court finds that the plaintiff \xe2\x80\x98acted in bad faith, vexatiously, wantonly, or for oppressive reasons\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Columbia Pictures Industries, Inc.,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49 (1993)\n (PRE), which involved an exception to the Noerr-Pennington doctrine of antitrust law.  It does not.  Under the Noerr-Pennington doctrine\xe2\x80\x94established by Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc.,\n\n365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 127 (1961)\n, and Mine Workers v. Pennington,\n\n381 U.\xc2\xa0S. 657 (1965)\n\xe2\x80\x94defendants are immune from antitrust liability for engaging in conduct (including litigation) aimed at influencing decisionmaking by the government.  PRE, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56.  But under a \xe2\x80\x9csham exception\xe2\x80\x9d to this doctrine, \xe2\x80\x9cactivity \xe2\x80\x98ostensibly directed toward influencing governmental action\xe2\x80\x99 does not qualify for Noerr immunity if it \xe2\x80\x98is a mere sham to cover .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an attempt to interfere directly with the business relationships of a competitor.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 51.

In other words, the plaintiff must have brought baseless claims in an attempt to thwart competition (i.e., in bad faith).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Brooks Furniture, the Federal Circuit imported the PRE standard into \xc2\xa7285.  See 393 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1381.  But the PRE standard finds no roots in the text of \xc2\xa7285, and it makes little sense in the context of determining whether a case is so \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d as to justify an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees in patent litigation.  We crafted the Noerr-Pennington doctrine\xe2\x80\x94and carved out only a narrow exception for \xe2\x80\x9csham\xe2\x80\x9d litigation\xe2\x80\x94to avoid chilling the exercise of the\n \nFirst Amendment right to petition the government for the redress of grievances.  See PRE, 508 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56 (\xe2\x80\x9cThose who petition government for redress are generally immune from antitrust liability\xe2\x80\x9d).  But to the extent that patent suits are similarly protected as acts of petitioning, it is not clear why the shifting of fees in an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d case would diminish that right.  The threat of antitrust liability (and the attendant treble damages,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715) far more significantly chills the exercise of the right to petition than does the mere shifting of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  In the Noerr-Pennington context, defendants seek immunity from a judicial declaration that their filing of a lawsuit was actually unlawful; here, they seek immunity from a far less onerous declaration that they should bear the costs of that lawsuit in exceptional cases.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We reject Brooks Furniture for another reason: It is so demanding that it would appear to render \xc2\xa7285 largely superfluous.

We have twice declined to construe fee-shifting provisions narrowly on the basis that doing so would render them superfluous, given the background exception to the American rule, see Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 412,\n419 (1978)\n; Newman v.

We have not interpreted comparable fee-shifting statutes to require proof of entitlement to fees by clear and convincing evidence.  See, e.g., Fogerty, 510 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 519; Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,\n\n496 U. S. 384 (1990)\n; Pierce v. Underwood,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n558 (1988)\n.  And nothing in \xc2\xa7285 justifies such a high standard of proof.  Section 285 demands a simple discretionary inquiry; it imposes no specific evidentiary burden, much less such a high one.  Indeed, patent-infringement litigation has always been governed by a preponderance of the evidence standard, see, e.g., B\xc3\xa9n\xc3\xa9 v. Jeantet,\n\n129 U.\xc2\xa0S. 683,\n688 (1889)\n, and that is the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard generally applicable in civil actions,\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9callows both parties to \xe2\x80\x98share the risk of error in roughly equal fashion,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Herman &amp; MacLean v.
