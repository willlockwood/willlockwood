Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html">451 U.

In No. 81-2386, respondent local union brought a formal grievance under the collective bargaining agreement based on petitioner employee\'s alleged improper discharge.  After a hearing, a joint union-management committee informed petitioner of its conclusion that the grievance was without merit, and the committee\'s determination became final on September 20, 1977.  On March 16, 1978, petitioner filed suit in Federal District Court, alleging that the employer had discharged him in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the union had represented him in the grievance procedure in a discriminatory, arbitrary, and perfunctory manner.  The District Court ultimately granted summary judgment against petitioner, concluding that <em>Mitchell</em> compelled application of Maryland\'s 30-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards to both of petitioner\'s claims.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.

The District Court, applying New York\'s 90-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards, dismissed the complaint against both the employer and the union.  Ultimately, the Court of Appeals, acting in light of the intervening decision in <em>Mitchell,</em> rejected the contention that \xc2\xa7 10(b) should be applied; affirmed the dismissal as to the employer under the 90-day arbitration statute; but reversed as to the union, concluding that New York\'s 3-year statute for malpractice actions governed.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

Typically short state limitations periods for vacating arbitration awards fail to provide the aggrieved employee with a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate his rights, and analogy to an action to vacate an arbitration award is problematic, at best, as applied to the employee\'s claim against the union.  While a state limitations period for legal malpractice is the closest state law analogy for the claim against the union, application of such a limitations period would not solve the problem caused by the too-short time in which the employee could sue the employer, and would preclude the relatively rapid resolution of labor disputes favored by federal law.  In contrast, \xc2\xa7 10(b)\'s 6-month period for filing unfair labor practice charges is designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake here.  Both the union\'s breach of its duty and the employer\'s breach of the bargaining agreement are often also unfair labor practices.

We left two points open, however.  First, our holding was limited to the employee\'s claim against the employer; we did not address what state statute should govern the claim against the union. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Second, we expressly limited our consideration to a choice between two <em>state</em> statutes of limitations; we did not address the contention that we should instead borrow a <em>federal</em> statute of limitations, namely, \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 160(b). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  These cases present these two issues.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="155">Page 462 U.

On June 27, 1977, he quit or was discharged [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] after refusing to drive a tractor-trailer that he contended was unsafe.  He took his complaint to the union, which made unsuccessful informal attempts to get DelCostello reinstated and then brought a formal grievance under the collective bargaining agreement.  A hearing was held before a regional joint union-management committee.  The committee concluded that the grievance was without merit.  DelCostello was informed of that decision in a letter dated August 19, 1977, forwarding the minutes of the hearing and stating that the minutes would be presented for approval at the committee\'s meeting on September 20.  DelCostello responded in a letter, but the minutes were approved without change.  Under the collective bargaining agreement, the committee\'s decision is final and binding on all parties.</p>\n<p>On March 16, 1978, DelCostello filed this suit in the District of Maryland against the employer and the union.  He </p><p><a class="page-number" name="156">Page 462 U. S. 156</a></p><p> alleged that the employer had discharged him in violation of the collective bargaining agreement, and that the union had represented him in the grievance procedure "in a discriminatory, arbitrary and perfunctory manner," App. in No. 81-2386, p.19, resulting in an unfavorable decision by the joint committee.  Respondents asserted that the suit was barred by Maryland\'s 30-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court disagreed, holding that the applicable statute was the 3-year state statute for actions on contracts. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  510 F.Supp. 716 (1981).  On reconsideration following our decision in <em>Mitchell,</em> however, the court granted summary judgment for respondents, concluding that <em>Mitchell</em> compelled application of the 30-day statute to both the claim against the employer and the claim against the union.  524 F.Supp. 721 (1981). [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of the District Court\'s order.  679 F.2d 879 (CA4 1982) (mem.).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Donald C.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In 1975 and 1976, respondents filed several </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 462 U. S. 157</a></p><p> grievances asserting that the employer had violated the collective bargaining agreement by assigning certain welding duties to employees in other job categories and departments of the plant, with the result that respondents were laid off or assigned to noncraft work.  The union processed the grievances through the contractually established procedure and, failing to gain satisfaction, invoked arbitration.  On February 24, 1978, the arbitrator issued an award for the employer, ruling that the employer\'s job assignments were permitted by the collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>Respondents filed this suit in the Western District of New York on January 9, 1979, naming both the employer and the union as defendants.  The complaint alleged that the company\'s work assignments violated the collective bargaining agreement, and that the union\'s "preparation, investigation and handling" of respondents\' grievances were "so inept and careless as to be arbitrary and capricious," in violation of the union\'s duty of fair representation.  App. in No. 81-2408, p. 10.  The District Court dismissed the complaint against both defendants, holding that the entire suit was governed by New York\'s 90-day statute of limitations for actions to vacate arbitration awards. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The Court of Appeals reversed on the basis of its prior holding in <em>Mitchell v. United Parcel Service, Inc.,</em> 624 F.2d 394 (CA2 1980), that such actions are governed by New York\'s 6-year statute for actions on contracts.

On remand, the Court of Appeals rejected the argument that the 6-month period of \xc2\xa7 10(b) applies.  Accordingly, following our decision in <em>Mitchell,</em> it applied the 90-day arbitration statute and affirmed the dismissal as to the employer.

Alternatively, the Steelworkers, petitioners in No. 81-2408, argue that the state statute for vacation of arbitration awards should apply to a claim against a union, as well as to one against an employer.

In <em>Vaca</em> and <em>Hines,</em> however, we recognized that this rule works an unacceptable injustice when the union representing the employee in the grievance/arbitration procedure acts in such a discriminatory, dishonest, arbitrary, or perfunctory fashion as to breach its duty of fair representation.

The suit against the employer rests on \xc2\xa7 301, since the employee is alleging a breach of the collective bargaining agreement.  The suit against the union is one for breach of the union\'s duty of fair representation, which is implied under the scheme of the National Labor Relations Act. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>"Yet the two claims are inextricably interdependent.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="165">Page 462 U. S. 165</a></p><p> \'To prevail against either the company or the Union, . . .

S. 570</a></span>-571.  The employee may, if he chooses, sue one defendant and not the other; but the case he must prove is the same whether he sues one, the other, or both.  The suit is thus not a straightforward breach of contract suit under \xc2\xa7 301, as was <em>Hoosier,</em> but a hybrid \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation claim, amounting to "a direct challenge to <em>the private settlement of disputes under [the collective bargaining agreement].\'"  <em>Mitchell, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#66">451 U.

S. 702</a></span>.  Also unlike the claim in <em>Hoosier,</em> it has no close analogy in ordinary state law.  The analogies suggested in <em>Mitchell</em> both suffer from flaws not only of legal substance, but, more important, of practical application in view of the policies of federal labor law and the practicalities of hybrid \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation litigation.\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Mitchell,</em> we analogized the employee\'s claim against the employer to an action to vacate an arbitration award in a commercial setting.  We adhere to the view that, as between the two choices, it is more suitable to characterize the claim that way than as a suit for breach of contract.  Nevertheless, the parallel is imperfect in operation.  The main difference is that a party to commercial arbitration will ordinarily be represented by counsel or, at least, will have some experience in matters of commercial dealings and contract negotiation.  Moreover, an action to vacate a commercial arbitral award will rarely raise any issues not already presented and contested in the arbitration proceeding itself.  In the labor setting, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="166">Page 462 U. S. 166</a></p><p> by contrast, the employee will often be unsophisticated in collective bargaining matters, and he will almost always be represented solely by the union.  He is called upon, within the limitations period, to evaluate the adequacy of the union\'s representation, to retain counsel, to investigate substantial matters that were not at issue in the arbitration proceeding, and to frame his suit.  Yet state arbitration statutes typically provide very short times in which to sue for vacation of arbitration awards. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Concededly, the very brevity of New York\'s 90-day arbitration limitations period was a major factor why, in <em>Mitchell,</em> we preferred it to the 6-year statute for breach of contract, 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#63">451 U. S. 63</a></span>-64; but it does not follow that, because 6 years is too long, 90 days is long enough.  <em>See also Hoosier, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html#707">383 U. S. 707</a></span>, n. 9.  We conclude that state limitations periods for vacating arbitration awards fail to provide an aggrieved employee with a satisfactory opportunity to vindicate his rights under \xc2\xa7 301 and the fair representation doctrine. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Moreover, as JUSTICE STEVENS pointed out in his opinion in <em>Mitchell,</em> analogy to an action to vacate an arbitration </p><p><a class="page-number" name="167">Page 462 U. S. 167</a></p><p> award is problematic, at best, as applied to the employee\'s claim against the union:</p>\n<p>"The arbitration proceeding did not, and indeed, could not, resolve the employee\'s claim against the union.  Although the union was a party to the arbitration, it acted only as the employee\'s representative; the [arbitration panel] did not address or resolve any dispute between the employee and the union. . . .  Because no arbitrator has decided the primary issue presented by this claim, no arbitration award need be undone, even if the employee ultimately prevails."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#73">451 U. S. 73</a></span> (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS suggested an alternative solution for the claim against the union:  borrowing the state limitations period for legal malpractice.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#72">451 U. S. 72</a></span>-75; <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#174">462 U. S. 174</a></span> (STEVENS, J., dissenting); <em>post,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#175">462 U. S. 175</a></span> (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting).  The analogy here is to a lawyer who mishandles a commercial arbitration.  Although the short limitations period for vacating the arbitral award would protect the interest in finality of the opposing party to the arbitration, the misrepresented party would retain his right to sue his lawyer for malpractice under a longer limitations period.  This solution is admittedly the closest state law analogy for the claim against the union.  Nevertheless, we think that it too suffers from objections peculiar to the realities of labor relations and litigation.</p>\n<p>The most serious objection is that it does not solve the problem caused by the too-short time in which an employee could sue his employer under borrowed state law.  In a commercial setting, a party who sued his lawyer for bungling an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 462 U. S. 168</a></p><p> arbitration could ordinarily recover his entire damages, even if the statute of limitations foreclosed any recovery against the opposing party to the arbitration.  The same is not true in the \xc2\xa7 301/fair representation setting, however.  We held in <em>Vaca,</em> and reaffirmed this Term in <em>Bowen,</em> that the union may be held liable only for "increases if any in [the employee\'s] damages caused by the union\'s refusal to process the grievance."  386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#197">386 U. S. 197</a></span>-198; 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/212/case.html#223">459 U.

Thus, if we apply state limitations periods, a large part of the damages will remain uncollectible in almost every case unless the employee sues within the time allotted for his suit against the employer. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Further, while application of a short arbitration period as against employers would endanger employees\' ability to recover most of what is due them, application of a longer malpractice statute as against unions would preclude the relatively rapid final resolution of labor disputes favored by federal law -- a problem not present when a party to a commercial arbitration sues his lawyer.  In No. 81-2408, for example, the holding of the Court of Appeals would permit a suit as long as three years after termination of the grievance proceeding; many States provide for periods even longer. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  What we said in <em>Mitchell</em> about the 6-year contracts statute urged there can as easily be said here:</p>\n<p>"It is important to bear in mind the observations made in the <em>Steelworkers Trilogy</em> that"</p>\n<p>"the grievance machinery under a collective bargaining agreement is at the very heart of the system of industrial self-government. . . .  The processing . . . machinery is actually a vehicle by which meaning and content are given to the collective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 462 U.

Although the present case involves a fairly mundane and discrete wrongful discharge complaint, the grievance and arbitration procedure often processes disputes involving interpretation of critical terms in the collective bargaining agreement affecting the entire relationship between company and union. . . .  This system, with its heavy emphasis on grievance, arbitration, and the \'law of the shop,\' could easily become unworkable if a decision which has given \'meaning and content\' to the terms of an agreement, and even affected subsequent modifications of the agreement, could suddenly be called into question as much as [three] years later."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#63">451 U.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>These objections to the resort to state law might have to be tolerated if state law were the only source reasonably available for borrowing, as it often is.  In this case, however, we have available a federal statute of limitations actually designed to accommodate a balance of interests very similar to that at stake here -- a statute that is, in fact, an analogy to the present lawsuit more apt than any of the suggested state law parallels. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  We refer to \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the National Labor Relations Act, which establishes a 6-month period for making charges of unfair labor practices to the NLRB. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 462 U. S. 170</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The NLRB has consistently held that all breaches of a union\'s duty of fair representation are in fact unfair labor practices.  <em>E.g., Miranda Fuel Co.,</em> 140 N.L.R.B. 181 (1962), <em>enf. denied,</em> 326 F.2d 172 (CA2 1963).  We have twice declined to decide the correctness of the Board\'s position, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and we need not address that question today.  Even if not all breaches of the duty are unfair labor practices, however, the family resemblance is undeniable, and indeed there is a substantial overlap.  Many fair representation claims (the one in No. 81-2386, for example) include allegations of discrimination based on membership status or dissident views, which would be unfair labor practices under \xc2\xa7 8(b)(1) or (2).  Aside from these clear cases, duty of fair representation claims are allegations of unfair, arbitrary, or discriminatory treatment of workers by unions -- as are virtually all unfair labor practice charges made by workers against unions.  <em>See generally</em> R. Gorman, Labor Law 698-701 (1976).  Similarly, it may be the case that alleged violations by an employer of a collective bargaining agreement will also amount to unfair labor practices.  <em>See id.</em> at 729-734.</p>\n<p>At least as important as the similarity of the rights asserted in the two contexts, however, is the close similarity of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="171">Page 462 U. S. 171</a></p><p> the considerations relevant to the choice of a limitations period.  As Justice Stewart observed in <em>Mitchell</em>:</p>\n<p>"In \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the NLRA, Congress established a limitations period attuned to what it viewed as the proper balance between the national interests in stable bargaining relationships and finality of private settlements, and an employee\'s interest in setting aside what he views as an unjust settlement under the collective bargaining system.  That is precisely the balance at issue in this case.  The employee\'s interest in setting aside the \'final and binding\' determination of a grievance through the method established by the collective bargaining agreement unquestionably implicates"</p>\n<p>"those consensual processes that federal labor law is chiefly designed to promote -- the formation of the . . . agreement and the private settlement of disputes under it."</p>\n<p>"<em>Hoosier,</em> 383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/383/696/case.html#702">383 U.

Accordingly, \'[t]he need for uniformity\' among procedures followed for similar claims, <em>ibid.,</em> as well as the clear congressional indication of the proper balance between the interests at stake, counsels the adoption of \xc2\xa7 10(b) of the NLRA as the appropriate limitations period for lawsuits such as this."</p>\n<p>451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#70">451 U.

We do not mean to suggest that federal courts should eschew use of state limitations periods anytime state law fails to provide a perfect analogy.  <em>See, e.g., Mitchell,</em> 451 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#61">451 U.

Nevertheless, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="172">Page 462 U. S. 172</a></p><p> when a rule from elsewhere in federal law clearly provides a closer analogy than available state statutes, and when the federal policies at stake and the practicalities of litigation make that rule a significantly more appropriate vehicle for interstitial lawmaking, we have not hesitated to turn away from state law.  <em>See</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#158">462 U.

More often, however, Congress has not given any express consideration to the problem of limitations periods.  In such cases, the general preference for borrowing state limitations periods could more aptly be called a sort of fallback rule of thumb than a matter of ascertaining legislative intent; it rests on the assumption that, absent some sound reason to do otherwise, Congress would likely intend that the courts follow their previous practice of borrowing state provisions.  <em>See also Auto Workers v.

The argument begs the question, since the Act authorizes application of state law only when federal law does not "otherwise require or provide."

S. 701</a></span>, the choice of a limitations period for a federal cause of action is itself a question of federal law.  If the answer to that question (based on the policies and requirements of the underlying cause of action) is that a timeliness rule drawn from elsewhere in federal law should be applied, then the Rules of Decision Act is inapplicable by its own terms.

The parallel to vacation of an arbitral award seems tenuous, at best, in these situations; it is doubtful that many state arbitration statutes would themselves cover such a case in a commercial setting.  Yet if it were thought necessary to apply different state rules to these different possibilities, the result would be radical variation in the treatment of cases that are not significantly different with regard to the principles of <em>Vaca, Hines,</em> and <em>Mitchell.</em>  Moreover, the difficulty of detecting and mustering evidence to show the union\'s breach of duty may be even greater in these situations, and it may not be an easy task to ascertain when the cause of action accrues -- obviously a matter of great importance when the statute of limitations may be as short as 30 days.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Inability to sue the employer would also foreclose use of such equitable remedies as an order to arbitrate.  <em>See Vaca,</em> 386 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/171/case.html#196">386 U.

I would apply those laws to resolve the worker-union disputes in these two cases.  And I would continue to abide by our holding in <em>Mitchell</em> in resolving the employee-employer dispute presented in No. 81-2386.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1789, the First Congress enacted the Rules of Decision Act (Act), Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 721, 1 Stat. 92, plainly stating:</p>\n<p>"That the laws of the several states, except where the constitution, treaties or statutes of the United States shall otherwise require or provide, shall be regarded as rules of decision in trials at common law in the courts of the United States in cases where they apply."</p>\n<p>In 1895, construing that Act, we held that state statutes of limitations provided the relevant rules of decision in patent infringement actions, explaining:</p>\n<p>"That this section [Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 721] embraces the statutes of limitations of the several States has been decided by this court in a large number of cases, which are collated in its opinion in <em>Bauserman v.

But nothing in the language, structure, or legislative history of the National Labor Relations Act compels the further conclusion that Congress intended the federal judiciary to abandon the traditional practice of borrowing state statutes of limitations when no federal statute directly applies.  Saying that a statute impliedly creates a cause of action is not the same thing as saying that it impliedly commands the courts to abandon the standard procedure for choosing limitations periods, and instead to borrow a period that Congress established for a different purpose.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As the Court recognizes, "resort to state law [is] the norm for borrowing of limitations periods."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#171">462 U. S. 171</a></span>.  When federal law is silent on the question of limitations, we borrow state law in the belief that, given our longstanding practice and congressional awareness of it, we can safely assume, in the absence of strong indications to the contrary, that Congress intends by its silence that we follow the usual rule. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="175">Page 462 U. S. 175</a></p><p> In <em>Auto Workers v. Hoosier Cardinal Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/696/case.html">383 U. S. 696</a></span> (1966), we applied the "norm" to a suit under \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185.  I see no reason in these cases to depart from our usual practice of borrowing state law, for we have no contrary indications strong enough to outweigh our ordinary presumption that Congress\' silence indicates a desire that we follow the ordinary rule.  As a result, I would look to state law for a limitations period.  For the reasons given by JUSTICE STEVENS in his separate opinion in <em>United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html">451 U. S. 56</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/56/case.html#72">451 U. S. 72</a></span>-74 (1981), I think that a malpractice action against an attorney provides the closest analogy to an employee\'s suit against his union for breach of the duty of fair representation, and I would apply the State\'s statute of limitations for such an action here.  In DelCostello\'s action against his employer, I, like JUSTICE STEVENS, would follow <em>Mitchell.</em> [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>I believe, basically for the reasons given by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#159">462 U. S. 159</a></span>-161, n. 13, that our practice of borrowing state periods of limitations depends largely on this general guide for divining congressional intent.  <em>See, e.g., Auto Workers v.

I agree with the Court that the Rules of Decision Act, 28 U.S.C.\xc2\xa7 1652, only puts the question, for it simply requires application of state law unless federal law applies.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/151/case.html#159">462 U.
