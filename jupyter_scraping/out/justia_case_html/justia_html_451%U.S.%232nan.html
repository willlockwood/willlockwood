On the moonlit evening of March 15, 1976, he and fellow Agent Gerald Wayne Hjelle were assigned to patrol the Sweetwater Pass, located on federal land in Pima County, Ariz., approximately 10 miles from the Mexican border. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  INS officials knew that the Pass was frequently traveled by aliens illegally entering the United States.  While patroling the Pass, respondent and his colleague were expected to stop and question any person suspected of being an alien and to arrest that person if he could not produce a lawful entry permit. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Both agents wore plain clothes, as was customary for patrol work in that rugged desert area.  Tr. 248-249, 293.</p>\n<p>Three Mexican males were traveling north along the trail when respondent\'s electronic sensor system signaled their approach. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Following standard procedure, Agent Hjelle stationed himself near where the path emerged from the canyon onto higher ground.  Respondent took a position some 100 yards to the south, on a bluff overlooking, but out of sight of, the path.  The plan called for Ejelle to stop any suspected illegal alien, identify himself, and conduct a brief inquiry to determine the suspect\'s status, while respondent approached from behind. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 451 U. S. 235</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The three men emerged from the canyon and saw Hjelle, who ordered them to stop.  <em>Id.</em> at 117, 283-284.  Before Hjelle could begin his questioning, one of the men turned and ran back south toward the border.  Respondent shouted after him to halt.  <em>Id.</em> at 174.  When the fleeing man failed to stop, respondent fired three shotgun blasts in his direction.  One hit the fugitive in the buttocks, causing multiple wounds.  <em>Id.</em> at 105-106.  Another struck him in the upper spine, severing the cord and leaving him a quadriplegic.  <em>Id.</em> at 87-88, 93.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent was indicted in the Superior Court of Pima County, Ariz., for assault with a deadly weapon, in violation of Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 13-249A and B (Supp. 1973). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Because the charge arose from an act committed while on duty for the INS, respondent, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1), [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] removed the case to the United States District Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 451 U. S. 236</a></p><p> for the District of Arizona.  The case was tried before a jury, and a verdict of guilty was returned.  Respondent then timely moved for arrest of judgment or, alternatively, for a new trial.  <em>See</em> Fed.Rules Crim.Proc. 33 and 34 [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The District Court granted respondent\'s motion to arrest judgment and dismissed the indictment; it did so on the ground that the State could not assert its criminal jurisdiction over federal lands.  7 Record 7-8.  The State immediately moved for reconsideration; the District Court also granted the State\'s motion and took the matter under advisement.  App. 36-38.  Nine months later, the District Court vacated its previous order arresting judgment.  445 F.Supp. 1123 (1977).  The court, on reconsideration, held that Arizona retained criminal jurisdiction over all land within its exterior boundaries. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Having determined that it properly could exercise jurisdiction over Arizona\'s claim, the District Court then proceeded <em>sua sponte</em> to construe respondent\'s motion under Rule 34 as a motion for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 29(c).  Although an immunity defense had not been raised at trial, and the State had not introduced any evidence designed to overcome that defense, the court concluded that it had erred in failing to instruct the jury on such a defense.  Relying on principles enunciated in <em>In re Neale,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/135/1/case.html">135 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/135/1/case.html#75">135 U. S. 75</a></span> (1890), and <em>Clifton v. Cox,</em> 549 F.2d 722 (CA9 1977), the District Court reasoned that respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 451 U. S. 237</a></p><p> would be immune from prosecution on a state criminal charge if he acted under color of federal law and in the honest belief that his actions were necessary and proper for the execution of his federal duties.  445 F.Supp. at [1126] 1127.  The court applied this standard to the evidence adduced at trial, and concluded that a reasonable jury could not have found respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  <em>Id.</em> at 1128.  The presumed motion for acquittal was granted, and the jury verdict was set aside.</p>\n<p>Claiming that the trial court had exceeded its authority, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the State filed a timely notice of appeal from the acquittal.  It invoked the appellate court\'s jurisdiction under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, by a brief per curiam opinion citing <em>Sanabria v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/54/case.html">437 U. S. 54</a></span> (1978), initially dismissed the appeal on double jeopardy grounds. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Upon timely petition for rehearing, however, the Court of Appeals withdrew the opinion, App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a, and substituted another in its place.  This time, by a divided vote, the court dismissed Arizona\'s appeal on the ground that jurisdiction was lacking.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 451 U.

Emphasizing the language of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731, the court held that the statute authorizes an appeal only when the <em>United States</em> is the prosecutor, not when a state prosecution has been removed to federal court.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals declined to consider whether state law provided Arizona with a right to appeal in this case.  Instead, the court reasoned that a criminal proceeding removed to federal court under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1) arises under federal law, and accordingly is to be controlled by that law, rather than state law.  The court concluded that "only Congress can authorize an appeal by a state in a \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1) criminal prosecution," and Congress had not done so.  608 F.2d at 1200.  The Court of Appeals also rejected the suggestion that the general appeals statute, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] provided authorization for Arizona\'s appeal.  608 F.2d at 1199, n. 3.</p>\n<p>The dissenting judge discerned separate bases for appellate jurisdiction in 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291. 608 F.2d at 1200-1202.

S. 239</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari in order to resolve a problem of appellate jurisdiction created by the federal removal statute.  445 U.S. 960 (190).  Because it is an issue that carries significance for federal-state relations, we pay close attention to both state and federal law bearing on its resolution.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>We begin by noting that, had respondent\'s trial occurred in state, rather than federal, court, Arizona\'s statutes, as construed and applied by the courts of that State, would enable the State to obtain the appellate review it seeks.  Under Arizona law, the prosecution is authorized to seek review, by certiorari, when its claim is that the lower court has exceeded its jurisdiction or has abused its discretion.  <em>See</em> Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. 12-2001 (1956). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The State\'s petition for review </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 451 U. S. 240</a></p><p> has ben routinely granted in numerous instances exactly like this case, where the prosecution seeks review of a judgment of acquittal following a guilty verdict.  <em>See, e.g., State ex rel. Hyder v. Superior Court (Clifton, Real Party in Interest),</em> 128 Ariz. 216, 624 P.2d 1264 (1981); <em>State ex rel. Hyder v. Superior Court (Moya, Real Party in Interest),</em> 124 Ariz. 560, 606 P.2d 411 (1980); <em>State ex rel. Dawson v. Superior Court,</em> 112 Ariz. 123, 538 P.2d 397 (1975).  <em>See also State v. Allen,</em> 27 Ariz.App. 577, 557 P.2d 176 (1976); <em>State v. Lopez,</em> 26 Ariz.App. 559, 550 P.2d 113 (1976); <em>State v. Gradillas,</em> 25 Ariz.App. 510, 512, 544 P.2d 1111, 1113 (1976). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, the sole question posed here is whether respondent\'s removal of the state prosecution to federal court for trial alters the nature of the State\'s otherwise well established right, under state law, to seek review of the instant judgment of acquittal.  We consider this question first by reviewing the legal effect of, and the policies served by, removal for trial under \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1).  We then examine respondent\'s argument that the federal law governing federal appellate jurisdiction not only does not permit, but also, in fact, bars the State\'s criminal appeal in federal court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 451 U. S. 241</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that the fact of removal substantially alters the State\'s right to seek review.  Reasoning that a case brought pursuant to \xc2\xa71442(a)(1) arises under federal law, the court held that state enabling statutes retain no significance.  But a state criminal proceeding against a federal officer that is removed to federal court does not "arise under federal law" in this preempting sense.  Rather, the federal court conducts the trial under federal rules of procedure while applying the criminal law of the State.  <em>Tennessee v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html">100 U. S. 257</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html#271">100 U. S. 271</a></span>-272 (1880).  <em>See</em> Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 54 (b)(1), Advisory Committee Notes, 18 U.S.C.App. pp. 1480-1481. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>This principle is entirely consistent with the purpose underlying the removal of proceedings commenced in state court against a federal officer.  Historically, removal under \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1) and its predecessor statutes was meant to ensure a federal forum in any case where a federal official is entitled to raise a defense arising out of his official duties. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 451 U. S. 242</a></p><p> of removal permits a trial upon the merits of the state law question free from local interests or prejudice.  <em>See Colorado v. Symes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/510/case.html">286 U. S. 510</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/286/510/case.html#517">286 U.

It also enables the defendant to have the validity of his immunity defense adjudicated in a federal forum.  <em>Willingham v. Morgan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/402/case.html">395 U.

For these reasons, this Court has held that the right of removal is absolute for conduct performed under color of federal office, and has insisted that the policy favoring removal "should not be frustrated by a narrow, grudging interpretation of \xc2\xa7 1442(a)(1)."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>At the same time, the invocation of removal jurisdiction by a federal officer does not revise or alter the underlying law to be applied.  In this respect, it is a purely derivative form of jurisdiction, neither enlarging nor contracting the rights of the parties. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Federal involvement is necessary in order to insure a federal forum, but it is limited to assuring that an impartial setting is provided in which the federal defense of immunity can be considered during prosecution under state law.  Thus, while giving full effect to the purpose of removal, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 451 U. S. 243</a></p><p> this Court retains the highest regard for a State\'s right to make and enforce its own criminal laws.  <em>Colorado v.

The plainest evidence of this vindication is the District Court\'s application of the immunity defense.  No further purpose of the removal statute would be served by denying the State a right to seek review when that very right is available under applicable state law.  On the contrary, it would be anomalous to conclude that the State\'s appellate rights were diminished solely because of the removal.  The statutory goal of ensuring fair and impartial adjudication is not advanced when the State, in effect, can be penalized by the defendant\'s decision to remove a criminal prosecution.  Absent any indication that the removal statute was intended to derogate from the State\'s interest in evenhanded enforcement of its laws, we see no justification for providing an unintended benefit to a defendant who happens to be a federal officer.

S. 244</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the purposes of the removal statute do not support denial of a State\'s customary right to seek appellate review, we do not suggest that this alone establishes the State\'s right to appeal in federal court.  Authorization to seek review under Arizona law is not a grant of federal <em>appellate</em> jurisdiction.  Nor, when added to the conclusion that removal itself fails to diminish Arizona\'s appellate rights, does this authorization amount to a grant of equivalent federal jurisdiction at the appellate level.  Because the criminal removal statute does not confer federal appellate jurisdiction, some independent federal basis is required if a State is to perfect its appeal.  Petitioner contends, in part, that such authorization derives from 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291, the general statutory grant of appellate jurisdiction.  Brief for Petitioner 49-58.  Respondent argues, however, that \xc2\xa7 1291 cannot support Arizona\'s appeal, because it has been found inadequate, standing alone, to support a criminal appeal by the Federal Government.  Brief for Respondent 32-40.  This argument deserves close attention, for it draws on the important tradition disfavoring criminal appeals by the sovereign.</p>\n<p>Under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291, any litigant armed with a final judgment from a lower federal court is entitled to take an appeal.  By its terms, the statute addresses neither the identity of particular parties nor the nature of the prior legal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 451 U. S. 245</a></p><p> proceedings. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  But while it is settled that a civil appeal, or an appeal by the defendant in a criminal case, may be taken from any final decision of a District Court, this Court has observed on prior occasions that, "<em>in the federal jurisprudence, at least, appeals by the Government in criminal cases are something unusual, exceptional, not favored.\'"  <em>Will v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html">389 U.

This federal policy has deep roots in the common law, for it was generally understood, at least in this country, that the sovereign had no right to appeal an adverse criminal judgment unless expressly authorized by statute to do so. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Accordingly, from the early days of the Republic, most state courts refused to consider appeals by prosecutors who lacked the requisite statutory authority.

The need to restrict appeals by the prosecutor reflected a prudential concern that individuals should be free from the harassment and vexation of unbounded litigation by the sovereign.  <em>See, e.g.,State v. Jones,</em> 7 Ga. 422, 425-426 (1849); <em>People v. Corning,</em> 2 N.Y. 9, 16 (1848).  This concern also underlies the constitutional ban against double jeopardy, which bars an appeal by the prosecutor following a jury verdict of acquittal.  <em>See, e.g., People v.

There, the Court held that no appellate right by the Federal Government exists in the absence of express enabling legislation from Congress.  The Court also concluded that the general grant of appellate jurisdiction contained in the Judiciary Act of 1891 did not satisfy this requirement. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In subsequent decisions, the Court has reaffirmed that the Federal Government enjoys no inherent right to appeal a criminal judgment, and that the grant of general appellate jurisdiction, now contained in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291, does not authorize such a federal appeal.  <em>DiBella v.

We do not believe that <em>Sanges</em> is to be so broadly construed.  <em>Sanges</em> holds simply that the federal sovereign may not subject one of its citizens to continued federal prosecution in its own courts where it has not been expressly permitted to do so under federal law.  144 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/323/case.html">144 U. S. 323</a></span>. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Our continuing refusal to assume that the United States possesses any inherent right to appeal reflects an abiding concern to check the Federal Government\'s possible misuse of its enormous prosecutorial powers.  By insisting that Congress speak with a clear voice when extending to the Executive a right to expand criminal prosecutions, <em>Sanges</em> and its subsequent applications have placed the responsibility for such assertions of authority over citizens in the democratically elected Legislature, where it belongs.  Congress has properly assumed this responsibility by first defining, and then broadening and clarifying, the Federal Government\'s right to appeal an adverse criminal judgment. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 451 U. S. 248</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The concern to restrict prosecuting authority to express congressional grants, however, does not justify a requirement of express authorization by <em>Congress</em> when the sovereign seeking to appeal is a State, rather than the Federal Government.  Nothing in the language or logic of the <em>Sanges</em> opinion contains any suggestion of that kind.  Nor should such an intimation be read into the Court\'s subsequent decisions adhering to <em>Sanges\'</em> principle. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  For the purposes of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 451 U. S. 249</a></p><p> congressional restriction of prosecution by the sovereign, the Federal Executive, not the State, is the relevant sovereign.  The decision to limit or extend a State\'s appellate authority is a matter of state law within constitutional constraints.  If a State wishes to empower its prosecutors to pursue a criminal appeal under certain conditions, it is free so to provide, limited only by the guarantees afforded the criminal defendant under the Constitution.  Requiring Congress also to address explicitly the State\'s authority contributes nothing to the policy concerns that prompt the requirement of express sovereign action.  There is, in short, no basis for concluding that Congress\' neglect specifically to authorize a state appeal in a removed criminal proceeding impairs the appellate rights of the state prosecutor acting to enforce his separate body of criminal law.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court\'s prior decisions restricting the availability of \xc2\xa7 1291 in a criminal context flow from a tradition of requiring that a prosecutorial appeal be affirmatively sanctioned by the same sovereign that sponsors the prosecution.  The intention to restrict sovereign power in this area is adequately addressed when the legislature responsible for that power has spoken in express terms, or when a legislative enactment has been authoritatively construed by the sovereign\'s highest court.  We conclude that \xc2\xa7 1291 neither compels nor forecloses appellate jurisdiction in an appeal taken by a State as prosecutor.  Instead, the provision permits a State to appeal if it is authorized to do so by state law.  Petitioner Arizona can rely on \xc2\xa7 1291 combined with appellate authorization from the Arizona Legislature.

Because Arizona law conferred such authority here, and because removal does not alter the nature of the authority conferred, the State must be allowed to appeal from the post-guilty-verdict judgment of acquittal.  Accordingly, the judgment of the United States Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Sweetwater Pass is located about 29 miles southeast of Ajo, Ariz.

Petitioner argues that this intent should inform our deliberations concerning a state prosecution\'s appellate rights upon removal to federal court.  A proper respect for the State\'s interest in enforcing its own criminal laws, however, counsels against that conclusion.  While the policy announced in \xc2\xa7 3731 might perhaps be viewed as indicative of congressional support for any prosecutor\'s appeal in federal court, the statute does not speak in such terms.  Moreover, if \xc2\xa7 3731 is construed to extend broad appellate rights to a State that does not authorize comparable rights under state law, one result might be to inhibit the exercise of the removal right, contrary to established federal policy.  In light of these uncertainties, and our resolution of the case on other grounds, we do not reach the question whether \xc2\xa7 3731 applies to the States.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>Congress, from the very beginning, provided that final civil judgments were reviewable as a matter of statutory right.

Soper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/case.html">270 U. S. 9</a></span> (1926).  There this Court awarded Maryland mandamus relief after the State had challenged the legality of removing a particular criminal prosecution to federal court.  In general, this decision supports the ability of a State to secure review in a removed criminal prosecution.  Moreover, the decision held simply that mandamus was appropriate in the absence of any other means of reviewing the District Court\'s order refusing remand.  Respondent and the dissent seek to rely on the Court\'s further statement in <em>Soper,</em> 270 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/case.html#30">270 U.

Although this statement is merely dictum, to respondent and the dissent, it implies that a state prosecutor lacks congressional authorization to take an appeal in federal court.  We, however, adopt what we view as a more sensible reading, namely, that the Court\'s statement reflects an awareness of controlling double jeopardy doctrine, which, at the time, was thought to protect a defendant once a judgment of acquittal had been entered in federal court.  <em>See, e.g., Kepner v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/195/100/case.html">195 U.

Since this Court had earlier assumed, without deciding, that the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment applied to state prosecutions, <em>see Dreyer v.

Of course, the decision in <em>Soper</em> could hardly reflect awareness that, 11 years later, the Court would decline to extend Fifth Amendment double jeopardy protection in prosecutions brought by a State.  <em>See Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span> (1937), <em>overruled by Benton v.

Thus, while Arizona\'s authorization of appellate review by certiorari has no precise analogue in the federal system, it is necessary to choose from among the available forms of federal review.  As noted above, Arizona law authorizing review for abuse of discretion is administered in a sufficiently routine manner as to be more akin to ordinary federal appellate review than to the federal mandamus remedy reserved for extraordinary circumstances.  We express no view regarding the correct federal analogue for a State with a right of review that is more limited than that afforded by Arizona law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T27" name="F27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>We have no occasion to address the situation where state law does not authorize the review sought by its prosecutor in federal court.  We note, however, that, in the majority of States, the prosecution possesses at least some rights to appeal from an adverse judgment in a criminal case.  <em>See</em> Note, Limited Right of Appeal for the State, 14 Hous.L.Rev. 735, 737 (1977).  Similarly, because we find that appellate jurisdiction exists under \xc2\xa7 1291 combined with relevant Arizona law, we do not decide the applicability of \xc2\xa7 3731 to the States.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F18" name="T18">n</a> 18, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>The dissent suggests that this case presents an anomalous circumstance.

I therefore agree with the Court\'s conclusion that the holding in <em>United States v. Sanges,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/310/case.html">144 U. S. 310</a></span>, to the effect that a federal prosecutor had no such authority in 1892, is not controlling in this case.  The controlling authority is conferred by Arizona, which does empower its prosecutors to appeal in the situation presented here.</p>\n<p>Although this simple analysis persuades me to join the Court\'s opinion, I write separately to emphasize that it lends no support to an argument that 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3731, or any other federal statute, would authorize an appeal by a state prosecutor.</p>\n<p>* Title 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291 provides in part:</p>\n<p>"The courts of appeals shall have jurisdiction of appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States. . . ."</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BRENNAN, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Sanges,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/310/case.html">144 U. S. 310</a></span> (1892), announced the general rule that governments may not appeal in criminal cases in the federal courts in the absence of express statutory authority.  Finding, <em>inter alia,</em> that the predecessor to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1291 was not sufficiently express, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] <em>Sanges</em> refused to allow an appeal by the Federal Government.  Today, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 451 U.

Because this result flouts Congress\' authority to regulate the jurisdiction of the lower federal courts, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court proposes the novel interpretation of <em>Sanges</em> and its progeny as</p>\n<p>"flow[ing] from a tradition of requiring that a prosecutorial appeal be affirmatively sanctioned by the same sovereign that sponsors the prosecution."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/232/case.html#249">451 U. S. 249</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  I find this reading of the <em>Sanges</em> rule inaccurate:  in my view, <em>Sanges</em> plainly requires express authorization from the legislative body controlling federal court jurisdiction for all government appeals in criminal cases in the federal courts. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The Court stated that the express authorization must be made by the legislature "acting within its constitutional authority."  144 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/144/310/case.html#318">144 U. S. 318</a></span>.  Since Congress is the only entity constitutionally empowered to grant express authority for government appeals in the federal courts, the <em>Sanges</em> principle necessarily confines our inquiry to whether there is express authorization in federal statutes controlling criminal appeals by the States in federal court.  Therefore, the Court\'s finding that Arizona, the sovereign sponsoring the prosecution in the instant case, has sanctioned prosecutorial appeals in its courts is irrelevant to the question of federal appellate jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 451 U. S. 253</a></p><p> here.  Focusing as we must on federal statutes, I find the pertinent federal statutes wholly barren of any express authorization of criminal appeals by States to the federal courts of appeals. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Today, as in 1892, \xc2\xa7 1291</p>\n<p>"says nothing as to the party by whom the writ of error may be brought, and cannot therefore be presumed to have been intended to confer upon the government the right to bring [an appeal]."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 144 U.S. 323323.</p>\n<p>This conclusion is supported by <em>Maryland v. Soper,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/case.html">270 U. S. 9</a></span> (1926), which relied on the <em>Sanges</em> rule to conclude that a State has no right of appeal from a decision of a federal district court in a criminal case removed from state court.  In <em>Soper,</em> four United States prohibition agents and their chauffeur were indicted for murder in the State of Maryland.  The defendants petitioned the Federal District Court for removal, averring that they were federal agents [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and that their acts "were done in the discharge of their official duties as prohibition agents."  270 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/case.html#22">270 U. S. 22</a></span>.  The District Court granted defendants\' petition, and the State subsequently applied to this Court for a writ of mandamus to overturn the removal order.  Over respondent\'s objection that mandamus did not lie to correct an erroneous removal order, this Court granted the writ.  Observing that "there should be a more liberal use of mandamus [in removal of State criminal cases] than in removal of civil cases," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/270/9/case.html#29">270 U. S. 29</a></span>, the Court specifically noted:</p>\n<p>"Except by issue of mandamus, [the State] is without an opportunity to invoke the decision of this Court upon the issue it would raise.  The order of the United States District Judge refusing to remand is not open to review </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 451 U.

Significantly, the predecessor to \xc2\xa7 1291 was available then, as it is now, to support an argument that the State had a right of appeal.  Nonetheless, on the strength of <em>Sanges,</em> the Court concluded that a judgment of acquittal was unreviewable [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] because there was no express <em>federal</em> statute authorizing an appeal by the State.  <em>See Government of Virgin Islands v. Hamilton,</em> 475 F.2d 529, 530-531 (CA3 1973).</p>\n<p>The Court attempts to deflect the force of this precedent by interpreting <em>Maryland v.

S. 248</a></span>, n. 25.  But this is a clearly incorrect reading, for it ignores the fact that, at the time <em>Maryland v. Soper</em> was decided, the prohibition contained in the Fifth Amendment\'s Double Jeopardy Clause was applicable only against the <em>Federal Government in federal prosecutions,</em> and not against <em>state governments in state prosecutions.</em> <em>See Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span> (1937). [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  It was not until 32 years later that <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/case.html">Benton</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 451 U.

Since the Double Jeopardy Clause did not apply to prosecutions initiated by the States, and state substantive law governed criminal cases removed to federal district court, <em>Tennessee v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html">100 U. S. 257</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/257/case.html#271">100 U.

Soper</em> referred to double jeopardy limitations is plainly unfounded.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even on its own terms, the Court\'s opinion is unpersuasive.  The Court concludes that appeals by the States are permissible under \xc2\xa7 1291</p>\n<p>"when the legislature responsible for that power has spoken in express terms, or when a legislative enactment has been authoritatively construed by the sovereign\'s highest court."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/232/case.html#249">451 U. S. 249</a></span>.  The Arizona statute supposedly authorizing appeal, however, is anything but "express."  That statute provides:</p>\n<p>"The writ of certiorari <em>may be granted</em> by the supreme and superior courts or by any judge thereof, in all cases when an inferior tribunal, board or officer, exercising judicial functions, has exceeded its jurisdiction and there is no appeal, nor, in the judgment of the court, a plain, speedy and adequate remedy."</p>\n<p>Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 12-2001 (1956) (emphasis added).  The State may obtain a writ of certiorari by filing a petition for special action pursuant to Rule 4, Rules of Procedure for Special Actions, vol. 17A, Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. (1973).</p>\n<p>If it be true the State\'s petition for review "has been routinely granted" by the appellate courts, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/232/case.html#240">451 U. S. 240</a></span>, this hardly qualifies as an authoritative construction by the State\'s highest court that the <em>statute itself</em> authorizes review in every case.  The Court has failed to cite a single precedent in which the Arizona Supreme Court has investigated the intent of the state legislature in passing the statute authorizing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 451 U. S. 256</a></p><p> prosecutorial appeals.  More importantly, by relying on state court decisions allowing certiorari review on behalf of the State, the Court has undercut the only rationale justifying today\'s result.  The Court reasons:</p>\n<p>"Our continuing refusal to assume that the United States possesses any inherent right to appeal reflects an abiding concern to check the Federal Government\'s possible misuse of its enormous prosecutorial powers.  By insisting that Congress speak with a clear voice when extending to the Executive a right to expand criminal prosecutions, <em>Sanges</em> and its subsequent applications have placed the responsibility for such assertions of authority over citizens in the democratically elected legislature, where it belongs."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">451 U.

S. 257</a></p><p> "express" -- to a construction of \xc2\xa7 1291 as an express grant of authority for state appeals, <em>without reference to state statutes.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court has noted time and again that appeals by the government in criminal cases are exceptional, and not favored.  <em>E.g., Will v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html">389 U. S. 90</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html#96">389 U. S. 96</a></span>-97 (1967); <em>DiBella v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/121/case.html#130">369 U. S. 130</a></span>; <em>Carroll v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/394/case.html#400">354 U. S. 400</a></span>.  I would have thought, therefore, that the Court would be especially careful before concluding that Congress intended that \xc2\xa7 1291 would authorize criminal appeals by the State in removal cases. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  <em>See Will v. United States, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/90/case.html#96">389 U. S. 96</a></span>-97 ("the Criminal Appeals Act is strictly construed against the Government\'s right of appeal").  Instead, the Court has abandoned its traditional presumption in this area to imply -- on the strength of its own policy analysis -- authorization for a state appeal in a criminal case where no federal statute expressly authorizes one.  But</p>\n<p>"[i]t is axiomatic . . . that the existence of appellate jurisdiction in a specific federal court over a given type of case is dependent upon authority expressly conferred by statute.  And since the jurisdictional statutes prevailing at any given time are so much a product of the whole history of both growth and limitation of federal court jurisdiction . . . , they have always been interpreted in the light of that history, and of the axiom that clear statutory mandate must exist to found jurisdiction."</p>\n<p><em>Carroll v.
