JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Petitioners, recipients of public assistance under the cooperative federal-state Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] brought this action in the District Court for themselves and their infant children and as representatives of other similarly situated AFDC recipients.  Their suit challenged a provision of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 415 U. S. 531</a></p><p> the New York Code of Rules and Regulations permitting the State to recoup prior unscheduled payments for rent from subsequent grants under the AFDC program. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They alleged that the recoupment regulation violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and contravened the pertinent provisions of the Social Security Act governing AFDC and the regulations promulgated thereunder by the administering federal agency, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The action sought injunctive and declaratory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 415 U. S. 532</a></p><p> relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2201, and jurisdiction was invoked under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1343(3) and (4).  The District Court found that the equal protection claim was substantial, and provided a basis for pendent jurisdiction to adjudicate the so-called "statutory" claim -- the alleged conflict between state and federal law.  After hearing, the trial court declared the recoupment regulation contrary to the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, and enjoined its implementation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 415 U. S. 533</a></p><p> or enforcement.  Following a remand, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the Court of Appeals reversed, holding that, because petitioners had failed to present a substantial constitutional claim, the District Court lacked jurisdiction to entertain either the equal protection or the statutory claim.  471 F.2d 347 (CA2 1973).  The jurisdictional question being an important one, we granted certiorari.  412 U.S. 938 (1973).  For reasons set forth below, we hold that the District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3) to consider petitioners\' attack on the recoupment regulation. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 415 U. S. 534</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners brought this action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, which provides:</p>\n<p>"Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of any State </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 415 U. S. 535</a></p><p> or Territory, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, hall be liable to the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding for redress."</p>\n<p>By its terms, \xc2\xa7 1983 embraces petitioners\' claims that the challenged regulation enforced by respondent state and county welfare officials deprives them of a right "secured by the Constitution and laws," <em>viz.,</em> the equal protection of the laws.  But the federal cause of action created by the section does not, by itself, confer jurisdiction upon the federal district courts to adjudicate these claims.  Accordingly, petitioners relied principally upon 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3):</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 415 U. S. 536</a></p><p> of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States. . . ."</p>\n<p>Concededly, \xc2\xa7 1343 authorizes a civil action to "redress the deprivation, under color of any State . . . regulation . . . of any right . . . secured by the Constitution of the United States."  Section 1343(3) therefore conferred jurisdiction upon the District Court to entertain the constitutional claim if it was of sufficient substance to support federal jurisdiction.  If it was, it is also clear that the District Court could hear as a matter of pendent jurisdiction the claim of conflict between federal and state law, without determining that the latter claim in its own right was encompassed within \xc2\xa7 1343.  <em>Rosado v.

The principle applied by the Court of Appeals -- that a "substantial" question was necessary to support jurisdiction -- was unexceptionable under prior cases.  Over the years, this Court has repeatedly held that the federal courts are without power to entertain claims otherwise within their jurisdiction if they are "so attenuated and unsubstantial as to be absolutely devoid of merit," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/193/561/case.html">Newburyport Water Co. v.

Nevertheless, the coincidence of a constitutional and statutory claim should not automatically require a single-judge district court to defer to a three-judge panel, which, in view of what we have said in <em>Rosado v.

Gibbs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html">383 U. S. 715</a></span> (1966), is claimed to have over the pendent federal claim.  But <em>Gibbs</em> was oriented to state law claims pendent to federal claims conferring jurisdiction on the District Court.

It has been suggested, for example, that the conflict question is itself a constitutional matter within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1343(3).  <em>Connecticut Union of Welfare Employees v. White,</em> 55 F.R.D. 481, 486 (Conn.1972).  For purposes of interpreting and applying 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2281, the three-judge court provision, a claim of conflict between federal and state law has been denominated a claim not requiring a three-judge court.  <em>Swift &amp; Co. v. Wickham,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/111/case.html">382 U. S. 111</a></span> (1965).  But <em>Swift</em> itself recognized that a suit to have a state statute declared void and to secure the benefits of the federal statute with which the state law is allegedly in conflict cannot succeed without ultimate resort to the Federal Constitution --</p>\n<p>"to be sure, any determination that a state statute is void for obstructing a federal statute does rest on the Supremacy Clause of the Federal Constitution."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/382/111/case.html#125">382 U.

Moreover, when we have previously determined that state AFDC laws do not conform to the Social Security Act or HEW regulations, they have been invalidated under the Supremacy Clause.  <em>See Townsend v. Swank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/282/case.html">404 U. S. 282</a></span>, 286 (1971).  It is therefore urged that the "secured by the Constitution" language of \xc2\xa7 1343(3) should not be construed to exclude Supremacy Clause issues.  That question we leave for another day.</p>\n<p>Petitioners contend that \xc2\xa7 1983 authorizes suits to vindicate rights under the "laws" of the United States, as well as under the Constitution, and that a suit brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 to vindicate a statutory right under the Social Security Act, is a suit under an Act of Congress "providing for the protection of civil rights, including the right to vote" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1343(4).  They further argue that, in any event, \xc2\xa7 1343(3) in particular, and \xc2\xa7 1343 in general, should be construed to invest the district courts with jurisdiction to hear any suit authorized by \xc2\xa7 1983.  These issues we also do not reach.  <em>See Rosado v. Wyman,</em> 397 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#405">397 U.

In <em>Cooper v.

The court found the regulation inconsistent with the Social Security Act for several reasons, including, <em>inter alia,</em> the punishment of the dependent child by depriving him of a substantial amount of his AFDC assistance because his mother either mistakenly or fraudulently obtained an extra payment months ago.</p>\n<p>"[T]he state cannot justify its [arbitrary] method of restitution by asserting that proper management of funds would produce such a [cash] reserve.

Measuring the regulation against the goals of the AFDC program, the court invalidated it as inconsistent with federal law.</p>\n<p>"The primary concern of Congress in establishing the AFDC program was the welfare and protection of the needy dependent child.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 601; <em>King v.

The child-oriented policy of the AFDC program requires that children with equal needs be treated equally.

Parham,</em> 340 F.Supp. 336 (ND Ga.1972), an equal protection and due process challenge to a Georgia statute mandating recoupment from future grants for past unlawful payments was deemed substantial enough to warrant the convening of a three-judge court.  Addressing the pendent claim of inconsistency with the Social Security Act and HEW regulations, the court ruled that the law was valid because it required a pre-recoupment determination that all or part of the overpayments are currently available to the parent and the children.</p>\n<p>Although it did not explore the question in depth, the first Court of Appeals panel in this case that passed upon the injunction found jurisdiction in the District Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3) on the authority of the Court\'s decision in <em>Carter v.

Since the state has a limited amount of funds available to allocate to welfare recipients, the recoupment regulation is reasonably designed to ensure that there are sufficient funds available to all recipients on the level set by the state legislature.  By receiving the advance payment plaintiffs have gotten more than the normal grant.  Without the recoupment regulation, the plaintiffs would be in a preferred position over all the other welfare recipients who have paid their full rent out of the normal grant.  The purposes of equal protection are served by treating all alike, without granting special favor to those who have misappropriated their rent allowance.  If there were no recoupment provision, there would be a disincentive for welfare recipients to manage their grants so as to have funds available to pay their rent each month.  The recoupment provision encourages proper money management, an entirely acceptable, if incidental, purpose of the welfare legislation."</p>\n<p>"No doubt there are other ways in which the state could accomplish the ends served by the use of the recoupment regulation.  However it is not for us to evaluate the wisdom of the state\'s choice of means.

Jurisdiction was invoked under the Jones Act (46 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 688) and under general federal question (28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331) and diversity (28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1332) jurisdiction.  After expressing its view that petitioner alleged a Jones Act claim substantial enough to confer jurisdiction under that statute, the Court held that his general maritime law claims were not cognizable under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331.  By no means, however, was this the end of the inquiry.</p>\n<p>"[T]he District Court may have jurisdiction of [petitioner\'s general maritime law claims] \'pendent\' to its jurisdiction under the Jones Act.

Oursler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/289/238/case.html">289 U.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST because I believe he expresses the correct view of the appropriate result when a claim over which a district court has no independent jurisdiction is appended to a constitutional claim that has no hope of success on the merits.  A wise exercise of discretion lies at the heart of the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction.  <em>E.g., Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#403">397 U. S. 403</a></span> (1970); <em>Mine Workers v.

S. 726</a></span>-727 (1966).  Compelling a district court to decide an ancillary claim where the premise for its jurisdiction is a meritless constitutional claim does not impress me as an efficacious performance of a discretionary responsibility. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 415 U. S. 551</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I write briefly to emphasize my view that the majority has misread the import of the <em>Gibbs</em> opinion, <em>supra,</em> particularly in the manner in which it links <em>Gibbs</em> to <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/213/175/case.html">213 U. S. 175</a></span> (1909), and like cases.  <em>Gibbs</em> involved a state claim that arose out of the same transaction as the federal law claim that conferred federal jurisdiction.  The majority apparently reads <em>Gibbs</em> and <em>Siler</em> together as mandating decision of the state law claim without regard to the frailty of the federal claim on which federal jurisdiction rests.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html#547">415 U. S. 547</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html#549">415 U. S. 549</a></span>-550.  In other words, the majority opinion appears to be saying that a federal constitutional claim as marginal as the one at issue here is capable of supporting pendent federal jurisdiction over a state claim and, indeed, that the state claim is to be decided to the exclusion of the federal issue.  As I view it, that is a particularly erroneous interpretation of the pendent jurisdiction doctrine.  That reading would broaden federal question jurisdiction to encompass matters of state law whenever an imaginative litigant can think up a federal claim, no matter how insubstantial, that is related to the transaction giving rise to the state claim.</p>\n<p>This extension of <em>Gibbs</em> is quite unnecessary, since we are not confronted with a case where the pendent claim is a matter of state law.  The Court\'s dictum could  nevertheless prompt other courts to follow it.  In view of this potential mischief, I repeat a quotation from <em>Gibbs</em> relied on by my Brother REHNQUIST which indicates how far the Court has departed from the rationale of that 1966 precedent:</p>\n<p>"[R]ecognition of a federal court\'s wide latitude to decide ancillary questions of state law does not imply that it must tolerate a litigant\'s effort to impose upon it what is in effect only a state law case.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="552">Page 415 U. S. 552</a></p><p> Once it appears that a state claim constitutes the real body of a case, to which the federal claim is only an appendage, the state claim may fairly be dismissed."</p>\n<p>383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#727">383 U. S. 727</a></span>.  The correct reading of <em>Gibbs,</em> as a matter of common sense and in light of deeply rooted notions of federalism, is that the federal claim must have more than a glimmer of merit, and must continue to do so at least until substantial judicial resources have been committed to the lawsuit.  If either of those conditions is not met, a district court has no business deciding issues of state law.  District courts are not expositors of state law when jurisdiction is not based on diversity of citizenship.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE POWELL join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision in this case resolves a legal question and is necessarily and properly cast in legal terms.  According to the Court, a federal district court, having acquired jurisdiction over a "not wholly insubstantial" federal claim, has power to decide other related claims which lack an independent jurisdictional basis.  Applying this analysis to the present case, the Court finds the equal protection claim pleaded by petitioners sufficient to satisfy this somewhat hazy definition of "substantiality," and appears to approve the District Court\'s exercise of pendent jurisdiction over a claim alleging conflict between state and federal welfare regulations.  But since we have been admonished that we may not shut our eyes as judges to what we know as men, the practical as well as the legal consequences of this decision should be squarely faced.</p>\n<p>In the wake of <em>King v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/309/case.html">392 U. S. 309</a></span> (1968), and <em>Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span> (1970), the lower federal courts have been confronted by a massive influx of cases challenging state welfare regulations.  The principal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 415 U. S. 553</a></p><p> claim of plaintiffs in the typical case is that the state regulation conflicts with governing federal regulations, and is invalid under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.  This allegation presents a federal claim sufficient to satisfy the first jurisdictional requirement of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] the so-called "federal question" jurisdictional statute, but many plaintiffs find the statute\'s second requirement, that the matter in controversy exceed the sum of $10,000, impossible to meet.  Normally, therefore, these cases would be left, as Congress surely understood when it imposed this jurisdictional limitation, to state courts likewise charged with enforcing the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>To avoid this natural disposition, however, plaintiffs in these cases have turned to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, a more narrowly drawn federal jurisdictional statute requiring no minimum jurisdictional amount.  The provision of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343 relevant to this case reads:</p>\n<p>"The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of any civil action authorized by law to be commenced by any person:"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(3) To redress the deprivation, under color of any State law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom or usage, of any right, privilege or immunity secured by the Constitution of the United States or by any Act of Congress providing for equal rights of citizens or of all persons within the jurisdiction of the United States. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="554">Page 415 U. S. 554</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This Court, however, has never held, and does not hold now, that the Supremacy Clause of the Constitution itself provides a basis for jurisdiction under this section.  The Court escapes the need for such a decision by granting the federal courts power to hear the Supremacy Clause claim under a theory of pendent jurisdiction.  Finding that plaintiffs here have pleaded an equal protection claim sufficiently substantial to satisfy the requirements of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343, the Court seems to suggest that consideration of the Supremacy Clause claim may follow as a matter of course.  Since I do not believe that the equal protection claim was sufficient to establish jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 1343, or that the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction was appropriately invoked in this case, I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The history of pendent jurisdiction in this Court is long and complex.  Its roots go back to <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html">Osborn v. Bank of the United States,</a></span></em> 9 Wheat. 738 (1824), where the Court said that the jurisdiction of the federal courts extended not only to federal issues themselves, but also to nonfederal issues essential to the settlement of the federal claim.  No subsequent decision has cast any doubt upon the wisdom of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\'s exposition in that case, since a different result would have forced substantial federal cases into state courts for adjudication simply because they involved nonfederal issues as well as federal ones. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The doctrine was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="555">Page 415 U. S. 555</a></p><p> expanded in <em>Siler v. Louisville &amp; Nashville R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/213/175/case.html">213 U. S. 175</a></span> (1909), where the Court upheld the power of a district court, having founded its jurisdiction upon federal constitutional claims, to bypass the constitutional questions and to decide an issue of local law.  The Court said that the lower court</p>\n<p>"had the right to decide all the questions in the case, even though it decided the Federal questions adversely to the party raising them, or even if it omitted to decide them at all, but decided the case on local or state questions only. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]"</p>\n<p>But the Court at the same time cautioned:</p>\n<p>"Of course, the Federal question must not be merely colorable or fraudulently set up for the mere purpose of endeavoring to give the court jurisdiction. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 415 U. S. 556</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court returned to the question of pendent jurisdiction in <em>Hurn v. Oursler,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/238/case.html">289 U. S. 238</a></span> (1933), and <em>Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/103/case.html">289 U. S. 103</a></span> (1933).  The Court in both cases agreed that a substantial federal question was necessary to confer initial jurisdiction on the district court, [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] a test that must be met whether or not pendent jurisdiction is involved, and then, in <em>Hurn,</em> further attempted to define the necessary relationship between the pendent claim and the claim conferring jurisdiction.  According to the Court, a lower federal court could exercise pendent jurisdiction over a separate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 415 U. S. 557</a></p><p> <em>ground</em> alleged in support of a single cause of action, but not over a separate cause of action itself. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s most recent extensive treatment of the subject occurred in <em>Mine Workers v. Gibbs,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html">383 U. S. 715</a></span> (1966).  Because <em>Hurn</em> had spoken in terms of "causes of action," a term which was superseded by the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, <em>Gibbs</em> redefined the necessary relation of the federal and nonfederal claims in more understandable terms.  Restating the substantiality test in pretty much the language of the earlier cases, the Court then continued:</p>\n<p>"The state and federal claims must derive from a common nucleus of operative fact.  But if, considered without regard to their federal or state character, a plaintiff\'s claims are such that he would ordinarily be expected to try them all in one judicial proceeding, then, assuming substantiality of the federal issues there is <em>power</em> in federal courts to hear the whole."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#725">383 U. S. 725</a></span> (footnote omitted) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>This language served to clarify jurisdictional questions which had proved troublesome after <em>Hurn v. Oursler.</em>  But, importantly, the decision then went on to emphasize </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 415 U. S. 558</a></p><p> that power to hear claims lacking an independent jurisdictional basis should not be exercised indiscriminately.  The Court reiterated that "pendent jurisdiction is a doctrine of discretion, not of plaintiff\'s right," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#726">383 U. S. 726</a></span>, and urged that the district courts exercise caution not to abuse that discretion.  For example, the Court suggested that</p>\n<p>"if the federal claims are dismissed before trial, even though not insubstantial in a jurisdictional sense, the state claims should be dismissed as well."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (footnote omitted).  Furthermore, the Court stressed that the relative importance of the claims should be considered:</p>\n<p>"Similarly, if it appears that the state issues substantially predominate, whether, in terms of proof, of the scope of the issues raised, or of the comprehensiveness of the remedy sought the state claims may be dismissed without prejudice and left for resolution to state tribunals."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#726">383 U. S. 726</a></span>-727.</p>\n<p>Although the Court\'s language in <em>Gibbs</em> necessarily discussed the relationship between federal and state claims, much of the opinion\'s rationale is applicable when pendent jurisdiction is sought over federal claims lacking an independent jurisdictional basis. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  Of course, a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 415 U. S. 559</a></p><p> decision to deny pendent jurisdiction on the ground that state courts should consider questions of state law naturally involves issues relevant to the question of abstention, a consideration not especially applicable when the pendent claim primarily involves questions of federal law.  But the presence of federal questions should not induce federal courts to expand their proper jurisdiction.  As previously noted, Congress, by requiring a minimum dollar amount for federal question jurisdiction, made a legislative decision to leave certain claims to state courts.  Considerations of convenience and judicial economy may justify hearing those claims when genuine federal business, as contrasted to weak claims intended merely to secure jurisdiction, is before the federal court, but these considerations should be subordinated to considerations of federalism when the claims without independent jurisdiction constitute "the real body" of the case.  In this situation the lower courts should remember that federalism embodies</p>\n<p>"a system in which there is sensitivity to the legitimate interests of both State and National Governments, and in which the National Government, anxious though it may be to vindicate and protect federal rights and federal interests, always endeavors to do so in ways that will not unduly interfere with the legitimate activities of the States."</p>\n<p><em>Younger v. Harris,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html">401 U. S. 37</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/case.html#44">401 U. S. 44</a></span> (1971).</p>\n<p>The majority rejects this analysis, seemingly finding that state courts\' greater familiarity with state law is the only reason for declining pendent jurisdiction under <em>Gibbs.</em>  But Congress left to state courts not only those claims involving state law, but also those claims involving federal law which it felt did not merit the time of federal courts.  This Court now says that federal courts should hear those cases anyway, since they can </p><p><a class="page-number" name="560">Page 415 U. S. 560</a></p><p> render "at least as sure-footed" an interpretation of federal law, and are "<em>particularly appropriate bodies\'" to do so.  This opinion, while it undoubtedly reflects the view of this Court, does not reflect with equal accuracy the purpose of Congress.\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Rosado v. Wyman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html">397 U. S. 397</a></span> (1970), heavily relied upon by the Court to support its position, there was no intimation that the constitutional claim was a weak one pleaded for the purpose of securing federal jurisdiction over a stronger claim.  Rather, the constitutional claim proved moot.  This Court plainly stated:</p>\n<p>"Unlike insubstantiality, which is apparent at the outset, mootness, frequently a matter beyond the control of the parties, may not occur until after substantial time and energy have been expended looking toward the resolution of a dispute that plaintiffs were entitled to bring in a federal court."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/397/case.html#404">397 U. S. 404</a></span>  Thus, <em>Rosado</em> does not in any way settle the issue before the Court today.  Its holding offers no aid in resolving the real and practical issues that the Court confronts in this case.</p>\n<p>The <em>Gibbs</em> decision must be understood in its separate parts.  First, the Court held that jurisdiction could not attach unless the claim for which jurisdiction was asserted met the requirement of substantiality and unless the pendent claim was sufficiently related to the jurisdictional claim to constitute a single case under the Constitution.  Second, the Court admonished that this jurisdiction, even if found to exist, should be exercised judiciously.  The relatively permissive standards applied to the issue of whether the Court could consider a pendent claim were not to guide the ultimate decision of whether the Court should consider the pendent claim.  Only where "considerations of judicial economy, convenience </p><p><a class="page-number" name="561">Page 415 U. S. 561</a></p><p> and fairness to litigants" were served, and where the pendent claim did not predominate in scope or worth over the judicial claim, was the doctrine of pendent jurisdiction to be applied.  383 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/383/715/case.html#726">383 U. S. 726</a></span>.  While I am convinced that the District Court lacked jurisdiction over an equal protection claim as thin as this one, even if I am wrong on that point, it seems clear to me that its decision to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the Supremacy Clause claim was not based on the discretionary considerations outlined in <em>Gibbs, supra.</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court simply found the equal protection claim in this case to be "substantial," and proceeded without further discussion to the statutory claim.  The Court of Appeals, reversing the determination of the District Court, found the claim to be insubstantial, and therefore had no need to go further.  This Court merely disagrees on the question of substantiality, reinstating the District Court\'s jurisdiction.  Unfortunately, this process of analysis seems to me to be wrong both in its treatment of the jurisdictional question and in its failure to treat the discretionary aspects of pendent jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>Whatever legal terminology is applied to the equal protection claim of the plaintiffs in this case, the one clear fact is that the claim is not very good.  In brief, petitioners, who are recipients of public assistance under the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, all received funds from New York, over and above their usual monthly grants, to prevent eviction from their places of lodging for nonpayment of rent.  The State, pursuant to a provision of the New York Code of Rules and Regulations challenged in the District Court, sought to recover these unusual expenditures by making deductions over the next succeeding months from petitioners\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="562">Page 415 U. S. 562</a></p><p> normal monthly grants.  In their complaint, petitioners contended that the New York recoupment procedure deprived them of equal protection of the laws. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>One searches in vain, either in petitioners\' brief or in the opinions of the District Court or this Court, for any reason why this claim meets even a minimal test of substantiality.  It would seem extraordinary if, having paid petitioners more than their normal monthly entitlement in order to meet an emergency situation, the State had not sought to recoup the payments over a period of time.  The District Court, finding the claim substantial, cited <em>Bradford v. Juras,</em> 331 F.Supp. 167 (Ore.1971), a decision by a three-judge district court which found jurisdiction on a similar constitutional claim and then decided the case on statutory grounds.  In <em>Bradford,</em> however, the Court simply stated that it had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1343(3), without further discussion. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>The opinion of this Court sheds no more light than did the opinion of the District Court.  The Court simply states:</p>\n<p>"This reasoning with respect to the rationality of the regulation and its propriety under the Equal Protection Clause may ultimately prove correct, but it is not immediately obvious from the decided cases </p><p><a class="page-number" name="563">Page 415 U. S. 563</a></p><p> or so \'very plain\' under the Equal Protection Clause."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/528/case.html#542">415 U. S. 542</a></span>.  But cases such as <em>Dandridge v. Williams,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/471/case.html">397 U. S. 471</a></span> (1970), have largely discredited attacks on legislative decisions about the apportionment of limited state welfare funds.  At least where the Court has not found a penalty based on race or considerations such as interstate travel, the legislative judgment is upheld whenever a "conceivable rational basis" exists.  Although <em>Dandridge</em> did not "suspend the operation of the Equal Protection Clause" in this area, it assuredly makes this particular claim a marginal one. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>I therefore cannot agree that the equal protection claim pleaded here was sufficient to confer jurisdiction on the District Court.  Even assuming that the lower court may refer only to the pleadings in making its determination on the question of jurisdiction, the analysis need not be made, as the majority seems to imply, in a legal vacuum.  To say that previous decisions have not foreclosed a question unless a prior case "specifically deal[s]" with the same regulation neglects the second branch of the test enunciated in <em>Levering &amp; Garrigues Co. v. Morrin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/103/case.html">289 U. S. 103</a></span> (1933), and repeated in later cases, that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="564">Page 415 U. S. 564</a></p><p> claim is insubstantial because "obviously without merit."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/289/103/case.html#105">289 U. S. 105</a></span>.  Under today\'s rationale, it appears sufficient for jurisdiction that a plaintiff is able to plead his claim with a straight face.  But a district court should be able to dismiss for want of jurisdiction any claim that plainly carries no hope of success on the merits.  This lack of promise, in turn, could be evident from recent decisions of this Court rejecting claims with a similar thesis or laying down rules which would clearly require dismissal on the merits.</p>\n<p>Assuming, however, that the District Court here did have jurisdiction, it seems clear to me that, under <em>Gibbs,</em> the equal protection claim should not support the Supremacy Clause claim also asserted by petitioners.  The test for exercising discretion must be a practical one, involving the type of judgments that a reasonable lawyer, evaluating the respective strengths and weaknesses of his case, might undertake.  In this case, it is highly improbable that a lawyer familiar with this Court\'s cases would place much faith in the success of his equal protection claim.  In fact, examination of the complaint itself shows that substantially more attention was paid to the Supremacy Clause claim than to the claims under the Fourteenth Amendment.  At the very least, the District Court, before it chose to exercise pendent jurisdiction, should have made an identifiable determination that the Equal Protection Clause was not simply asserted for the purpose of giving the Court jurisdiction over the heart of the plaintiffs\' case.  To my mind, this seems to be a classic case of the statutory tail wagging the constitutional dog.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Thus, even if the Court of Appeals may have erroneously resolved the question of jurisdiction, the result it reached was correct in terms of the wise exercise of jurisdiction.  Whether the equal protection claim pleaded in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="565">Page 415 U. S. 565</a></p><p> this case meets the threshold of substantiality for jurisdiction in the federal courts, the claim surely should not convince a district court that its main purpose was anything other than to secure jurisdiction for he more promising Supremacy Clause claim.  Presented with this situation, the District Court should have declined to exercise pendent jurisdiction over the Supremacy Clause claim and referred the equal protection claim to a three-judge court. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  Since its failure to do so seems to me an abuse of discretion under <em>Gibbs,</em> I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The relevant provision of 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1331 reads as follows:</p>\n<p>"(a) The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions wherein the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $10,000, exclusive of interest and costs, and arises under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States."</p>\n<p>The jurisdictional amount was raised from $3,000 to 10,000 in 1958.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>"Under this construction, the judicial power of the Union extends effectively and beneficially to that most important class of cases which depend on the character of the cause.  On the opposite construction, the judicial power never can be extended to a whole case, as expressed by the constitution, but to those parts of cases only which present the particular question involving the construction of the constitution or the law.  We say it never can be extended to the whole case because, if the circumstance that other points are involved in it, shall disable Congress from authorizing the Courts of the Union to take jurisdiction of the original cause, it equally disables Congress from authorizing those Courts to take jurisdiction of the whole cause on an appeal, and thus will be restricted to a single question in that cause; and words obviously intended to secure to those who claim rights under the constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States a trial in the federal Courts will be restricted to the insecure remedy of an appeal upon an insulated point, after it has received that shape which may be given to it by another tribunal, into which he is forced against his will."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/22/738/case.html">Osborn v.

I cannot agree.  The numerous cases cited in the Court\'s opinion stand for the long-recognized and sensible policy that cases should be decided on nonconstitutional grounds where possible; but they do not stand for the proposition that claims which would be otherwise dismissed under the principles discussed in <em>Mine Workers v.

If the bill or the complaint sets forth a substantial claim, a case is presented within the federal jurisdiction, however the court, upon consideration, may decide as to the legal sufficiency of the facts alleged to support the claim.  But jurisdiction, as distinguished from merits, is wanting where the claim set forth in the pleading is plainly unsubstantial.  The cases have stated the rule in a variety of ways, but all to that effect. . . .

Pursuant to a stipulation between the parties, the case was then tried before a single judge on the issue of the claimed statutory conflict only.  <em>Goosby v. Osser,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/512/case.html">409 U. S. 512</a></span> (1973), specifies that a three-judge court must be convened to hear constitutional questions within its jurisdiction if they are "substantial."  It is true, of course, that federal courts commonly avoid deciding constitutional questions when alternative grounds for decision are available.  <em>See, e.g., Ashwander v. TVA,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html">297 U. S. 288</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/case.html#346">297 U. S. 346</a></span>-347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring).  But application of that principle to cases in which the constitutional claim is pleaded primarily to confer jurisdiction over a pendent claim would lead to circular reasoning.  Under that theory, a claim for which Congress provided no jurisdiction and which a single judge determined to be improperly brought into federal court would become a preferred ground for decision simply because the court wished to avoid the claim over which Congress granted jurisdiction in the first place.  To turn to the pendent claim when pendent jurisdiction is properly assumed under <em>Gibbs</em> may be appropriate, but the presence of a constitutional claim which might therefore be avoided should not, itself, be an independent basis for hearing the pendent claim.</p>\n<p>In rare cases, of course, a three-judge court may disagree with the single judge\'s view that a constitutional claim lacks merit, and resolve the constitutional issue in the plaintiff\'s favor.  At that point, the plaintiff will have his relief, and the case need go no further.  Concededly, a constitutional decision will have been rendered when a statutory decision might have been possible, but that cost, in the few cases where it is likely to arise, seems less expensive than the cost of allowing federal jurisdiction to be unnecessarily expanded.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
