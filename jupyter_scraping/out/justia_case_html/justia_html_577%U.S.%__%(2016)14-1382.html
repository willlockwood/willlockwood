Americold removed the suit to Federal District Court based on diversity-of-citizenship jurisdiction.  See 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(a)(1), 1441(b).  The District Court accepted jurisdiction and ruled in Americold\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit held that the District Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the suit.  Since Americold was not a corporation, the court reasoned, its citizenship for diversity jurisdiction purposes should be based on the citizenship of its members, which included its shareholders.  Because no record of those shareholders\xe2\x80\x99 citizenship existed, diversity was not proved.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0For purposes of diversity jurisdiction, Americold\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship is based on the citizenship of its members, which include its shareholders.

But for the limited exception of jurisdictional citizenship for corporations, see <i>Louisville, C. &amp; C. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson</i>, 2 How. 497, 558, this Court continues to \xe2\x80\x9cadhere to [the] oft-repeated rule that diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of \xe2\x80\x98all [its] members,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Carden</i> v. <i>Arkoma Associates</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185\n.  Applying the rule here, Americold possesses the citizenship of all its members, who, under Maryland law, include its shareholders.  See<i>, e.g.,</i> Md. Corp. &amp; Assns.

Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Americold argues that anything called a \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d possesses the citizenship of its trustees alone.  Traditionally, a trust was considered a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between multiple people and could not be haled into court; hence, legal proceedings involving a trust were brought by or against the trustees in their own name, <i>Deveaux</i>, 5 Cranch, at 91.  Americold confuses the traditional trust with the variety of unincorporated entities that many States have given the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d label.  Under Maryland law, the real estate investment trust at issue is treated as a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate legal entity\xe2\x80\x9d that can sue or be sued.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93102(2), 8\xe2\x80\x93301(2).  Despite what such an entity calls itself, so long as it is unincorporated, this Court will apply the \xe2\x80\x9coft-repeated rule\xe2\x80\x9d that it possesses the citizenship of all its members.

This rule is easy enough to apply to humans, but can become metaphysical when applied to legal entities.  This case asks how to determine the citizenship of a \xe2\x80\x9creal estate investment trust,\xe2\x80\x9d an inanimate creature of Maryland law.  We answer: While humans and corporations can assert their own citizenship, other entities take the citizenship of their members.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This action began as a typical state-law controversy, one involving a contract dispute and an underground food-storage warehouse fire.  A group of corporations whose food perished in that 1991 fire continues to seek compensation from the warehouse\xe2\x80\x99s owner, now known as Americold Realty Trust.  After the corporations filed their latest suit in Kansas court, Americold removed the suit to the Federal District Court for the District of Kansas.  The District Court accepted jurisdiction and resolved the dispute in favor of Americold.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On appeal, however, the Tenth Circuit asked for supplemental briefing on whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate.  The parties responded that the District Court possessed jurisdiction because the suit involved \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of different States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71332(a)(1), 1441(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Tenth Circuit disagreed.  The court considered the corporate plaintiffs citizens of the States where they were chartered and had their principal places of business: Delaware, Nebraska, and Illinois.  See <i>ConAgra Foods, Inc.</i> v. <i>Americold Logistics, LLC,</i> 776 F.\xc2\xa03d 1175, 1182 (2015); \xc2\xa71332(c)(1) (specifying the citizenship of corporations for jurisdictional purposes).  The court applied a different test to determine Americold\xe2\x80\x99s citizenship because Americold is a \xe2\x80\x9creal estate investment trust,\xe2\x80\x9d not a corporation.  Distilling this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, the Tenth Circuit reasoned that the citizenship of any \xe2\x80\x9cnon-corporate artificial entity\xe2\x80\x9d is determined by considering all of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmembers,\xe2\x80\x9d which include, at minimum, its shareholders.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1180\xe2\x80\x931181 (citing <i>Carden</i> v. <i>Arkoma</i> <i>Associates</i>,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185 (1990)\n).  As there was no record of the citizenship of Americold\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders, the court concluded that the parties failed to demonstrate that the plaintiffs were \xe2\x80\x9ccitizens of different States\xe2\x80\x9d than the defendants.  See <i>Strawbridge</i> v. <i>Curtiss</i>, 3 Cranch 267 (1806).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve confusion among the Courts of Appeals regarding the citizenship of unincorporated entities.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  We now affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Exercising its powers under Article III, the First Congress granted federal courts jurisdiction over controversies between a \xe2\x80\x9ccitizen\xe2\x80\x9d of one State and \xe2\x80\x9ca citizen of another State.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n1Stat.\n78.  For a long time, however, Congress failed to explain how to determine the citizenship of a nonbreathing entity like a business association.  In the early 19th century, this Court took that silence literally, ruling that only a human could be a citizen for jurisdictional purposes.  <i>Bank of United States</i> v. <i>Deveaux</i>, 5 Cranch 61, 86\xe2\x80\x9391 (1809).  If a \xe2\x80\x9cmere legal entity\xe2\x80\x9d like a corporation were sued, the relevant citizens were its \xe2\x80\x9cmembers,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9creal persons who come into court\xe2\x80\x9d in the entity\xe2\x80\x99s name.  <i>Id.,</i> at 86, 91.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court later carved a limited exception for corporations, holding that a corporation itself could be considered a citizen of its State of incorporation.  See <i>Louisville, C. &amp; C. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Letson</i>, 2 How. 497, 558 (1844).  Congress etched this exception into the U.\xc2\xa0S. Code, adding that a corporation should also be considered a citizen of the State where it has its principal place of business.\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c) (1958 ed.).  But Congress never expanded this grant of citizenship to include artificial entities other than corporations, such as joint-stock companies or limited partnerships.  For these unincorporated entities, we too have \xe2\x80\x9cadhere[d] to our oft-repeated rule that diversity jurisdiction in a suit by or against the entity depends on the citizenship of \xe2\x80\x98all [its] members.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 195\xe2\x80\x93196 (quoting <i>Chapman</i> v. <i>Barney</i>,\n\n129 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677,\n682 (1889)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite our oft-repetition of the rule linking unincorporated entities with their \xe2\x80\x9cmembers,\xe2\x80\x9d we have never expressly defined the term.  But we have equated an association\xe2\x80\x99s members with its owners or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the several persons composing such association.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 196 (quoting <i>Great Southern Fire Proof Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n177 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449,\n456 (1900)\n).  Applying this principle with reference to specific States\xe2\x80\x99 laws, we have identified the members of a joint-stock company as its shareholders, the members of a partnership as its partners, the members of a union as the workers affiliated with it, and so on.  See <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 189\xe2\x80\x93190 (citing <i>Chapman</i>, 129 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 682; <i>Great Southern</i>, 177 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 457; and <i>Steelworkers</i> v. <i>R. H. Bouligny, Inc.</i>,\n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 145,\n146 (1965)\n).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This case asks us to determine the citizenship of Americold Realty Trust, a \xe2\x80\x9creal estate investment trust\xe2\x80\x9d organized under Maryland law.  App. 93.  As Americold is not a corporation, it possesses its members\xe2\x80\x99 citizenship.  Nothing in the record designates who Americold\xe2\x80\x99s members are.  But Maryland law provides an answer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In Maryland, a real estate investment trust is an \xe2\x80\x9cunincorporated business trust or association\xe2\x80\x9d in which prop-erty is held and managed \xe2\x80\x9cfor the benefit and profit of any person who may become a shareholder.\xe2\x80\x9d  Md. Corp. &amp; Assns. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93101(c), 8\xe2\x80\x93102 (2014).  As with joint-stock companies or partnerships, shareholders have \xe2\x80\x9cownership interests\xe2\x80\x9d and votes in the trust by virtue of their \xe2\x80\x9cshares of beneficial interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93704(b)(5), 8\xe2\x80\x93101(d).  These shareholders appear to be in the same position as the shareholders of a joint-stock company<i> </i>or the partners of a limited partnership\xe2\x80\x94both of whom we viewed as members of their relevant entities.  See <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192\xe2\x80\x93196; see also<i> </i>\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93705(a) (linking the term \xe2\x80\x9cbeneficial interests\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cmembership interests\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpartnership interests\xe2\x80\x9d).  We therefore conclude that for purposes of diversity jurisdiction, Americold\xe2\x80\x99s members include its shareholders.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Americold disputes this conclusion.  It cites a case called <i>Navarro Savings Assn.</i> v. <i>Lee</i>,\n\n446 U.\xc2\xa0S. 458 (1980)\n, to argue that anything called a \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d possesses the citizenship of its trustees alone, not its shareholder beneficiaries as well.  As we have reminded litigants before, however, \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Navarro </i>had nothing to do with the citizenship of [a] \xe2\x80\x98trust.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 192\xe2\x80\x93193.  Rather, <i>Navarro</i> reaffirmed a separate rule that when a trustee files a lawsuit in <i>her </i>name, her jurisdictional citizenship is the State to which she belongs\xe2\x80\x94as is true of any natural person.  446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 465.  This rule coexists with our discussion above that when an artificial entity is sued in <i>its</i> name, it takes the citizenship of each of its members.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That said, Americold\xe2\x80\x99s confusion regarding the citizenship of a trust is understandable and widely shared.  See <i>Emerald Investors Trust </i>v. <i>Gaunt Parsippany Partners</i>, 492 F.\xc2\xa03d 192, 201\xe2\x80\x93206 (CA3 2007) (discussing various approaches among the Circuits).  The confusion can be explained, perhaps, by tradition.  Traditionally, a trust was not considered a distinct legal entity, but a \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between multiple people.  <i>Klein </i>v. <i>Bryer</i>, 227 Md. 473, 476\xe2\x80\x93477, 177 A.\xc2\xa02d 412, 413 (1962); Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa72 (1957).  Such a relationship was not a thing that could be haled into court; legal proceedings involving a trust were brought by or against the trustees in their own name.  <i>Glenn </i>v. <i>Allison</i>, 58 Md. 527, 529 (1882); <i>Deveaux</i>, 5 Cranch, at 91.  And when a trustee files a lawsuit or is sued in her own name, her citizenship is all that matters for diversity purposes.  <i>Navarro</i>, 446 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93466.  For a traditional trust, therefore, there is no need to determine its membership, as would be true if the trust, as an entity, were sued.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many States, however, have applied the \xe2\x80\x9ctrust\xe2\x80\x9d label to a variety of unincorporated entities that have little in common with this traditional template.  Maryland, for example, treats a real estate investment trust as a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate legal entity\xe2\x80\x9d that itself can sue or be sued.  Md. Corp. &amp; Assns. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93102(2), 8\xe2\x80\x93301(2).  So long as such an entity is unincorporated, we apply our \xe2\x80\x9coft-repeated rule\xe2\x80\x9d that it possesses the citizenship of all its members.  <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 195.  But neither this rule nor <i>Navarro </i>limits an entity\xe2\x80\x99s membership to its trustees just because the entity happens to call itself a trust.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore decline to apply the same rule to an unincorporated entity sued in its organizational name that applies to a human trustee sued in her personal name.  We also decline an <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to apply the same rule to an unincorporated entity that applies to a corporation\xe2\x80\x94namely, to consider it a citizen only of its State of establishment and its principal place of business.  See Brief for National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts 11\xe2\x80\x9321.  When we last examined the \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrinal wall\xe2\x80\x9d between corporate and unincorporated entities in 1990, we saw no reason to tear it down.  <i>Carden</i>, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 190.  Then as now we reaffirm that it is up to Congress if it wishes to incorporate other entities into\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)\xe2\x80\x99s special jurisdictional rule.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">Affirmed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
