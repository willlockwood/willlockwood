See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1229b(a)(3), (b)(1)(C).  An aggravated felony includes \xe2\x80\x9ca crime of violence (as defined in [\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716] . . . ) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(f).  Section 16\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a crime of violence is divided into two clauses\xe2\x80\x94often referred to as the elements clause, \xc2\xa716(a), and the residual clause, \xc2\xa716(b).  The residual clause, the provision at issue here, defines a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  To decide whether a person\xe2\x80\x99s conviction falls within the scope of that clause, courts apply the categorical approach.

After his second offense, the Government sought to deport him as an aggravated felon.  An Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals held that California first-degree burglary is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa716(b).  While Dimaya\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending in the Ninth Circuit, this Court held that a similar residual clause in the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA)\xe2\x80\x94defining \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as any felony that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x94was unconstitutionally \xe2\x80\x9cvoid for vagueness\xe2\x80\x9d under the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Relying on <i>Johnson</i>, the Ninth Circuit held that \xc2\xa716(b), as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">803 F.\xc2\xa03d 1110, affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court with respect to Parts I, III, IV\xe2\x80\x93B, and V, concluding that \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is unconstitutionally vague.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9311, 16\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0A straightforward application of <i>Johnson</i> effectively resolves this case.  Section 16(b) has the same two features as ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause\xe2\x80\x94an ordinary-case requirement and an ill-defined risk threshold\xe2\x80\x94combined in the same constitutionally problematic way.  To begin, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause created \xe2\x80\x9cgrave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9ctie[d] the judicial assessment of risk\xe2\x80\x9d to a speculative hypothesis about the crime\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d but provided no guidance on how to figure out what that ordinary case was.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Compounding that uncertainty, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause layered an imprecise \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard on top of the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  The combination of \xe2\x80\x9cindeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime [and] indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at ___, resulted in \xe2\x80\x9cmore unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at ___.  Section 16(b) suffers from those same two flaws.  Like ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, \xc2\xa716(b) calls for a court to identify a crime\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d in order to measure the crime\xe2\x80\x99s risk but \xe2\x80\x9coffers no reliable way\xe2\x80\x9d to discern what the ordinary version of any offense looks like.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___.  And its \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d threshold is no more determinate than ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  Thus, the same \xe2\x80\x9c[t]wo features\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cconspire[d] to make\xe2\x80\x9d ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause unconstitutionally vague also exist in \xc2\xa716(b), with the same result.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) The Government identifies three textual discrepancies between ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause and \xc2\xa716(b) that it claims make \xc2\xa716(b) easier to apply and thus cure the constitutional infirmity.  None, however, relates to the pair of features that <i>Johnson</i> found to produce impermissible vagueness or otherwise makes the statutory inquiry more determinate.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1) First, the Government argues that \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s express requirement (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise from acts taken \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d serves as a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal restriction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words,<i> </i>a court applying \xc2\xa716(b) may not \xe2\x80\x9cconsider risks arising <i>after</i>\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>the offense\xe2\x80\x99s commission is over.  Brief for Petitioner 31.<i> </i>But this is not a meaningful limitation: In the ordinary case of any offense, the riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during<i> </i>its commission, not events occurring later.  So with or without the temporal language, a court applying the ordinary case approach, whether in \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s or ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, would do the same thing\xe2\x80\x94ask what usually happens when a crime is committed.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d makes no difference as to either outcome or clarity and cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy <i>Johnson </i>described.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Second, the Government says that the \xc2\xa716(b) inquiry, which focuses on the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctrains solely\xe2\x80\x9d on the conduct typically involved in a crime.  Brief for Petitioner 36.  In contrast, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause asked about the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a second inquiry into a speculative \xe2\x80\x9cchain of causation that could possibly result in a victim\xe2\x80\x99s injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  However, this Court has made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States, </i>\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133, 140\n.  So under \xc2\xa716(b) too, a court must not only identify the conduct typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its potential consequences.  Thus, the force/injury distinction does not clarify a court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of whether a crime qualifies as violent.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Third, the Government notes that \xc2\xa716(b) avoids the vagueness of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause because it is not preceded by a \xe2\x80\x9cconfusing list of exemplar crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 38.  Those enumerated crimes were in fact too varied to assist this Court in giving ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause meaning.  But to say that they failed to resolve the clause\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2) The Government also relies on judicial experience with \xc2\xa716(b), arguing that because it has divided lower courts less often and resulted in only one certiorari grant, it must be clearer than its ACCA counterpart.  But in fact, a host of issues respecting \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s application to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts.  And while this Court has only heard oral arguments in two \xc2\xa716(b) cases, this Court vacated the judgments in a number of other \xc2\xa716(b) cases, remanding them for further consideration in light of ACCA decisions.  Pp. 21\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Kagan, joined by Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor, concluded in Parts II and IV\xe2\x80\x93A:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Government argues that a more permissive form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies than the one <i>Johnson</i> employed because the removal of an alien is a civil matter rather than a criminal case.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent forecloses that argument.  In <i>Jordan</i> v. <i>De George</i>,\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223\n, the Court considered what vagueness standard applied in removal cases and concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9cin view of the grave nature of deportation,\xe2\x80\x9d the most exacting vagueness standard must apply.  <i>Id.,</i> at 231.  Nothing in the ensuing years calls that reasoning into question.  This Court has reiterated that deportation is \xe2\x80\x9ca particularly severe penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d which may be of greater concern to a convicted alien than \xe2\x80\x9cany potential jail sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jae Lee</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Section 16(b) demands a categorical, ordinary-case approach.  For reasons expressed in <i>Johnson</i>, that approach cannot be abandoned in favor of a conduct-based approach, which asks about the specific way in which a defendant committed a crime. To begin, the Government once again \xe2\x80\x9chas not asked [the Court] to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases,\xe2\x80\x9d suggesting the fact-based approach is an untenable interpretation of \xc2\xa716(b).  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Moreover, a fact-based approach would generate constitutional questions.  In any event, \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text demands a categorical approach.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have consistently understood language in the residual clauses of both ACCA and \xc2\xa716 to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States,</i>\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, 601\n.  And the words \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa716(b) even more clearly compel an inquiry into an offense\xe2\x80\x99s normal and characteristic quality\xe2\x80\x94that is, what the offense ordinarily entails.  Finally, given the daunting difficulties of accurately \xe2\x80\x9creconstruct[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d often many years later, \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct underlying [a] conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d the conduct-based approach\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cutter impracticability\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and associated inequities\xe2\x80\x94is as great in \xc2\xa716(b) as in ACCA.  <i>Johnson, </i>576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Justice Gorsuch, agreeing that the Immigration and Nationality Act provision at hand is unconstitutionally vague for the reasons identified in <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, concluded that the void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as a faithful expression of ancient due process and separation of powers principles the Framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under the Constitution.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a less-than-fair-notice standard should apply where (as here) a person faces only civil, not criminal, consequences from a statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation is unavailing.  In the criminal context, the law generally must afford \xe2\x80\x9cordinary people . . . fair notice of the conduct it punishes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at ___, and it is hard to see how the Due Process Clause might often require any less than that in the civil context.  Nor is there any good reason to single out civil deportation for assessment under the fair notice standard because of the special gravity of its penalty when so many civil laws impose so many similarly severe sanctions.  Alternative approaches that do not concede the propriety of the categorical ordinary case analysis are more properly addressed in another case, involving either the Immigration and Nationality Act or another statute, where the parties have a chance to be heard.

The question in this case is whether a similarly worded clause in a statute\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d suffers from the same constitutional defect.

ACCA prescribes a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence if a person convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm has three prior convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  The definition of that statutory term goes as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(i)\xe2\x80\x82has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(ii)\xe2\x80\x82is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <i>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The italicized portion of that definition (like the similar language of \xc2\xa716(b)) came to be known as the statute\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  In <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>United States</i>, the Court declared that clause \xe2\x80\x9cvoid for vagueness\xe2\x80\x9d under the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Relying on <i>Johnson</i>, the Ninth Circuit held that \xc2\xa716(b), as incorporated into the INA, was also unconstitutionally vague, and accordingly ruled in Dimaya\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  See <i>Dimaya</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 1110, 1120 (2015).  Two other Circuits reached the same conclusion, but a third distinguished ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause from \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  <i>Lynch</i> v. <i>Dimaya</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cThe prohibition of vagueness in criminal statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d our decision in <i>Johnson </i>explained, is an \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d of due process, required by both \xe2\x80\x9cordinary notions of fair play and the settled rules of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 4) (quoting <i>Connally</i> v. <i>General Constr. Co.</i>,\n\n269 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, 391 (1926)\n).  The void-for-vagueness doctrine, as we have called it, guarantees that ordinary people have \xe2\x80\x9cfair notice\xe2\x80\x9d of the conduct a statute proscribes.  <i>Papachristou</i> v. <i>Jacksonville</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156, 162 (1972)\n.  And the doctrine guards against arbitrary or discriminatory law enforcement by insisting that a statute provide standards to govern the actions of police officers, prosecutors, juries, and judges.  See <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352, 357\n\xe2\x80\x93358 (1983).  In that sense, the doctrine is a corollary of the separation of powers\xe2\x80\x94requiring that Congress, rather than the executive or judicial branch, define what conduct is sanctionable and what is not.  Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 358, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, [it would] substitute the judicial for the legislative department\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government argues that a less searching form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine applies here than in <i>Johnson </i>because this is not a criminal case.  See Brief for Petitioner 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  As the Government notes, this Court has stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he degree of vagueness that the Constitution [allows] depends in part on the nature of the enactment\xe2\x80\x9d: In particular, the Court has \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hoffman Estates</i> v. <i>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 489, 498\n\xe2\x80\x93499 (1982).  The removal of an alien is a civil matter.  See <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n567 U.\xc2\xa0S. 387, 396 (2012)\n.  Hence, the Govern- ment claims, the need for clarity is not so strong; even a law too vague to support a conviction or sentence may be good enough to sustain a deportation order.  See Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent forecloses that argument, because we long ago held that the most exacting vagueness standard should apply in removal cases.  In <i>Jordan </i>v. <i>De George</i>,<i> </i>we considered whether a provision of immigration law making an alien deportable if convicted of a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently definite.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, 229 (1951)\n.  That provision, we noted, \xe2\x80\x9cis not a criminal statute\xe2\x80\x9d (as \xc2\xa716(b) actually is).  <i>Id.,</i> at 231; <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Still, we chose to test (and ultimately uphold) it \xe2\x80\x9cunder the established criteria of the \xe2\x80\x98void for vagueness\xe2\x80\x99 doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to criminal laws.  341 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 231.<i> </i>That approach was demanded, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cin view of the grave nature of deportation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic measure,\xe2\x80\x9d often amounting to lifelong \xe2\x80\x9cbanishment or exile,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Fong Haw Tan</i> v. <i>Phelan</i>,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6, 10 (1948)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in the ensuing years calls that reasoning into question.  To the contrary, this Court has reiterated that deportation is \xe2\x80\x9ca particularly severe penalty,\xe2\x80\x9d which may be of greater concern to a convicted alien than \xe2\x80\x9cany potential jail sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jae Lee </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 11) (quoting <i>Padilla</i> v. <i>Kentucky</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356, 365, 368 (2010)\n).  And we have observed that as federal immigration law increasingly hinged deportation orders on prior convictions, removal proceedings became ever more \xe2\x80\x9cintimately related to the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Chaidez</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n568 U.\xc2\xa0S. 342, 352 (2013)\n (quoting <i>Padilla</i>, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 365). <i> </i>What follows, as <i>Jordan </i>recognized, is the use of the same standard in the two settings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For that reason, the Government cannot take refuge in a more permissive form of the void-for-vagueness doctrine than the one <i>Johnson </i>employed.  To salvage \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, even for use in immigration hearings, the Gov- ernment must instead persuade us that it is materially clearer than its now-invalidated ACCA counterpart.   That is the issue we next address, as guided by <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"><i>Johnson </i>is a straightforward decision, with equally straightforward application here.  Its principal section begins as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cTwo features of [ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s] residual clause conspire to make it unconstitutionally vague.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  The opinion then identifies each of those features and explains how their joinder produced \xe2\x80\x9chopeless indeterminacy,\xe2\x80\x9d inconsistent with due process.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 7).  And with that reasoning, <i>Johnson </i>effectively resolved the case now before us.  For \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause has the same two features as ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s, combined in the same constitutionally problem- atic way.  Consider those two, just as <i>Johnson </i>described them:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cIn the first place,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson </i>explained, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause created \xe2\x80\x9cgrave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9ctie[d] the judicial assessment of risk\xe2\x80\x9d to a hypothesis about the crime\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 5).  Under the clause, a court focused on neither the \xe2\x80\x9creal-world facts\xe2\x80\x9d nor the bare \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory elements\xe2\x80\x9d of an offense.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Instead, a court was supposed to \xe2\x80\x9cimagine\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9cidealized ordinary case of the crime\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or otherwise put, the court had to identify the \xe2\x80\x9ckind of conduct the \xe2\x80\x98ordinary case\xe2\x80\x99 of a crime involves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>But how, <i>Johnson </i>asked, should a court figure that out?  By using a \xe2\x80\x9cstatistical analysis of the state reporter?  A survey?  Expert evidence?  Google?  Gut instinct?\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).  ACCA provided no guidance, rendering judicial accounts of the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d wholly \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  Johnson </i>gave as its prime example the crime of attempted bur- glary.  One judge, contemplating the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case,\xe2\x80\x9d would imagine the \xe2\x80\x9cviolent encounter\xe2\x80\x9d apt to ensue when a \xe2\x80\x9cwould-be burglar [was] spotted by a police officer [or] private security guard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).  Another judge would conclude that \xe2\x80\x9cany confrontation\xe2\x80\x9d was more \xe2\x80\x9clikely to consist of [an observer\xe2\x80\x99s] yelling \xe2\x80\x98Who\xe2\x80\x99s there?\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the burglar\xe2\x80\x99s running away.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).  But how could either judge really know?  \xe2\x80\x9cThe residual clause,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Johnson </i>summarized, \xe2\x80\x9coffer[ed] no reliable way\xe2\x80\x9d to discern what the ordinary version of any offense looked like.  <i>Ibid.</i>  And without that, no one could tell how much risk the offense generally posed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Compounding that first uncertainty, <i>Johnson </i>continued, was a second: ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause left unclear what threshold level of risk made any given crime a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ibid.</i>  The Court emphasized that this feature alone would not have violated the void-for-vagueness doctrine: Many perfectly constitutional statutes use imprecise terms like \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d (as in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause) or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d (as in \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s).  The problem came from layering such a standard on top of the requisite \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  As the Court explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99 to real-world conduct; the law is full of instances where a man\xe2\x80\x99s fate depends on his estimating rightly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. some matter of degree[.]  The residual clause, however, requires application of the \xe2\x80\x98serious potential risk\xe2\x80\x99 standard to an idealized ordinary case of the crime.  Because the elements necessary to determine the imaginary ideal are uncertain[,] this abstract inquiry offers significantly less predictability than one that deals with the actual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 12) (some internal quotation marks, citations, and alterations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So much less predictability, in fact, that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause could not pass constitutional muster.  As the Court again put the point, in the punch line of its decision: \xe2\x80\x9cBy combining indeterminacy about how to measure the risk posed by a crime with indeterminacy about how much risk it takes for the crime to qualify as a violent felony, the residual clause\xe2\x80\x9d violates the guarantee of due process.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 16\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause violates that promise in just the same way.  To begin where <i>Johnson </i>did, \xc2\xa716(b) also calls for a court to identify a crime\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d in order to measure the crime\xe2\x80\x99s risk.  The Government explicitly acknowledges that point here.  See Brief for Petitioner 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 16(b), like [ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s] residual clause, requires a court to assess the risk posed by the ordinary case of a particular offense\xe2\x80\x9d).  And indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s briefing in <i>Johnson </i>warned us about that likeness, observing that \xc2\xa716(b) would be \xe2\x80\x9cequally susceptible to [an] objection\xe2\x80\x9d that focused on the problems of positing a crime\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary case.  Supp. Brief for Respondent, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2014, No. 13\xe2\x80\x937120, pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9323.  Nothing in \xc2\xa716(b) helps courts to perform that task, just as nothing in ACCA did.  We can as well repeat here what we asked in <i>Johnson</i>: How does one go about divining the conduct entailed in a crime\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary case?  Statistical analyses?  Surveys?  Experts?  Google?  Gut instinct?  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5); <i>supra,</i> at 7; <i>post, </i>at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And we can as well reiterate <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s example: In the ordinary case of attempted burglary, is the would-be culprit spotted and confronted, or scared off by a yell?  See <i>post,</i> at 16 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.) (offering other knotty examples).  Once again, the questions have no good answers; the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d remains, as <i>Johnson </i>described it, an excessively \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative,\xe2\x80\x9d essentially inscrutable thing. 576 U.\xc2\xa0S.,  at ___ (slip op., at 5); accord <i>post</i>, at 27 (Thomas, J.,  dissenting).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And \xc2\xa716(b) also possesses the second fatal feature of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause: uncertainty about the level of risk that makes a crime \xe2\x80\x9cviolent.\xe2\x80\x9d  In ACCA, that threshold was \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d; in \xc2\xa716(b), it is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 2, 4.  But the Government does not argue that the latter formulation is any more determinate than the former, and for good reason.  As The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s valiant attempt to do so shows, that would be slicing the baloney mighty thin.  See <i>post, </i>at 5\xe2\x80\x936 (dissenting opinion).  And indeed, <i>Johnson </i>as much as equated the two phrases: Return to the block quote above, and note how <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x94as though anticipating this case\xe2\x80\x94refers to them interchangeably, as alike examples of imprecise \xe2\x80\x9cqualitative standard[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 8; 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Once again, the point is not that such a non-numeric standard is alone problematic: In <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s words,<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cwe do not doubt\xe2\x80\x9d the constitutionality of applying \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk [standard] to real-world conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 12) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The difficulty comes, in \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause just as in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s, from applying such a standard to \xe2\x80\x9ca judge-imagined abstraction\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., \xe2\x80\x9c</i>an idealized ordinary case of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 12).  It is then that the standard ceases to work in a way consistent with due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, \xc2\xa716(b) has the same \xe2\x80\x9c[t]wo features\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cconspire[d] to make [ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause] unconstitutionally vague.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 5).  It too \xe2\x80\x9crequires a court to picture the kind of conduct that the crime involves in \xe2\x80\x98the ordinary case,\xe2\x80\x99 and to judge whether that abstraction presents\xe2\x80\x9d some not-well-specified-yet-sufficiently-large degree of risk.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 4).  The result is that \xc2\xa716(b) produces, just as ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause did, \xe2\x80\x9cmore unpredictability and arbitrariness than the Due Process Clause tolerates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government and dissents offer two fundamentally different accounts of how \xc2\xa716(b) can escape unscathed from our decision in <i>Johnson</i>.  Justice Thomas accepts that the ordinary-case inquiry makes \xc2\xa716(b) \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible to apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 27.  His solution is to overthrow our historic understanding of the statute: We should now read \xc2\xa716(b), he says, to ask about the risk posed by a particular defendant\xe2\x80\x99s particular conduct.  In contrast, the Government, joined by The Chief Justice, accepts that \xc2\xa716(b), as long interpreted, demands a categorical approach, rather than a case-specific one.  They argue only that \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive textual features\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause make applying it \xe2\x80\x9cmore predictable\xe2\x80\x9d than its ACCA counter- part.  Brief for Petitioner 28, 29.  We disagree with both arguments.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The essentials of Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s position go as follows.  Section 16(b), he says, cannot have one meaning, but could have one of two others.  See <i>post, </i>at 27.  The provision cannot demand an inquiry merely into the elements of a crime, because that is the province of \xc2\xa716(a).  See <i>supra,</i> at 2 (setting out \xc2\xa716(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text).  But that still leaves a pair of options: the categorical, ordinary-case approach and the \xe2\x80\x9cunderlying-conduct approach,\xe2\x80\x9d which asks about the specific way in which a defendant committed a crime.  <i>Post,</i> at 25.  According to Justice Thomas, each option is textually viable (although he gives a slight nod to the latter based on \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d).  See <i>post,</i> at 24\xe2\x80\x9326.  What tips the scales is that only one\xe2\x80\x94the conduct approach\xe2\x80\x94is at all \xe2\x80\x9cworkable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post,</i> at 27.  The difficulties of the ordinary-case inquiry, Justice Thomas rightly observes, underlie this Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa716(b) is too vague.  So abandon that inquiry, Justice Thomas urges.  After all, he reasons, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplain duty,\xe2\x80\x9d under the constitutional avoidance canon, to adopt any reasonable construction of a statute that escapes constitutional problems.  <i>Post,</i> at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (quoting <i>United States ex rel.

The dissent there issued the same invitation, based on much the same reasoning, to jettison the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9313) (opinion of Alito, J.).  The Court declined to do so.  It first noted that the Government had not asked us to switch to a fact-based inquiry.  It then observed that the Court \xe2\x80\x9chad good reasons\xe2\x80\x9d for originally adopting the categorical approach, based partly on ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s text (which, by the way, uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d identi- cally) and partly on the \xe2\x80\x9cutter impracticability\xe2\x80\x9d of the alter- native.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 13) (majority opinion).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe only plausible interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, we concluded, \xe2\x80\x9crequires use of the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if that approach could not in the end satisfy constitutional standards.  <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same is true here\xe2\x80\x94except more so.  To begin where <i>Johnson </i>did, the Government once again \xe2\x80\x9chas not asked us to abandon the categorical approach in residual-clause cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>To the contrary, and as already noted, the Government has conceded at every step the correctness of that statutory construction.  See <i>supra,</i> at 9.  And this time, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision is even more noteworthy than before\xe2\x80\x94precisely because the <i>Johnson </i>dissent laid out the opposite view, presenting it in prepackaged form for the Government to take off the shelf and use in the \xc2\xa716(b) context.  Of course, we are not foreclosed from going down Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s path just because the Government has not done so.  But we find it significant that the Government cannot bring itself to say that the fact-based approach Justice Thomas proposes is a tenable interpretation of \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps one reason for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reluctance is that such an approach would generate its own constitutional questions.  As Justice Thomas relates, <i>post, </i>at 22, 28, this Court adopted the categorical approach in part to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[\xc2\xa0] the\n \nSixth Amendment concerns that would arise from sentencing courts\xe2\x80\x99 making findings of fact that properly belong to juries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Descamps</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254, 267 (2013)\n.  Justice Thomas thinks that issue need not detain us here because \xe2\x80\x9cthe right of trial by jury ha[s] no application in a removal proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But although this particular case involves removal, \xc2\xa716(b) is a criminal statute, with criminal sentencing consequences.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And this Court has held (it could hardly have done otherwise) that \xe2\x80\x9cwe must interpret the statute con- sistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 12, n.\xc2\xa08.  So Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion would merely ping-pong us from one constitutional issue to another.  And that means the avoidance canon cannot serve, as he would like, as the interpretive tie breaker.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text creates no draw: Best read, it demands a categorical approach.  Our decisions have consistently understood language in the residual clauses of both ACCA and \xc2\xa716 to refer to \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute of conviction, not to the facts of each defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, 601 (1990)\n; see <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 7 (Section 16 \xe2\x80\x9cdirects our focus to the \xe2\x80\x98offense\xe2\x80\x99 of conviction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rather than to the particular facts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Simple references to a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfelony,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9coffense,\xe2\x80\x9d we have stated, are \xe2\x80\x9cread naturally\xe2\x80\x9d to denote the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime as <i>generally </i>committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29, 34 (2009)\n; see <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 7; <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  And the words \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa716(b) make that meaning all the clearer.  The statute, recall, directs courts to consider whether an offense, <i>by its nature</i>, poses the requisite risk of force.  An offense\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d means its \xe2\x80\x9cnormal and characteristic quality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1507 (2002).  So \xc2\xa716(b) tells courts to figure out what an offense normally\xe2\x80\x94or, as we have repeatedly said, \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94entails, not what happened to occur on one occasion.  And the same conclusion follows if we pay attention to language that is <i>missing</i> from \xc2\xa716(b).  As we have observed in the ACCA context, the absence of terms alluding to a crime\xe2\x80\x99s circumstances, or its commission, makes a fact-based interpretation an uncomfortable fit.  See <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267.  If Congress had wanted judges to look into a felon\xe2\x80\x99s actual conduct, \xe2\x80\x9cit presumably would have said so; other statutes, in other contexts, speak in just that way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 267\xe2\x80\x93268.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  The upshot of all this textual evidence is that \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause\xe2\x80\x94like ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s, except still more plainly\xe2\x80\x94has no \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d fact-based reading.  <i>Johnson, </i>576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And finally, the \xe2\x80\x9cutter impracticability\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and associated inequities\xe2\x80\x94of such an interpretation is as great in the one statute as in the other.  <i>Ibid.</i>  This Court has often described the daunting difficulties of accurately \xe2\x80\x9creconstruct[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d often many years later, \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct underlying [a] conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>Descamps</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 270; <i>Taylor</i>, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 601\xe2\x80\x93602.  According to Justice Thomas, we need not worry here because immigration judges have some special factfinding talent, or at least experience, that would mitigate the risk of error attaching to that endeavor in federal courts.  See <i>post, </i>at 30.  But we cannot see putting so much weight on the superior factfinding prowess of (notoriously overburdened) immigration judges.  And as we have said before, \xc2\xa716(b) is a criminal statute with applications outside the immigration context.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2, 13.  Once again, then, we have no ground for discovering a novel interpretation of \xc2\xa716(b) that would remove us from the dictates of <i>Johnson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Agreeing that is so, the Government (joined by The Chief Justice) takes a narrower path to the same desired result.  It points to three textual discrepancies between ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause and \xc2\xa716(b), and argues that they make \xc2\xa716(b) significantly easier to apply.  But each turns out to be the proverbial distinction without a difference.  None relates to the pair of features\xe2\x80\x94the ordinary-case inquiry and a hazy risk threshold\xe2\x80\x94that <i>Johnson </i>found to produce impermissible vagueness.  And none otherwise affects the determinacy of the statutory inquiry into whether a prior conviction is for a violent crime.  That is why, contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s final argument, the experience of applying <i>both</i> statutes has generated confusion and division among lower courts.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Government first\xe2\x80\x94and foremost\xe2\x80\x94relies on \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s express requirement (absent from ACCA) that the risk arise from acts taken \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 31.  (The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent echoes much of this argument.  See <i>post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x937.)  Because of that \xe2\x80\x9ctemporal restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d a court applying \xc2\xa716(b) may not \xe2\x80\x9cconsider risks arising <i>after</i>\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>the offense\xe2\x80\x99s commission is over.  <i>Ibid.  </i>In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text thereby demands a \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly more focused inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d than did ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  <i>Id.,</i> at 32.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To assess that claim, start with the meaning of \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d language.  That phrase, understood in the normal way, includes the conduct occurring throughout a crime\xe2\x80\x99s commission\xe2\x80\x94not just the conduct sufficient to satisfy the offense\xe2\x80\x99s formal elements.  The Government agrees with that construction, explaining that the words \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d sweep in everything that happens while a crime continues.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (Oct. 2, 2017) (illustrating that idea with reference to conspiracy, burglary, kidnapping, and escape from prison).  So, for example, conspiracy may be a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(b) because of the risk of force while the conspiracy is ongoing (<i>i.e., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d the conspiracy); it is irrelevant that conspiracy\xe2\x80\x99s elements are met as soon as the participants have made an agreement.  See <i>ibid.</i>; <i>United States </i>v. <i>Doe</i>, 49 F.\xc2\xa03d 859, 866 (CA2 1995).  Similarly, and closer to home, burglary may be a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(b) because of the prospects of an encounter while the burglar remains in a building (<i>i.e., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d the burglary); it does not matter that the elements of the crime are met at the precise moment of his entry.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 57\xe2\x80\x9358 (Oct. 2, 2017); <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203.  In other words, a court applying \xc2\xa716(b) gets to consider everything that is likely to take place for as long as a crime is being committed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because that is so, \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d language does little to narrow or focus the statutory inquiry.  All that the phrase excludes is a court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to consider the risk that force will be used after the crime has entirely concluded\xe2\x80\x94so, for example, after the conspiracy has dissolved or the burglar has left the building.  We can construct law-school-type hypotheticals fitting that fact pattern\xe2\x80\x94say, a burglar who constructs a booby trap that later knocks out the homeowner.  But such imaginative forays cannot realistically affect a court\xe2\x80\x99s view of the <i>ordinary case </i>of a crime, which is all that matters under the statute.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933, 7.  In the ordinary case, the riskiness of a crime arises from events occurring during its commission, not events occurring later.  So with or without \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s explicit temporal language, a court applying the section would do the same thing\xe2\x80\x94ask what usually happens when a crime goes down.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And that is just what courts did when applying ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause\xe2\x80\x94and for the same reason.  True, that clause lacked an express temporal limit.  But not a single one of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s ACCA decisions turned on conduct that might occur after a crime\xe2\x80\x99s commission; instead, each hinged on the risk arising from events that could happen while the crime was ongoing.  See, <i>e.g., Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 10 (2011)\n (assessing the risks attached to the \xe2\x80\x9cconfrontations that initiate and terminate\xe2\x80\x9d vehicle flight, along with \xe2\x80\x9cintervening\xe2\x80\x9d events); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122, 128 (2009)\n (rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that violent incidents \xe2\x80\x9coccur[ring] long after\xe2\x80\x9d a person unlawfully failed to report to prison rendered that crime a violent felony).  Nor could those decisions have done otherwise, given the statute\xe2\x80\x99s concern with the ordinary (rather than the outlandish) case.  Once again, the riskiness of a crime in the ordinary case depends on the acts taken during\xe2\x80\x94not after\xe2\x80\x94its commission.  Thus, the analyses under ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause and \xc2\xa716(b) coincide.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xe2\x80\x9d makes no difference as to either outcome or clarity.  Every offense that could have fallen within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause might equally fall within \xc2\xa716(b).  And the difficulty of deciding whether it does so remains just as intractable.  Indeed, we cannot think of a single federal crime whose treatment becomes more obvious under \xc2\xa716(b) than under ACCA because of the words \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  The phrase, then, cannot cure the statutory indeterminacy <i>Johnson </i>described.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Government (and again, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, see <i>post, </i>at 6) observes that \xc2\xa716(b) focuses on the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d whereas ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause asked about the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xc2\xa716(b) inquiry, the Government says, \xe2\x80\x9ctrains solely\xe2\x80\x9d on the conduct typically involved in a crime.  Brief for Petitioner 36.  By contrast, the Government continues, ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause required a second inquiry: After describing the ordinary criminal\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, a court had to \xe2\x80\x9cspeculate about a chain of causation that could possibly result in a victim\xe2\x80\x99s injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The Government\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is that the \xc2\xa716(b) inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cmore specific.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But once more, we struggle to see how that statutory distinction would matter.  To begin with, the first of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s two steps\xe2\x80\x94defining the conduct in the ordinary case\xe2\x80\x94is almost always the difficult part.  Once that is accomplished, the assessment of consequences tends to follow as a matter of course.  So, for example, if a crime is likely enough to lead to a shooting, it will also be likely enough to lead to an injury.  And still more important, \xc2\xa716(b) involves two steps as well\xe2\x80\x94and essentially the same ones.  In interpreting statutes like \xc2\xa716(b), this Court has made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cforce capable of causing physical pain or injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 133, 140 (2010)\n (defining the term for purposes of deciding what counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d crime).  So under \xc2\xa716(b) too, a court must not only identify the conduct typically involved in a crime, but also gauge its potential consequences.  Or said a bit differently, evaluating the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d itself entails considering the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  For those reasons, the force/injury distinction is unlikely to affect a court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of whether a crime qualifies as violent.  All the same crimes might\xe2\x80\x94or, then again, might not\xe2\x80\x94satisfy both requirements.  Accordingly, this variance in wording cannot make ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause vague and \xc2\xa716(b) not.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the Government briefly notes that \xc2\xa716(b), unlike ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, is not preceded by a \xe2\x80\x9cconfusing list of exemplar crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 38.  (The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent reiterates this argument, with some additional references to our caselaw.  See <i>post, </i>at 10\xe2\x80\x9312.)  Here, the Government is referring to the offenses ACCA designated as violent felonies independently of the residual clause (<i>i.e.</i>,<i> </i>burglary, arson, extortion, and use of explosives).  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  According to the Government, those crimes provided \xe2\x80\x9ccontradictory and opaque indications\xe2\x80\x9d of what non-specified offenses should also count as violent.  Brief for Petitioner 38.  Because \xc2\xa716(b) lacks any such enumerated crimes, the Government concludes, it avoids the vagueness of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We readily accept a part of that argument.  This Court for several years looked to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s listed crimes for help in giving the residual clause meaning.  See, <i>e.g., Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137, 142 (2008)\n; <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203.  But to no avail.  As the Government relates (and <i>Johnson </i>explained), the enumerated crimes were themselves too varied to provide such assistance.  See Brief for Petitioner 38\xe2\x80\x9340; 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 12).  Trying to reconcile them with each other, and then compare them to whatever unlisted crime was at issue, drove many a judge a little batty.  And more to the point, the endeavor failed to bring any certainty to the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s application.  See Brief for Petitioner 38\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion does not follow.  To say that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s listed crimes failed to resolve the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness is hardly to say they caused the problem.  Had they done so, <i>Johnson </i>would not have needed to strike down the clause.  It could simply have instructed courts to give up on trying to interpret the clause by reference to the enumerated offenses.  (Contrary to The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <i>post, </i>at 12, discarding an interpretive tool once it is found not to actually aid in interpretation hardly \xe2\x80\x9cexpand[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the scope of a statute.)  That <i>Johnson</i> went so much further\xe2\x80\x94invalidating a statutory provision rather than construing it independently of another\xe2\x80\x94demonstrates that the list of crimes was not the culprit.  And indeed, <i>Johnson </i>explicitly said as much.  As described earlier, <i>Johnson </i>found the residual clause\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness to reside in just \xe2\x80\x9ctwo\xe2\x80\x9d of its features: the  ordinary-case requirement and a fuzzy risk standard.  See 576 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936); <i>supra,</i> at 7\xe2\x80\x938.   Strip away the enumerated crimes\xe2\x80\x94as Congress did in \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x94and those dual flaws yet remain.  And ditto the textual indeterminacy that flows from them.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Faced with the two clauses\xe2\x80\x99 linguistic similarity, the Government relies significantly on an argument rooted in judicial experience.  Our opinion in <i>Johnson</i>, the Government notes, spoke of the longstanding \xe2\x80\x9ctrouble\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court and others had in \xe2\x80\x9cmaking sense of [ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s] residual clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9); see Brief for Petitioner 45.  According to the Government, \xc2\xa716(b) has not produced \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable difficulties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 46.  Lower courts, the Government claims, have divided less often about the provision\xe2\x80\x99s meaning, and as a result this Court granted certiorari on \xe2\x80\x9conly a single Section 16(b) case\xe2\x80\x9d before this one.  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  \xe2\x80\x9cThe most likely explanation,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government concludes, is that \xe2\x80\x9cSection 16(b) is clearer\xe2\x80\x9d than its ACCA counterpart.  <i>Id.,</i> at 47.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> But in fact, a host of issues respecting \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s application to specific crimes divide the federal appellate courts.  Does car burglary qualify as a violent felony under \xc2\xa716(b)?  Some courts say yes, another says no.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  What of statutory rape?  Once again, the Circuits part ways.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  How about evading arrest?  The decisions point in different directions.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]  Residential trespass?  The same is true.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  Those examples do not exhaust the current catalogue of Circuit conflicts concerning \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s application.  See Brief for National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 7\xe2\x80\x9318 (citing divided appellate decisions as to the unauthorized use of a vehicle, firearms possession, and abduction).  And that roster would just expand with time, mainly because, as <i>Johnson </i>explained, precious few crimes (of the thousands that fill the statute books) have an obvious, non-speculative\xe2\x80\x94and therefore undisputed\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cordinary case.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior handling of \xc2\xa716(b) cases support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  To be sure, we have heard oral argument in only two cases arising from \xc2\xa716(b) (including this one), as compared with five involving ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause (including <i>Johnson</i>).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  But while some of those ACCA suits were pending before us, we received a number of petitions for certiorari presenting related issues in the \xc2\xa716(b) context.  And after issuing the relevant ACCA decisions, we vacated the judgments in those \xc2\xa716(b) cases and remanded them for further consideration.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]  That we disposed of the ACCA and \xc2\xa716(b) petitions in that order, rather than its opposite, provides no reason to disregard the indeterminacy that \xc2\xa716(b) shares with ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And of course, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s experience in deciding ACCA cases only supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa716(b) is too vague.  For that record reveals that a statute with all the same hallmarks as \xc2\xa716(b) could not be applied with the predictability the Constitution demands.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x939); <i>supra,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x939.  The Government would condemn us to repeat the past\xe2\x80\x94to rerun the old ACCA tape, as though we remembered nothing from its first showing.

In effect, The Chief Justice is able to conclude that \xc2\xa716(b) can survive <i>Johnson </i>only by refusing to acknowledge one of the two core insights of that decision. </span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0For example, in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Hayes</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415 (2009)\n, this Court held that a firearms statute referring to former crimes as \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted by\xe2\x80\x9d specified persons requires courts to consider underlying facts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 421.  And in <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29 (2009)\n, the Court similarly adopted a non-categorical interpretation of one of the aggravated felonies listed in the INA because of the phrase, appended to the named offense, \xe2\x80\x9cin which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 34, 36 (emphasis deleted).

According to the Government, possession of a short-barreled shotgun could count as violent under ACCA but not under \xc2\xa716(b) because shooting the gun is \xe2\x80\x9cnot in the course of committing the crime of possession.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 59\xe2\x80\x9360 (Oct. 2, 2017); see Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\xe2\x80\x937 (Jan. 17, 2017); Brief for Petitioner 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  That is just wrong: When a criminal shoots a gun, he does so while (\xe2\x80\x9cin the course of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d) possessing it (except perhaps in some physics-defying fantasy world).  What makes the offense difficult to classify as violent is something different: that while some people use the short-barreled shotguns they possess to commit murder, others merely store them in a nearby firearms cabinet\xe2\x80\x94and it is hard to settle which is the more likely scenario.

Before the Revolution, the crime of treason in English law was so capa- ciously construed that the mere expression of disfavored opinions could invite transportation or death.  The founders cited the crown\xe2\x80\x99s abuse of \xe2\x80\x9cpretended\xe2\x80\x9d crimes like this as one of their reasons for revolution.  See Declaration of Independence \xc2\xb621.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s vague laws may not be as invidious, but they can invite the exercise of arbitrary power all the same\xe2\x80\x94by leaving the people in the dark about what the law demands and allowing prosecutors and courts to make it up.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The law before us today is such a law.  Before holding a lawful permanent resident alien like James Dimaya subject to removal for having committed a crime, the Immigration and Nationality Act requires a judge to determine that the ordinary case of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction involves a substantial risk that physical force may be used.  But what does that mean?  Just take the crime at issue in this case, California burglary, which applies to everyone from armed home intruders to door-to-door salesmen peddling shady products.  How, on that vast spectrum, is anyone supposed to locate the ordinary case and say whether it includes a substantial risk of physical force?  The truth is, no one knows.  The law\xe2\x80\x99s silence leaves judges to their intuitions and the people to their fate.  In my judgment, the Constitution demands more.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I begin with a foundational question.  Writing for the Court in <i>Johnson </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), Justice Scalia held the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act void for vagueness because it invited \xe2\x80\x9cmore unpredictability and arbitrariness\xe2\x80\x9d than the Constitution allows.  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 6).  Because the residual clause in the statute now before us uses almost exactly the same language as the residual clause in <i>Johnson</i>, respect for precedent alone would seem to suggest that both clauses should suffer the same judgment.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But first in <i>Johnson</i> and now again today Justice Thomas has questioned whether our vagueness doctrine can fairly claim roots in the Constitution as originally understood.  See, <i>e.g., post</i>,<i> </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x936 (dissenting opinion); <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (opinion concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x9318).  For its part, the Court has yet to offer a reply.  I believe our colleague\xe2\x80\x99s challenge is a serious and thoughtful one that merits careful attention.  At day\xe2\x80\x99s end, though, it is a challenge to which I find my- self unable to subscribe.  Respectfully, I am persuaded in- stead that void for vagueness doctrine, at least properly conceived, serves as a faithful expression of ancient due process and separation of powers principles the framers recognized as vital to ordered liberty under our Constitution. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider first the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s due process underpinnings.  The Fifth and\n \nFourteenth Amendments guarantee that \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d may not be taken \xe2\x80\x9cwithout due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  That means the government generally may not deprive a person of those rights without affording him the benefit of (at least) those \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary procedures to which freemen were entitled by the old law of England.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>Haslip</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 28 (1991)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Admittedly, some have suggested that the Due Process Clause does less work than this, allowing the government to deprive people of their liberty through whatever procedures (or lack of them) the government\xe2\x80\x99s current laws may tolerate.  <i>Post</i>, at 3, n.\xc2\xa01 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (collecting authorities).  But in my view the weight of the historical evidence shows that the clause sought to ensure that the people\xe2\x80\x99s rights are never any less secure against governmental invasion than they were at common law.  Lord Coke took this view of the English due process guarantee.  1 E. Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the Laws of England 50 (1797).  John Rutledge, our second Chief Justice, explained that Coke\xe2\x80\x99s teachings were carefully studied and widely adopted by the framers, becoming \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98almost the foundations of our law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Klopfer</i> v. <i>North Carolina</i>,\n\n386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213, 225 (1967)\n.  And many more students of the Constitution besides\xe2\x80\x94from Justice Story to Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x94have agreed that this view best represents the original understanding of our own Due Process Clause.  See, <i>e.g., Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i> v. <i>Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</i>, 18 How. 272, 277 (1856); 3 J.

Comment. 339, 341 (1987).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Perhaps the most basic of due process\xe2\x80\x99s customary protections is the demand of fair notice.  See <i>Connally</i> v. <i>General Constr.

Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 301 (1769) (Blackstone).

A civil suit began by obtaining a writ\xe2\x80\x94a detailed and specific form of action asking for particular relief.  Bellia, Article III and the Cause of Action, 89 Iowa L. Rev. 777, 784\xe2\x80\x93786 (2004); Subrin, How Equity Conquered Common Law: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in Historical Perspective, 135 U. Pa. L. Rev. 909, 914\xe2\x80\x93915 (1987).  Because the various civil writs were clearly defined, English subjects served with one would know with particularity what legal requirement they were alleged to have violated and, accordingly, what would be at issue in court.  <i>Id.</i>, at 917; Moffitt, Pleadings in the Age of Settlement, 80 Ind. L. J. 727, 731 (2005).  And a writ risked being held defective if it didn\xe2\x80\x99t provide fair notice.  <i>Goldington</i> v. <i>Bassingburn</i>, Y.\xc2\xa0B. Trin. 3 Edw. II, f. 27b (1310) (explaining that it was \xe2\x80\x9cthe law of the land\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cno one [could] be taken by surprise\xe2\x80\x9d by having to \xe2\x80\x9canswer in court for what [one] has not been warned to answer\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The requirement of fair notice applied to statutes too.  Blackstone illustrated the point with a case involving a statute that made \xe2\x80\x9cstealing sheep, or other cattle\xe2\x80\x9d a fel- ony.  1 Blackstone 88 (emphasis deleted).  Because the term \xe2\x80\x9ccattle\xe2\x80\x9d embraced a good deal more then than it does now (including wild animals, no less), the court held the statute failed to provide adequate notice about what it did and did not cover\xe2\x80\x94and so the court treated the term \xe2\x80\x9ccattle\xe2\x80\x9d as a nullity.  <i>Ibid.  </i>All of which, Blackstone added, had the salutary effect of inducing the legislature to reenter the field and make itself clear by passing a new law extending the statute to \xe2\x80\x9cbulls, cows, oxen,\xe2\x80\x9d and more \xe2\x80\x9cby name.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This tradition of courts refusing to apply vague statutes finds parallels in early American practice as well.  In <i>The Enterprise</i>, 8 F. Cas. 732 (No. 4,499) (CC NY 1810), for example, Justice Livingston found that a statute setting the circumstances in which a ship may enter a port during an embargo was too vague to be applied, concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe court had better pass\xe2\x80\x9d the statutory terms by \xe2\x80\x9cas unintelligible and useless\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cput on them, at great uncertainty, a very harsh signification, and one which the legislature may never have designed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 735.  In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sharp</i>, 27 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 1041 (No. 16,264) (CC Pa. 1815), Justice Washington confronted a statute which prohibited seamen from making a \xe2\x80\x9crevolt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 1043.<b> </b>But he was unable to determine the meaning of this provision \xe2\x80\x9cby any authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. either in the common, admiralty, or civil law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.<i> </i>As a result, he declined to \xe2\x80\x9crecommend to the jury, to find the prisoners guilty of making, or endeavouring to make a revolt, however strong the evidence may be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]<i> </i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i></i>Nor was the concern with vague laws confined to the most serious offenses like capital crimes.  Courts refused to apply vague laws in criminal cases involving relatively modest penalties.  See, <i>e.g., McJunkins</i> v. <i>State</i>, 10 Ind. 140, 145 (1858).  They applied the doctrine in civil cases too.  See, <i>e.g., Drake</i> v. <i>Drake</i>, 15 N. C. 110, 115 (1833); <i>Commonwealth</i> v. <i>Bank of Pennsylvania</i>, 3 Watts &amp; Serg. 173, 177 (Pa. 1842).  As one court put it, \xe2\x80\x9call laws\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cought to be expressed in such a manner as that its meaning may be unambiguous, and in such language as may be readily understood by those upon whom it is to operate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McConvill </i>v.<i> Mayor and Aldermen of Jersey City</i>,<i> </i>39 N.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0L. 38, 42 (1876).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98It is impossible .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to dissent from the doctrine of Lord Coke, that acts of parliament ought to be plainly and clearly, and not cunningly and darkly penned, especially in penal matters.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.           </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These early cases, admittedly, often spoke in terms of construing vague laws strictly rather than declaring them void.  See, <i>e.g., post,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion of Thomas, J.); <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x9310).  But in substance void the law is often exactly what these courts did: rather than try to construe or interpret<i> </i>the statute before them, judges frequently held the law simply too vague to apply.  Blackstone, for example, did not suggest the court in his illustration should have given a narrowing construction to the term \xe2\x80\x9ccattle,\xe2\x80\x9d but argued against giving it any effect <i>at all</i>.  1 Blackstone 88; see also Scalia, Assorted Canards of Contemporary Legal Analysis, 40 Case W. Res. L. Rev. 581, 582 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that any modern court would go to the lengths described by Blackstone in its application of the rule that penal statutes are to be strictly construed\xe2\x80\x9d); Note, Indefinite Criteria of Definiteness in Statutes, 45 Harv. L. Rev. 160, n.\xc2\xa03 (1931) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9csince strict construction, in effect, nullified ambiguous provisions, it was but a short step to declaring them void <i>ab initio</i>\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>supra,</i> at 5, n.\xc2\xa01 (state courts holding vague statutory terms \xe2\x80\x9cvoid\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cnull\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What history suggests, the structure of the Constitution confirms.  Many of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions presuppose and depend on the existence of reasonably clear laws.  Take the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that arrest warrants must be supported by probable cause, and consider what would be left of that requirement if the alleged crime had no meaningful boundaries.  Or take the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that a defendant must be informed of the accusations against him and allowed to bring witnesses in his defense, and consider what use those rights would be if the charged crime was so vague the defendant couldn\xe2\x80\x99t tell what he\xe2\x80\x99s alleged to have done and what sort of witnesses he might need to rebut that charge.  Without an assurance that the laws supply fair notice, so much else of the Constitution risks becoming only a \xe2\x80\x9cparchment barrie[r]\xe2\x80\x9d against arbitrary power. The Federalist No. 48, p.\xc2\xa0308 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (J. Madison).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although today\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness doctrine owes much to the guarantee of fair notice embodied in the Due Process Clause, it would be a mistake to overlook the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s equal debt to the separation of powers.  The Constitution assigns \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll legislative Powers\xe2\x80\x9d in our federal government to Congress.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa71.  It is for the people, through their elected representatives, to choose the rules that will govern their future conduct.  See The Federalist No. 78, at 465 (A. Hamilton) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe legislature .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prescribes the rules by which the duties and rights of every citizen are to be regulated\xe2\x80\x9d).  Meanwhile, the Constitution assigns to judges the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d to decide \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72.  That power does not license judges to craft new laws to govern future conduct, but only to \xe2\x80\x9cdiscer[n] the course prescribed by law\xe2\x80\x9d as it currently exists and to \xe2\x80\x9cfollow it\xe2\x80\x9d in resolving disputes between the people over past events.  <i>Osborn </i>v.<i> Bank of United States</i>, 9 Wheat. 738, 866 (1824).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">From this division of duties, it comes clear that legislators may not \xe2\x80\x9cabdicate their responsibilities for setting the standards of the criminal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Goguen</i>,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 566, 575 (1974)\n, by leaving to judges the power to decide \xe2\x80\x9cthe various crimes includable in [a] vague phrase,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jordan</i> v. <i>De George</i>,\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, 242 (1951)\n (Jackson, J., dissenting).  For \xe2\x80\x9cif the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large[,] [t]his would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352, 358\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (1983) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nor is the worry only that vague laws risk allowing judges to assume legislative power.  Vague laws also threaten to transfer legislative power to police and prosecutors, leaving to them the job of shaping a vague statute\xe2\x80\x99s contours through their enforcement decisions.  See <i>Grayned </i>v. <i>City of Rockford</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104, 108\n\xe2\x80\x93109 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9cA vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an <i>ad\xc2\xa0hoc</i> and subjective basis\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These structural worries are more than just formal ones.  Under the Constitution, the adoption of new laws restricting liberty is supposed to be a hard business, the product of an open and public debate among a large and diverse number of elected representatives.  Allowing the legislature to hand off the job of lawmaking risks substituting this design for one where legislation is made easy, with a mere handful of unelected judges and prosecutors free to \xe2\x80\x9ccondem[n] all that [they] personally disapprove and for no better reason than [they] disapprove it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jordan</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 242 (Jackson, J., dissenting).  Nor do judges and prosecutors act in the open and accountable forum of a legislature, but in the comparatively obscure confines of cases and controversies.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> A. Bickel, The Least Dangerous Branch: The Supreme Court at the Bar of Politics 151 (1962) (\xe2\x80\x9cA vague statute delegates to administrators, prosecutors, juries, and judges the authority of <i>ad hoc</i> decision, which is in its nature difficult if not impossible to hold to account, because of its narrow impact\xe2\x80\x9d).  For just these reasons, Hamilton warned, while \xe2\x80\x9cliberty can have nothing to fear from the judiciary alone,\xe2\x80\x9d it has \xe2\x80\x9cevery thing to fear from\xe2\x80\x9d the union of the judicial and legislative powers.  The Federalist No. 78, at 466.  No doubt, too, for reasons like these this Court has held \xe2\x80\x9cthat the <i>more important</i> aspect of vagueness doctrine \xe2\x80\x98is not actual notice, but .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the requirement that a legislature establish minimal guidelines to govern law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and keep the separate branches within their proper spheres.  <i>Kolender</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 358 (quoting <i>Goguen</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 575 (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Persuaded that vagueness doctrine enjoys a secure footing in the original understanding of the Constitution, the next question I confront concerns the standard of review.  What degree of imprecision should this Court tolerate in a statute before declaring it unconstitutionally vague?  For its part, the government argues that where (as here) a person faces only civil, not criminal, consequences from a statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation, we should declare the law unconstitutional only if it is \xe2\x80\x9cunintelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  But in the criminal context this Court has generally insisted that the law must afford \xe2\x80\x9cordinary people . . . fair notice of the conduct it punishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  And I cannot see how the Due Process Clause might often require any less than that in the civil context either.  Fair notice of the law\xe2\x80\x99s demands, as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe first essential of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Connally</i>, 269 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 391.  And as we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen, too, the Constitution sought to preserve a common law tradition that usually aimed to ensure fair notice before any deprivation of life, liberty, or property could take place, whether under the banner of the criminal or the civil law.  See<i> supra, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First principles aside, the government suggests that at least this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents support adopting a less-than-fair-notice standard for civil cases.  But even that much I do not see.  This Court has already expressly held that a \xe2\x80\x9cstringent vagueness test\xe2\x80\x9d should apply to at least some<i> </i>civil laws\xe2\x80\x94those abridging basic\n \nFirst Amendment freedoms.  <i>Hoffman Estates</i> v. <i>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 489, 499 (1982)\n.  This Court has made clear, too, that due process protections against vague laws are \xe2\x80\x9cnot to be avoided by the simple label a State chooses to fasten upon its conduct or its statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Giaccio</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>,\n\n382 U.\xc2\xa0S. 399, 402 (1966)\n.  So the happenstance that a law is found in the civil or criminal part of the statute books cannot be dispositive.  To be sure, this Court has also said that what qualifies as fair notice depends \xe2\x80\x9cin part on the nature of the enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hoffman Estates</i>, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 498.  And the Court has sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cexpressed greater tolerance of enactments with civil rather than criminal penalties because the consequences of imprecision are qualitatively less severe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 498\xe2\x80\x93499.  But to acknowledge these truisms does nothing to prove that civil laws must always be subject to the government\xe2\x80\x99s emaci- ated form of review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, if the severity of the consequences counts when deciding the standard of review, shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we also take account of the fact that today\xe2\x80\x99s civil laws regularly impose penalties far more severe than those found in many criminal statutes?  Ours is a world filled with more and more civil laws bearing more and more extravagant punishments.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccivil\xe2\x80\x9d penalties include confiscatory rather than compensatory fines, forfeiture provisions that allow homes to be taken, remedies that strip persons of their professional licenses and livelihoods, and the power to commit persons against their will indefinitely.  Some of these penalties are routinely imposed and are routinely graver than those associated with misdemeanor crimes\xe2\x80\x94and often harsher than the punishment for felonies.  And not only are \xe2\x80\x9cpunitive civil sanctions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. rapidly expanding,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9csometimes more severely punitive than the parallel criminal sanctions <i>for the same conduct</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mann, Punitive Civil Sanctions: The Middleground Between Criminal and Civil Law, 101 Yale L. J. 1795, 1798 (1992) (emphasis added).  Given all this, any suggestion that criminal cases warrant a heightened standard of review does more to persuade me that the criminal standard should be set <i>above</i> our precedent\xe2\x80\x99s current threshold than to suggest the civil standard should be buried <i>below</i> it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Retreating to a more modest line of argument, the government emphasizes that this case arises in the immigration context and so implicates matters of foreign relations where the Executive enjoys considerable constitutional authority.  But to acknowledge that the <i>President</i> has broad authority to act in this general area supplies no justification for allowing <i>judges</i> to give content to an impermissibly vague law.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Alternatively still, Justice Thomas suggests that, at least at the time of the founding, aliens present in this country may not have been understood as possessing any rights under the Due Process Clause.  For support, he points to the Alien Friends Act of 1798.  An Act Concerning Aliens \xc2\xa71,\n\n1Stat.\n571; <i>post</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  But the Alien Friends Act\xe2\x80\x94better known as the \xe2\x80\x9cAlien\xe2\x80\x9d part of the Alien and Sedition Acts\xe2\x80\x94is one of the most notorious laws in our country\xe2\x80\x99s history.  It was understood as a temporary war measure, not one that the legislature would endorse in a time of tranquility.  See, <i>e.g., </i>Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. &amp; Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 63, 70\xe2\x80\x9371 (2002).  Yet even then it was widely condemned as unconstitutional by Madison and many others.  It also went unenforced, may have cost the Federalist Party its existence, and lapsed a mere two years after its enactment.  With this fuller view, it seems doubtful the Act tells us a great deal about aliens\xe2\x80\x99 due process rights at the founding.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Besides, none of this much matters.  Whether Madison or his adversaries had the better of the debate over the constitutionality of the Alien Friends Act, Congress is surely free to extend existing forms of liberty to new classes of persons\xe2\x80\x94liberty that the government may then take only after affording due process.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Sandin</i> v. <i>Conner</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 472, 477\n\xe2\x80\x93478 (1995); Easterbrook, Substance and Due Process, 1982 S. Ct. Rev. 85, 88 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the constitution, statute, or regulation creates a liberty or property interest, then the second step\xe2\x80\x94determining \xe2\x80\x98what process is due\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94comes into play\xe2\x80\x9d).  Madison made this very point, suggesting an alien\xe2\x80\x99s admission in this country could in some circumstances be analogous to \xe2\x80\x9cthe grant of land to an individual,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cmay be of favor not of right; but the moment the grant is made, the favor becomes a right, and must be forfeited before it can be taken away.\xe2\x80\x9d  Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Report 319.  And, of course, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Congress eventually chose to do here.  Decades ago, it enacted a law affording Mr. Dimaya lawful permanent residency in this country, extending to him a statutory liberty interest others traditionally have enjoyed to remain in and move about the country free from physical imprisonment and restraint.  See <i>Dimaya</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 1110, 1111 (CA9 2015); 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(20), 1255.  No one suggests Congress <i>had </i>to enact statutes of this sort.  And exactly what processes must attend the deprivation of a statutorily afforded liberty interest like this may pose serious and debatable questions. Cf. <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 18 How., at 277 (approving summary procedures in another context).  But however summary those procedures might be, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to fathom why fair notice of the law\xe2\x80\x94the most venerable of due process\xe2\x80\x99s requirements\xe2\x80\x94would not be among them.  <i>Connally, </i>269 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at<b> </b>391.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]    </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, a plurality of the Court agrees that we should reject the government\xe2\x80\x99s plea for a feeble standard of review, but for a different reason.  <i>Ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  My colleagues suggest the law before us should be assessed under the fair notice standard because of the special grav- ity of its civil deportation penalty.  But, grave as that penalty may be, I cannot see why we would single it out for special treatment when (again) so many civil laws today impose so many similarly severe sanctions.  Why, for example, would due process require Congress to speak more clearly when it seeks to deport a lawfully resident alien than when it wishes to subject a citizen to indefinite civil commitment, strip him of a business license essential to his family\xe2\x80\x99s living, or confiscate his home?  I can think of no good answer.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With the fair notice standard now in hand, all that remains is to ask how it applies to the case before us.  And here at least the answer comes readily for me: to the extent it requires an \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d analysis, the portion of the Immigration and Nationality Act before us fails the fair notice test for the reasons Justice Scalia identified in <i>Johnson</i> and the Court recounts today.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Just like the statute in <i>Johnson</i>, the statute here instructs courts to impose special penalties on individuals previously \xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), 1101(a)(43)(F).  Just like the statute in <i>Johnson</i>, the statute here fails to specify which crimes qualify for that label.  Instead, and again like the statute in <i>Johnson</i>, the statute here seems to require a judge to guess about the ordinary case of the crime of conviction and then guess whether a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d attends its commission.\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(b); <i>Johnson</i>,<i> </i>576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  <i>Johnson</i> held that a law that asks so much of courts while offering them so little by way of guidance is unconstitutionally vague.  And I do not see how we might reach a different judgment here.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any lingering doubt is resolved for me by taking account of just some of the questions judges trying to apply the statute using an ordinary case analysis would have to confront.  Does a conviction for witness tampering ordinarily involve a threat to the kneecaps or just the promise of a bribe?  Does a conviction for kidnapping ordinarily involve throwing someone into a car trunk or a noncustodial parent picking up a child from daycare?  These questions do not suggest obvious answers.  Is the court supposed to hold evidentiary hearings to sort them out, entertaining experts with competing narratives and statistics, before deciding what the ordinary case of a given crime looks like and how much risk of violence it poses?  What is the judge to do if there aren\xe2\x80\x99t any reliable statistics available?  Should (or must) the judge predict the effects of new technology on what qualifies as the ordinary case?  After all, surely the risk of injury calculus for crimes like larceny can be expected to change as more thefts are committed by computer rather than by gunpoint.  Or instead of requiring real evidence, does the statute mean to just leave it all to a judicial hunch?  And on top of all that may be the most difficult question yet: at what level of generality is the inquiry supposed to take place?  Is a court supposed to pass on the ordinary case of burglary in the relevant neighborhood or county, or should it focus on statewide or even national experience?  How is a judge to know?  How are the people to know?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The implacable fact is that this isn\xe2\x80\x99t your everyday ambiguous statute.  It leaves the people to guess about what the law demands\xe2\x80\x94and leaves judges to make it up.  You cannot discern answers to any of the questions this law begets by resorting to the traditional canons of statutory interpretation.  No amount of staring at the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, or history will yield a clue.  Nor does the statute call for the application of some preexisting body of law familiar to the judicial power.  The statute doesn\xe2\x80\x99t even ask for application of common experience.  Choice, pure and raw, is required.  Will, not judgment, dictates the result.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having said this much, it is important to acknowledge some limits on today\xe2\x80\x99s holding too.  I have proceeded on the premise that the Immigration and Nationality Act, as it incorporates \xc2\xa716(b) of the criminal code, commands courts to determine the risk of violence attending the ordinary case of conviction for a particular crime.  I have done so because no party before us has argued for a different way to read these statutes in combination; because our precedent seemingly requires this approach; and because the government itself has conceded (repeatedly) that the law compels it.  <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 13); <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, 600 (1990)\n; Brief for Petitioner 11, 30, 32, 36, 40, 47 (conceding that an ordinary case analysis is required).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But any more than that I would not venture.  In response to the problems engendered by the ordinary case analysis, Justice Thomas suggests that we should overlook the government\xe2\x80\x99s concession about the propriety of that approach; reconsider our precedents endorsing it; and read the statute as requiring us to focus on the facts of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime as committed rather than as the facts appear in the ordinary case of conviction.  <i>Post, </i>at 20\xe2\x80\x9332.  But normally courts do not rescue parties from their concessions, maybe least of all concessions from a party as able to protect its interests as the federal government.  And normally, too, the crucible of adversarial testing is crucial to sound judicial decisionmaking.  We rely on it to \xe2\x80\x9cyield insights (or reveal pitfalls) we cannot muster guided only by our own lights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maslenjak</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While sometimes we may or even must forgo the adversarial process, I do not see the case for doing so today.  Maybe especially because I am not sure Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s is the only available alternative reading of the statute we would have to consider, even if we did reject the government\xe2\x80\x99s concession and wipe the precedential slate clean.  We might also have to consider an interpretation that would have courts ask not whether the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction ordinarily involves a risk of physical force, or whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s particular crime involved such a risk, but whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime of conviction <i>always</i> does so.  After all, the language before us requires a conviction for an \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0that, <i>by its nature</i>, involves a substantial risk of physical force.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716(b) (emphasis added).  Plausibly, anyway, the word \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d might refer to an inevitable characteristic of the offense; one that would present itself automatically, whenever the statute is violated.  See 10 Oxford English Dictionary 247 (2d ed. 1989).  While I remain open to different arguments about our precedent and the proper reading of language like this, I would address them in another case, whether involving the INA or a different statute, where the parties have a chance to be heard and we might benefit from their learning.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It\xe2\x80\x99s important to note the narrowness of our decision today in another respect too.  Vagueness doctrine represents a procedural, not a substantive, demand.  It does not forbid the legislature from acting toward any end it wishes, but only requires it to act with enough clarity that reasonable people can know what is required of them and judges can apply the law consistent with their limited office.  Our history surely bears examples of the judicial misuse of the so-called \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive component\xe2\x80\x9d of due process to dictate policy on matters that belonged to the people to decide.  But concerns with substantive due process should not lead us to react by withdrawing an ancient procedural protection compelled by the original meaning of the Constitution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision sweeps narrowly in yet one more way.  By any fair estimate, Congress has largely satisfied the procedural demand of fair notice even in the INA provision before us.  The statute lists a number of specific crimes that can lead to a lawful resident\xe2\x80\x99s removal\xe2\x80\x94for example, murder, rape, and sexual abuse of a minor.  8\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A).  Our ruling today does not touch this list.  We address only the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause\xe2\x80\x9d where Congress ended its own list and asked us to begin writing our own.  Just as Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s legislature passed a revised statute clarifying that \xe2\x80\x9ccattle\xe2\x80\x9d covers bulls and oxen, Congress remains free at any time to add more crimes to its list.  It remains free, as well, to write a new residual clause that affords the fair notice lacking here.  Congress might, for example, say that a conviction for any felony carrying a prison sentence of a specified length opens an alien to removal.  Congress has done almost exactly this in other laws.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g).  What was done there could be done here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But those laws are not this law.  And while the statute before us doesn\xe2\x80\x99t rise to the level of threatening death for \xe2\x80\x9cpretended offences\xe2\x80\x9d of treason, no one should be surprised that the Constitution looks unkindly on any law so vague that reasonable people cannot understand its terms and judges do not know where to begin in applying it.  A government of laws and not of men can never tolerate that arbitrary power.  And, in my judgment, that foundational principle dictates today\xe2\x80\x99s result.  Because I understand them to be consistent with what I have said here, I join Parts I, III, IV\xe2\x80\x93B, and V of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and concur in the judgment.  </p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Many state courts also held vague laws ineffectual.

I am also skeptical that the vagueness doctrine can be justified as a way to prevent delegations of core legislative power in this context.  But I need not resolve these questions because, if the vagueness doctrine has any basis in the Due Process Clause, it must be limited to cases in which the statute is unconstitutionally vague as applied to the person challenging it.

Like substantive due process, the vagueness doctrine provides courts with \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended authority to oversee [legislative] choices.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kolender</i> v. <i>Lawson</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 352, 374 (1983)\n (White, J., dissenting).  This Court, for example, has used the vagueness doctrine to invalidate antiloitering laws, even though those laws predate the Declaration of Independence.  See <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 7) (discussing <i>Chicago</i> v. <i>Morales</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41 (1999)\n).  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court also has a bad habit of invoking the Due Process Clause to constitutionalize rules that were traditionally left to the democratic process.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Williams</i> v. <i>Pennsylvania</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016); <i>BMW of North America, Inc.</i> v. <i>Gore</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 559 (1996)\n; <i>Foucha</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 71 (1992)\n; cf. <i>Montgomery</i> v. <i>Louisiana</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).  If vagueness is another example of this practice, then that is all the more reason to doubt its legitimacy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even assuming the Due Process Clause prohibits vague laws, this prohibition might not apply to laws governing the removal of aliens.  Cf. <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n.\xc2\xa07 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 17, n.\xc2\xa07) (stressing the need for specificity when assessing alleged due process rights).  The Founders were familiar with English law, where \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the only question that ha[d] ever been made in regard to the power to expel aliens [was] whether it could be exercised by the King without the consent of Parliament.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Demore</i> v. <i>Kim</i>,\n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 510, 538 (2003)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting <i>Fong Yue Ting</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n149 U.\xc2\xa0S. 698, 709 (1893)\n).  And, in this country, the notion that the Due Process Clause governed the removal of aliens was not announced until the 20th century.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Less than a decade after the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the founding generation had an extensive debate about the relationship between the Constitution and federal removal statutes.  In 1798, the Fifth Congress enacted the Alien Acts.  One of those Acts, the Alien Friends Act, gave the President unfettered discretion to expel any aliens \xe2\x80\x9che shall judge dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States, or shall have reasonable grounds to suspect are concerned in any treasonable or secret machinations against the government thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  An Act Concerning Aliens \xc2\xa71,\n\n1Stat.\n571.  This statute was modeled after the Aliens Act 1793 in England, which similarly gave the King unfettered discretion to expel aliens as he \xe2\x80\x9cshall think necessary for the publick Secur- ity.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 Geo. III, ch. 4, \xc2\xa718, in 39 Eng. Stat. at Large 16.  Both the Fifth Congress and the States thoroughly de- bated the Alien Friends Act.  Virginia and Kentucky enacted resolutions (anonymously drafted by Madison and Jefferson) opposing the Act, while 10 States enacted counter-resolutions condemning the views of Virginia and Kentucky.  See Fehlings, Storm on the Constitution: The First Deportation Law, 10 Tulsa J. Comp. &amp; Int\xe2\x80\x99l L. 63, 85, 103 (2002).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Jeffersonian Democratic-Republicans, who viewed the Alien Friends Act as a threat to their party and the institution of slavery,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] raised a number of constitutional objections.  Some of the Jeffersonians argued that the Alien Friends Act violated the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  They complained that the Act failed to provide aliens with all the accouterments of a criminal trial.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Kentucky Resolutions \xc2\xb66, in 4 The Debates in the Several Conventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 541\xe2\x80\x93542 (J. Elliot ed. 1836) (Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s Debates); 8 Annals of Cong. 1982\xe2\x80\x931983 (1798) (statement of Rep.

First, the Federalists argued that the rights of aliens were governed by the law of nations, not the Constitution.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> Randolph, Debate on Virginia Resolutions, in The Virginia Report of 1799\xe2\x80\x931800, pp. 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (1850) (Virginia Debates) (statement of George K.

The law of nations imposed no enforceable limits on a nation\xe2\x80\x99s power to remove aliens.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 1 E. de Vattel, Law of Nations, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7230\xe2\x80\x93231, pp. 108\xe2\x80\x93109 (J. Chitty et\xc2\xa0al. transl. and ed. 1883).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Federalists responded that the expulsion of aliens \xe2\x80\x9cdid not touch life, liberty, or property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Virginia Debates 34.  The founding generation understood the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a relatively narrow set of core private rights that did not depend on the will of the government.  See <i>Wellness Int\xe2\x80\x99l Network, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Sharif</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310); Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 559, 566\xe2\x80\x93568 (2007) (Nelson).  Quasi-private rights\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cprivileges\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfranchises\xe2\x80\x9d bestowed by the government on individuals\xe2\x80\x94did not qualify and could be taken away without judicial process.  See <i>B&amp;B Hardware, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hargis Industries, Inc.</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12); Nelson 567\xe2\x80\x93569.  The Federalists argued that an alien\xe2\x80\x99s right to reside in this country was one such privilege.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Virginia Debates 34 (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9cordering away an alien .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was not a matter of right, but of favour,\xe2\x80\x9d which did not require a jury trial); Report of the Select Committee of the House of Representatives, Made to the House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 1799, 9 Annals of Cong. 2987 (1799) (stating that aliens \xe2\x80\x9cremain in the country .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. merely as matter of favor and permission\xe2\x80\x9d and can be removed at any time without a criminal trial); Charge to the Grand Juries 11\xe2\x80\x9313 (similar).  According to the Minority Address of the Virginia Legislature (anonymously drafted by John Marshall), \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he right of remaining in our country is vested in no alien; he enters and remains by the courtesy of the sovereign power, and that courtesy may at pleasure be withdrawn\xe2\x80\x9d without judicial process.  Address of the Minority in the Virginia Legislature to the People of that State 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (1799) (Virginia Minority Address).  Unlike \xe2\x80\x9ca grant of land,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]dmission of an alien to residence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is revocable, like a permission.\xe2\x80\x9d  A. Addison, Analysis of the Report of the Committee of the Virginia Assembly 23 (1800).  Removing a resident alien from the country did not affect \xe2\x80\x9clife, lib- erty, or property,\xe2\x80\x9d the Federalists argued, until the alien became a naturalized citizen.  See <i>id.</i>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324; Charge to the Grand Juries 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  That the alien\xe2\x80\x99s permanent residence was conferred by statute would not have made a difference.  See Nelson 571, 580\xe2\x80\x93582; <i>Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc.</i> v. <i>Sandoz, Inc.</i>, 574 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, n.\xc2\xa02 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 9, n.\xc2\xa02).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After the Alien Friends Act lapsed in 1800, Congress did not enact another removal statute for nearly a century.  The States enacted their own removal statutes during this period, see G. Neuman, Strangers to the Constitution 19\xe2\x80\x9343 (1996), and I am aware of no decision questioning the legality of these statutes under State due-process or law-of-the-land provisions.  Beginning in the late 19th century, the Federal Government reinserted itself into the regulation of immigration.  When this Court was presented with constitutional challenges to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 removal laws, it initially rejected them for many of the same reasons that Marshall and the Federalists had cited in defense of the Alien Friends Act.  Although the Court rejected the Federalists\xe2\x80\x99 argument that resident aliens do not enjoy constitutional rights, see <i>Wong Wing</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n163 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228, 238 (1896)\n, it agreed that civil deportation statutes do not implicate \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <i>e.g., Harisi- ades</i> v. <i>Shaughnessy</i>,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 580, 584\n\xe2\x80\x93585 (1952) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat admission for permanent residence confers a \xe2\x80\x98vested right\xe2\x80\x99 on the alien [is] not founded in precedents of this Court\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States ex rel. Turner</i> v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n194 U.\xc2\xa0S. 279, 290 (1904)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he deportation of an alien who is found to be here in violation of law is not a deprivation of liberty without due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Fong Yue Ting</i>, 149 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 730 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Deportation] is but a method of enforcing the return to his own country of an alien who has not complied with [statutory] conditions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  He has not, therefore, been deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 713\xe2\x80\x93715 (similar).  Consistent with this understanding, \xe2\x80\x9cfederal immigration laws from 1891 until 1952 made no express provision for judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Demore</i>, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 538 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It was not until the 20th century that this Court held that nonpenal removal statutes could violate the Due Process Clause.  See <i>Wong Yang Sung </i>v. <i>McGrath</i>,\n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, 49 (1950)\n.  That ruling opened the door for the Court to apply the then-nascent vagueness doctrine to immigration statutes.  But the Court upheld vague standards in immigration laws that it likely would not have tolerated in criminal statutes.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Boutilier</i> v. <i>INS</i>,\n\n387 U.\xc2\xa0S. 118, 122 (1967)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98psychopathic personality\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Jordan</i> v. <i>De George</i>,\n\n341 U.\xc2\xa0S. 223, 232 (1951)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98crime involving moral turpitude\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>Mahler</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 40 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98undesirable residents\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Until today, this Court has never held that an immigration statute is unconstitutionally vague.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, for more than a century after the founding, it was, at best, unclear whether federal removal statutes could violate the Due Process Clause.  And until today, this Court had never deemed a federal removal statute void for vagueness.  Given this history, it is difficult to conclude that a ban on vague removal statutes is a \xe2\x80\x9csettled usag[e] and mod[e] of proceeding existing in the common and statute law of England, before the emigration of our ancestors\xe2\x80\x9d protected by the\n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause.  <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 18 How., at 277.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Instead of a longstanding procedure under <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, perhaps the vagueness doctrine is really a way to enforce the separation of powers\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the doctrine of nondelegation.  See Chapman &amp; McConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 1672, 1806 (2012) (\xe2\x80\x9cVague statutes have the effect of delegating lawmaking authority to the executive\xe2\x80\x9d).  Madison raised a similar objection to the Alien Friends Act, arguing that its expansive language effectively allowed the President to exercise legislative (and judicial) power.  See Madison\xe2\x80\x99s Report 369\xe2\x80\x93371.  And this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have occasionally described the vagueness doctrine in terms of nondelegation.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Grayned</i> v. <i>City of Rockford</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104, 108\n\xe2\x80\x93109 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9cA vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters\xe2\x80\x9d).  But they have not been consistent on this front.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Aptheker</i> v. <i>Secretary of State</i>,\n\n378 U.\xc2\xa0S. 500, 516 (1964)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The objectionable qual- ity of vagueness .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. does not depend upon .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unchanneled delegation of legislative powers\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Maynard</i> v. <i>Cartwright</i>,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 356, 361 (1988)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cObjections to vagueness under the Due Process Clause rest on the lack of notice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I agree that the Constitution prohibits Congress from delegating core legislative power to another branch.  See <i>Department of Transportation</i> v. <i>Association of American Railroads</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (<i>AAR</i>) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress improperly \xe2\x80\x98delegates\xe2\x80\x99 legislative power when it authorizes an entity other than itself to make a determination that requires an exercise of legislative power\xe2\x80\x9d); accord, <i>Whitman</i> v. <i>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</i>,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457, 487 (2001)\n (Thomas, J., concurring).  But I locate that principle in the Vesting Clauses of Articles I, II, and III\xe2\x80\x94not in the Due Process Clause.  <i>AAR,</i> <i>supra</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)

In my view, impermissible delegations of legislative power violate this principle, not just delegations that deprive individuals of \xe2\x80\x9clife, liberty, or property,\xe2\x80\x9d Amdt. 5.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent does not argue that \xc2\xa716(b), as incorporated by the INA, is an impermissible delegation of power.  See Brief for Respondent 50 (stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no delegation question\xe2\x80\x9d in this case).  I would not reach that question here, because this case can be resolved on narrower grounds.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93C, <i>infra</i>.  But at first blush, it is not at all obvious that the nondelegation doctrine would jus- tify wholesale invalidation of \xc2\xa716(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If \xc2\xa716(b) delegates power in this context, it delegates power primarily to the Executive Branch entities that administer the INA\xe2\x80\x94namely, the Attorney General, immigration judges, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).  But Congress does not \xe2\x80\x9cdelegate\xe2\x80\x9d when it merely authorizes the Executive Branch to exercise a power that it already has.  See <i>AAR</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.) (slip op., at 3).  And there is some founding-era evidence that \xe2\x80\x9cthe executive Power,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71, includes the power to deport aliens.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Blackstone\xe2\x80\x94one of the political philosophers whose writings on executive power were \xe2\x80\x9cmost familiar to the Framers,\xe2\x80\x9d Prakash &amp; Ramsey, The Executive Power Over Foreign Affairs, 111 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 231, 253 (2001)\xe2\x80\x94described the power to deport aliens as executive and located it with the King.  Alien friends, Blackstone explained, are \xe2\x80\x9cliable to be sent home whenever the king sees occasion.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Commentaries on the Laws of England 252 (1765).  When our Constitution was ratified, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]minent English judges, sitting in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, ha[d] gone very far in supporting the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. expulsion, by the executive authority of a colony, of aliens.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Demore</i>, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 538 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.)

See, <i>e.g., </i>Virginia Debates 35 (statement of George K. Taylor) (arguing that the power to remove aliens is \xe2\x80\x9cmost properly entrusted\xe2\x80\x9d with the President, since \xe2\x80\x9c[h]e, by the Constitution, was bound to execute the laws\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cthe executive officer, with whom all persons and bodies whatever were accustomed to communicate\xe2\x80\x9d); Virginia Minority Address 9 (arguing that the removal of aliens \xe2\x80\x9cis a measure of general safety, in its nature political and not forensic, the execution of which is properly trusted to the department which represents the nation in all its interior relations\xe2\x80\x9d); Charge to the Grand Juries 29\xe2\x80\x9330 (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a measure of national defence, this discretion, of expulsion or indulgence, seems properly vested in the branch of the government peculiarly charged with the direction of the executive powers, and of our foreign relations.

More recently, this Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]emoval decisions\xe2\x80\x9d implicate \xe2\x80\x9cour customary policy of deference to the President in matters of foreign affairs\xe2\x80\x9d because they touch on \xe2\x80\x9cour relations with foreign powers and require consideration of changing political and economic circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jama</i> v. <i>Immigration and Customs Enforcement</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 335, 348 (2005)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).

I assume that, at some point, a statute could be so devoid of content that a court tasked with interpreting it \xe2\x80\x9cwould simply be making up a law\xe2\x80\x94that is, exercising legislative power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawson, Delegation and Original Meaning, 88 Va.

If the vagueness doctrine has any basis in the original meaning of the Due Process Clause, it must be limited to case-by-case challenges to particular applications of a statute.  That is what early American courts did when they applied the rule of lenity.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 10).  And that is how early American courts addressed constitutional challenges to statutes more generally.  See <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is good evidence that [antebellum] courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. understood judicial review to consist \xe2\x80\x98of a refusal to give a statute effect as operative law in resolving a case,\xe2\x80\x99 a notion quite distinct from our modern practice of \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cstrik[ing] down\xe2\x80\x9d legislation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Walsh, Partial Unconstitutionality, 85 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U.

See <i>Holder</i> v. <i>Humanitarian Law Project</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 18\n\xe2\x80\x9319 (2010); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Williams</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 285, 304 (2008)\n; <i>Maynard</i>, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 361; <i>Hoffman Estates </i>v. <i>Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 489, 495\n, and n.\xc2\xa07 (1982) (collecting cases).  <i>Johnson </i>did not overrule these precedents.  While <i>Johnson</i> weakened the principle that a facial challenge requires a statute to be vague \xe2\x80\x9cin <i>all</i> applications,\xe2\x80\x9d 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (emphasis added), it did not address whether a statute must be vague as applied to the person challenging it.  That question did not arise because the Court concluded that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause was vague as applied to the crime at issue there: unlawful possession of a short-barreled shotgun.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 9).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In my view, \xc2\xa716(b) is not vague as applied to respondent.  When respondent committed his burglaries in 2007 and 2009, he was \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently forewarned .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the statutory consequence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is deportation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>De George</i>, 341 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 232.

Residential burglary \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] been considered a violent offense for hundreds of years .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of the potential for mayhem if burglar encounters resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Pinto</i>, 875 F.\xc2\xa02d 143, 144 (CA7 1989).  The Model Penal Code had recognized that risk, see ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7221.1, Comment 3(c), p. 75 (1980); the Sentencing Commission had recognized that risk; see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2006); and this Court had repeatedly recognized that risk, see, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192, 203 (2007)\n;<i> Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575, 588 (1990)\n.  In <i>Leocal </i>v.<i> Ashcroft</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2004)\n, this Court unanimously agreed that burglary is the \xe2\x80\x9cclassic example\xe2\x80\x9d of a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(b), because it \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That same risk is present with respect to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s statute of conviction\xe2\x80\x94first-degree residential burglary, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7459, 460(a) (West 1999).  The California Supreme Court has explained that the State\xe2\x80\x99s burglary laws recognize \xe2\x80\x9cthe dangers to personal safety created by the <i>usual</i> burglary situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>People</i> v. <i>Davis</i>, <a class="related-case" href="/cases/california/supreme-court/4th/18/712.html">18 Cal. 4th 712</a>, 721, 958 P.\xc2\xa02d 1083, 1089 (1998) (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he fact that a building is used as a home .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. increases such danger,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which is why California elevates residential burglary to a first-degree offense.  <i>People</i> v. <i>Rodriguez</i>, 122 Cal.

Although unlawful entry is not an element of the offense, courts \xe2\x80\x9cunanimous[ly]\xe2\x80\x9d agree that the offense still involves a substantial risk of physical force.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Avila</i>, 770 F.\xc2\xa03d 1100, 1106 (CA4 2014); accord, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Maldonado</i>, 696 F.\xc2\xa03d 1095, 1102, 1104 (CA10 2012); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Scanlan</i>, 667 F.\xc2\xa03d 896, 900 (CA7 2012); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Echeverria\xe2\x80\x93Gomez</i>, 627 F.\xc2\xa03d 971, 976 (CA5 2010); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Becker</i>, 919 F.\xc2\xa02d 568, 573 (CA9 1990).  First-degree residential burglary requires entry into an inhabited dwelling, with the intent to commit a felony, against the will of the homeowner\xe2\x80\x94the key elements that create the risk of violence.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Park</i>, 649 F.\xc2\xa03d 1175, 1178\xe2\x80\x931180 (CA9 2011); <i>Avila</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 1106\xe2\x80\x931107; <i>Becker</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 571, n.\xc2\xa05.  As this Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he main risk of burglary arises not from the simple physical act of wrongfully entering onto another\xe2\x80\x99s property, but rather from the possibility of a face-to-face confrontation between the burglar and a third party.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 203.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Drawing on <i>Johnson</i> and the decision below, the Court suggests that residential burglary might not be a crime of violence because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98only about seven percent of burglaries actually involve violence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9, n.\xc2\xa03 (citing <i>Dimaya</i> v. <i>Lynch</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 1110, 1116, n.\xc2\xa07 (CA9 2015)); see Bureau of Justice Statistics, S. Catalano, National Crime Victimization Survey: Victimization During Household Burglary 1 (Sept. 2010), https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/ pdf/vdhb.pdf (as last visited Apr. 13, 2018).  But this statistic\xe2\x80\x94which measures actual violence against a member of the household, see <i>id.,</i> at 1, 12\xe2\x80\x94is woefully underinclusive.  It excludes other potential victims besides household members\xe2\x80\x94for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca police officer, or a bystande[r] who comes to investigate,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>James</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 203.  And \xc2\xa716(b) requires only a risk of physical force, not actual physical force, and that risk would seem to be present whenever someone is home during the burglary.  Further, <i>Johnson </i>is not conclusive because, unlike ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, \xc2\xa716(b) covers offenses that involve a substantial risk of physical force \xe2\x80\x9cagainst the person <i>or property</i> of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Surely the ordinary case of residential burglary involves at least one of these risks.  According to the statistics referenced by the Court, most burglaries involve either a forcible entry (<i>e.g., </i>breaking a window or slashing a door screen), an attempted forcible entry, or an unlawful entry when someone is home.  See Bureau of Justice Statistics, <i>supra,</i> at 2 (Table 1).  Thus, under any metric, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s convictions for first-degree residential burglary are crimes of violence under \xc2\xa716(b).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, if facial vagueness challenges are ever appropriate, I adhere to my view that a law is not facially vague \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]f any fool would know that a particular category of conduct would be within the reach of the statute, if there is an unmistakable core that a reasonable person would know is forbidden by the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morales</i>, 527 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 112 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Kolender</i>, 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 370\xe2\x80\x93371 (White, J., dissenting)).  The residual clause of ACCA had such a core.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10); <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315).  And \xc2\xa716(b) has an even wider core, as The Chief Justice explains.  Thus, the Court should not have invalidated \xc2\xa716(b), either on its face or as applied to respondent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even taking the vagueness doctrine and <i>Johnson </i>at face value, I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to invalidate \xc2\xa716(b).  The sole reason that the Court deems \xc2\xa716(b) unconstitutionally vague is because it reads the statute as incorporating the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d approach from ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  Although the Court mentions \xe2\x80\x9c[t]wo features\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa716(b) that make it vague\xe2\x80\x94the ordinary-case approach and an imprecise risk standard\xe2\x80\x94the Court admits that the second feature is problematic only in combination with the first.  <i>Ante,</i> at 8.  Without the ordinary-case approach, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cdo[es] not doubt\xe2\x80\x9d the constitutionality of \xc2\xa716(b).  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But if the categorical approach renders \xc2\xa716(b) unconstitutionally vague, then constitutional avoidance requires us to make a reasonable effort to avoid that interpretation.  And a reasonable alternative interpretation is available: Instead of asking whether the ordinary case of an alien\xe2\x80\x99s offense presents a substantial risk of physical force, courts should ask whether the alien\xe2\x80\x99s actual underlying conduct presents a substantial risk of physical force.  I will briefly discuss the origins of the categorical approach and then explain why the Court should abandon it for \xc2\xa716(b).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-H2">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The categorical approach originated with Justice Blackmun\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court in <i>Taylor</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575 (1990)\n.  The question in <i>Taylor</i> was whether ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d meant burglary as defined by state law or burglary in the generic sense.  After \xe2\x80\x9cdevoting 10 pages of [its] opinion to legislative history,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 603 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), and finding that Congress had made \xe2\x80\x9can inadvertent casualty in [the] complex drafting process,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 589\xe2\x80\x93590 (majority opinion), the Court concluded that ACCA referred to burglary in the generic sense, <i>id.,</i> at 598.  The Court then addressed how the Government would prove that a defendant was convicted of generic burglary, as opposed to another offense.  <i>Id.,</i> at 599\xe2\x80\x93602.  <i>Taylor</i> rejected the notion that the Government could introduce evidence about the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular facts\xe2\x80\x9d of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s underlying crime.  <i>Id.,</i> at 600.  Instead, the Court adopted a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d which focused primarily on the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory definition of the prior offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 602.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although <i>Taylor </i>was interpreting one of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated offenses, this Court later extended the categorical approach to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  See <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 208.  That extension required some reworking.  Because ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s enumerated-offenses clause asks whether a prior conviction \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), <i>Taylor</i> instructed courts to focus on the definition of the underlying crime.  The residual clause, by contrast, asks whether a prior conviction \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Thus, the Court held that the categorical approach for the residual clause asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, <i>in the ordinary case</i>, presents a serious potential risk of injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 208 (emphasis added).  This \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d approach allowed courts to apply the residual clause without inquiring into the individual facts of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior crime.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Taylor</i> gave a few reasons why the categorical approach was the correct reading of ACCA, see 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 600\xe2\x80\x93601, but the \xe2\x80\x9cheart of the decision\xe2\x80\x9d was the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern with limiting the amount of evidence that the parties could introduce at sentencing.  <i>Shepard</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, 23 (2005)\n.  Specifically, the Court was worried about potential violations of the\n \nSixth Amendment.  If the parties could introduce evidence about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s underlying conduct, then sentencing proceedings might devolve into a full-blown minitrial, with factfinding by the judge instead of the jury.  See <i>id.</i>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9326; <i>Taylor</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 601.  While this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Almendarez-Torres</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224 (1998)\n, allows judges to find facts about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions, a full-blown minitrial would look \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much like\xe2\x80\x9d the kind of factfinding that the\n \nSixth Amendment requires the jury to conduct.  <i>Shepard</i>, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25.  By construing ACCA to require a categorical approach, then, the Court was following \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he rule of reading statutes to avoid serious risks of unconstitutionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I disagreed with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to extend the categorical approach to ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  See <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 231\xe2\x80\x93232 (dissenting opinion).  The categorical approach was an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unnecessary exercise,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d I explained, because it created the same\n \nSixth Amendment problem that it tried to avoid.  <i>Id.,</i> at 231.  Absent waiver, a defendant has the right to have a jury find \xe2\x80\x9cevery fact that is by law a basis for imposing or increasing punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d including the fact of a prior conviction.  <i>Apprendi</i> v. <i>New Jersey</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 466, 501 (2000)\n (Thomas, J., concurring).  The exception recognized in <i>Almendarez-Torres </i>for prior convictions is an aberration, has been seriously undermined by subsequent precedents, and should be reconsidered.  See <i>Mathis</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (Thomas, J., concurring) (slip op., at 1); <i>Shepard</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9328 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  In my view, if the Government wants to enhance a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence based on his prior convictions, it must put those convictions in the indictment and prove them to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">My objection aside, the ordinary-case approach soon created problems of its own.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to avoid the Scylla of the\n \nSixth Amendment steered it straight into the Charybdis of the Fifth.  The ordinary-case approach that was created to honor the individual right to a jury is now, according to the Court, so vague that it deprives individuals of due process.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I see no good reason for the Court to persist in reading the ordinary-case approach into \xc2\xa716(b).  The text of \xc2\xa716(b) does not mandate the ordinary-case approach, the concerns that led this Court to adopt it do not apply here, and there are no prudential reasons for retaining it.  In my view, we should abandon the categorical approach for \xc2\xa716(b).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text of \xc2\xa716(b) does not require a categorical approach.  The INA declares an alien deportable if he is  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\xe2\x80\x9cconvicted of an aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d after he is admitted to the United States.\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  Aggravated felonies include \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as defined in \xc2\xa716.  \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F).  Section 16, in turn, defines crimes of violence as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin"> \xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82an offense that has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another, or</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd"> \xe2\x80\x9c(b)\xe2\x80\x82any other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At first glance, \xc2\xa716(b) is not clear about the precise question it poses.  On the one hand, the statute might refer to the metaphysical \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d of the offense and ask whether it ordinarily involves a substantial risk of physical force.  On the other hand, the statute might refer to the underlying facts of the offense that the offender committed; the words \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d would mean only that an offender who engages in risky conduct cannot benefit from the fortuitous fact that physical force was not actually used during his offense.  The text can bear either interpretation.  See <i>Nijhawan</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 29, 33\n\xe2\x80\x9334 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n ordinary speech words such as \xe2\x80\x98crime,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98felony,\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98offense,\xe2\x80\x99 and the like sometimes refer to a generic crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and sometimes refer to the specific acts in which an offender engaged on a specific occasion\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is entirely natural to use words like \xe2\x80\x9cnature\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to an offender\xe2\x80\x99s actual underlying conduct.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although both interpretations are linguistically possible, several factors indicate that the underlying-conduct approach is the better one.  To begin, \xc2\xa716(b) asks whether an offense \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d a substantial risk of force.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the offense must <i>necessarily</i> include a substantial risk of force.  See The New Oxford Dictionary of English 962 (2001) (\xe2\x80\x9cinclude (something) as a necessary part or result\xe2\x80\x9d); Random House Dictionary of the English Language 1005 (2d ed. 1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c1. to include as  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">a necessary circumstance, condition, or consequence\xe2\x80\x9d); Oxford American Dictionary 349 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9c1. to contain within itself, to make necessary as a condition or result\xe2\x80\x9d).  That condition is always satisfied if the Government must prove that the alien\xe2\x80\x99s underlying conduct involves a substantial risk of force, but it is not always satisfied if the Government need only prove that the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d involves such a risk.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).  Tellingly, the other aggravated felonies in the INA that use the word \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d employ the underlying-conduct approach.  See\n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i) (\xe2\x80\x9can offense that involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71101(h)(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cany crime of reckless driving or of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d).  As do the similarly worded provisions of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, the bill that contained \xc2\xa716(b).  See, <i>e.g.,</i>\n\n98Stat.\n2059 (elevating the burden of proof for the release of \xe2\x80\x9ca person found not guilty only by reason of insanity of an offense involving bodily injury to, or serious damage to the property of, another person, or involving a substantial risk of such injury or damage\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 2068 (establishing the sentence for drug offenses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving\xe2\x80\x9d specific quantities and types of drugs); <i>id., </i>at 2137 (defining violent crimes in aid of racketeering to include \xe2\x80\x9cattempting or conspiring to commit a crime involving maiming, assault with a dangerous weapon, or assault resulting in serious bodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A comparison of \xc2\xa716(b) and \xc2\xa716(a) further highlights why the former likely adopts an underlying-conduct approach.  Section 16(a) covers offenses that have the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force \xe2\x80\x9cas an element.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because \xc2\xa716(b) covers \xe2\x80\x9cother\xe2\x80\x9d offenses and is separated from \xc2\xa716(a) by the disjunctive word \xe2\x80\x9cor,\xe2\x80\x9d the natural inference is that \xc2\xa716(b) asks a different<i> </i>question.  In other words, \xc2\xa716(b) must require immigration judges to look beyond the elements of an offense to determine whether it involves a substantial risk of physical force.  But if the elements are insufficient, where else should immigration judges look to determine the riskiness of an offense?  Two options are possible, only one of which is workable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first option is to consult the underlying facts of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime and then assess its riskiness.  This approach would provide a definitive answer in every case.  And courts are already familiar with this kind of inquiry.  Cf. <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 12) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cdozens\xe2\x80\x9d of similarly worded laws ask courts to assess \xe2\x80\x9cthe riskiness of conduct in which an individual defendant engages <i>on a particular occasion</i>\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing suggests that Congress imposed a more limited inquiry when it enacted \xc2\xa716(b) in 1984.  At the time, Congress had not yet enacted ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, this Court had not yet created the categorical approach, and this Court had not yet recognized a\n \nSixth Amendment limit on judicial factfinding at sentencing, see <i>Chambers </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122, 132 (2009)\n (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second option is to imagine the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s crime and then assess the riskiness of that hypothetical offense.  But the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear in the statute.  And imagining the ordinary case, the Court reminds us, is \xe2\x80\x9chopeless[ly] indetermina[te],\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cwholly \xe2\x80\x98speculative,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and mere \xe2\x80\x9cguesswork.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 7, 24 (quoting <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5, 7)); see also <i>Chambers</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 133 (opinion of Alito, J.) (observing that the categorical approach is \xe2\x80\x9cnearly impossible to apply consistently\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because courts disfavor interpretations that make a statute impossible to apply, see A.\xc2\xa0Scalia &amp; B.\xc2\xa0Garner, Reading Law 63 (2012), this Court should reject the ordinary-case approach for \xc2\xa716(b) and adopt the underlying-facts approach instead.  See <i>Johnson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 10) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen another interpretation is ready at hand, why should we assume that Congress gave the clause a meaning that is impossible\xe2\x80\x94or even, exceedingly difficult\xe2\x80\x94to apply\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">That the categorical approach is not the better reading of \xc2\xa716(b) should not be surprising, since the categorical approach was never really about the best reading of the text.  As explained, this Court adopted that approach to avoid a potential\n \nSixth Amendment problem with sentencing judges conducting minitrials to determine a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct.  But even assuming the categorical approach solved this\n \nSixth Amendment problem in criminal cases, no such problem arises in immigration cases.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he provisions of the Constitution securing the right of trial by jury have no application\xe2\x80\x9d in a removal proceeding.  <i>Turner</i>, 194 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 290.  And, in criminal cases, the underlying-conduct approach would be perfectly constitutional if the Government included the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior conduct in the indictment, tried it to a jury, and proved it beyond a reasonable doubt.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12).  Nothing in \xc2\xa716(b) prohibits the Government from proceeding this way, so the plurality is wrong to suggest that the underlying-conduct approach would necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cping-pong us from one constitutional issue to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If constitutional avoidance applies here at all, it requires us to <i>reject </i>the categorical approach for \xc2\xa716(b).  According to the Court, the categorical approach is unconstitutionally vague.  And, all agree that the underlying-conduct approach would not be.  See <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 12) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e do not doubt the constitutionality of laws that call for the application of a qualitative standard such as \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99 to real-world conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, if the underlying-conduct approach is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonabl[e]\xe2\x80\x9d interpretation of \xc2\xa716(b), it is our \xe2\x80\x9cplain duty\xe2\x80\x9d to adopt it.  <i>United States ex rel. Attorney General</i> v. <i>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.</i>,\n\n213 U.\xc2\xa0S. 366, 407 (1909)\n.  And it is reasonable, as explained above.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Johnson</i>, the Court declined to adopt the underlying-conduct approach for ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause.  See 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313).  The Court concluded that the categorical approach was the only reasonable reading of ACCA because the residual clause uses the word \xe2\x80\x9cconvictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 13).  The Court also stressed the \xe2\x80\x9cutter impracticability of requiring a sentencing court to reconstruct, long after the original conviction, the conduct underlying that conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither of these arguments is persuasive with respect to the INA.  Moreover, this Court has already rejected them.  In <i>Nijhawan</i>, this Court unanimously concluded that one of the aggravated felonies in the INA\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9can offense that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involves fraud or deceit in which the loss to the victim or victims exceeds $10,000,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(M)(i)\xe2\x80\x94applies the underlying-conduct approach, not the categorical approach.  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 32.  Although the INA also refers to \xe2\x80\x9cconvict[ions],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(iii), the Court was not swayed by that argument.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cconvict[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d means only that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s underlying conduct must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98be tied to the specific counts covered by the conviction,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cacquitted or dismissed counts or general conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 42.  As for the supposed practical problems with proving an alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conduct, the Court did not find that argument persuasive either.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \xe2\x80\x98sole purpose\xe2\x80\x99 of the \xe2\x80\x98aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is to ascertain the nature of a prior conviction; it is not an invitation to relitigate the conviction itself.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And because the INA places the burden on the Government to prove an alien\xe2\x80\x99s conduct by clear and convincing evidence, \xc2\xa71229a(c)(3)(A), \xe2\x80\x9cuncertainties caused by the passage of time are likely to count in the alien\xe2\x80\x99s favor,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 42.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There are additional reasons why the practical problems identified in <i>Johnson </i>should not matter for \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x94even assuming they should have mattered for ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, see <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205, 217 (2010)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not our task to assess the consequences of each approach and adopt the one that produces the least mischief.  Our charge is to give effect to the law Congress enacted\xe2\x80\x9d).  In a removal proceeding, any difficulties with identifying an alien\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct will fall on immigration judges, not federal courts.  But those judges are already accustomed to finding facts about the conduct underlying an alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior convictions, since some of the INA\xe2\x80\x99s aggravated felonies employ the underlying-conduct approach.  The BIA has instructed immigration judges to determine such conduct based on \xe2\x80\x9cany evidence admissible in re- moval proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d not just the elements of the offense or the record of conviction.  See <i>Matter of Babaisakov</i>, 24 I. &amp; N. Dec. 306, 307 (2007).  No one has submitted any evidence that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach has been \xe2\x80\x9cutter[ly] impracticab[le]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdaunting[ly] difficul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d in practice.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  And even if it were, \xe2\x80\x9chow much time the agency wants to devote to the resolution of particular issues is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a question for the agency itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ali</i> v. <i>Mukasey</i>, 521 F.\xc2\xa03d 737, 741 (CA7 2008).  Hypothetical burdens on the BIA should not influence how this Court interprets \xc2\xa716(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, we should not blithely assume that the reasons why this Court adopted the categorical approach for ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause also apply to the INA\xe2\x80\x99s list of aggravated felonies.  As <i>Nijhawan</i> explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98aggravated felony\xe2\x80\x99 statute, unlike ACCA, contains some language that refers to generic crimes and some language that almost certainly refers to the specific circumstances in which a crime was committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 38.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe question\xe2\x80\x9d in each case is \xe2\x80\x9cto which category [the aggra- vated felony] belongs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  As I have explained, \xc2\xa716(b) belongs in the underlying-conduct category.  Because that is the better reading of \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text\xe2\x80\x94or at least a reasonable reading\xe2\x80\x94the Court should have adopted it here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I see no prudential reason for maintaining the categorical approach for \xc2\xa716(b).  The Court notes that the Government \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly acknowledges\xe2\x80\x9d that \xc2\xa716(b) employs the categorical approach.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  But we cannot permit the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concessions to dictate how we interpret a statute, much less cause us to invalidate a statute enacted by a coordinate branch.  See <i>United States Nat. Bank of Ore.</i> v. <i>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 439, 446\n\xe2\x80\x93447 (1993); <i>Young</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 257, 258\n\xe2\x80\x93259 (1942).  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional practice\xe2\x80\x9d is to \xe2\x80\x9crefus[e] to decide constitutional questions\xe2\x80\x9d when other grounds of decision are available, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not they have been properly raised before us by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Neese</i> v. <i>Southern R.

L.\xc2\xa0J. 1945, 1948\xe2\x80\x931949 (1997) (explaining that courts commonly \xe2\x80\x9cdecide an antecedent statutory issue, even one waived by the parties, if its resolution could preclude a constitutional claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has raised potential saving constructions \xe2\x80\x9con our own motion\xe2\x80\x9d when they could avoid a ruling on constitutional vagueness grounds, even in cases where the Government was a party.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</i>,\n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 81, 88 (1921)\n.  We should have followed that established practice here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor should <i>stare decisis</i> prevent us from rejecting the categorical approach for \xc2\xa716(b).  This Court has never held that \xc2\xa716(b) incorporates the ordinary-case approach.  Although <i>Leocal</i> held that \xc2\xa716(b) incorporates a version of the categorical approach, the Court must not feel bound by that decision, as it largely overrules it today.  See <i>ante,</i> at 22, n.\xc2\xa07.  Surely the Court cannot credibly invoke <i>stare decisis</i> to defend the categorical approach\xe2\x80\x94the same approach it says only a \xe2\x80\x9clunatic\xe2\x80\x9d would continue to apply.  <i>Ante, </i>at 24.  If the Court views the categorical approach that way\xe2\x80\x94the same way <i>Johnson </i>viewed it\xe2\x80\x94then it must also agree that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tanding by [the categorical approach] would undermine, rather than promote, the goals that <i>stare decisis</i> is meant to serve.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  That is especially true if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision leads to the invalidation of scores of similarly worded state and federal statutes, which seems even more likely after today than it did after <i>Johnson</i>.  Instead of adhering to an interpretation that it thinks unconstitutional and then using that interpretation to strike down another statute, the Court should have taken this opportunity to abandon the categorical approach for \xc2\xa716(b) once and for all.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today is triply flawed.  It unnecessarily extends our incorrect decision in <i>Johnson</i>.  It uses a constitutional doctrine with dubious origins to invalidate yet another statute (while calling into question countless more).  And it does all this in the name of a statutory interpretation that we should have discarded long ago.

Applying that standard to the state offense at issue, we concluded\xe2\x80\x94unanimously\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa716(b) \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be read to include [a] conviction for DUI causing serious bodily injury under Florida law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Leocal </i>thus provides a model for how courts should assess whether a particular crime \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature\xe2\x80\x9d involves a risk of the use of physical force.  At the outset, our opinion set forth the elements of the Florida DUI statute, which made it a felony \xe2\x80\x9cfor a person to operate a vehicle while under the influence and, \xe2\x80\x98by reason of such operation, caus[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Our \xc2\xa716(b) analysis, in turn, focused on those specific elements in concluding that a Florida offender\xe2\x80\x99s acts would not naturally give rise to the requisite risk of force \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 11.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn no \xe2\x80\x98ordinary or natural\xe2\x80\x99 sense,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9ccan it be said that a person risks having to \xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 physical force against another person in the course of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and causing injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court holds that the same provision we had no trouble applying in <i>Leocal </i>is in fact incapable of reasoned application.  The sole justification for this turnabout is the resemblance between the language of \xc2\xa716(b) and the language of the residual clause of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA) that was at issue in <i>Johnson</i>.  The latter provision defined a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, <i>or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.</i>\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Johnson</i>, we<i> </i>concluded that the ACCA residual clause (the \xe2\x80\x9cor otherwise\xe2\x80\x9d language) gave rise to two forms of intractable uncertainty, which \xe2\x80\x9cconspire[d]\xe2\x80\x9d to render the provision unconstitutionally vague.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  First, the residual clause asked courts to gauge the \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury\xe2\x80\x9d posed by the conduct involved in the crime.  <i>Ibid.</i>  That inquiry, we determined, entailed not only an evaluation of the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x99s behavior,\xe2\x80\x9d but also required courts to consider \xe2\x80\x9chow the idealized ordinary case of the crime subsequently plays out.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Second, the residual clause obligated courts to compare that risk to an indeterminate standard\xe2\x80\x94one that was inextricably linked to the provision\xe2\x80\x99s four enumerated crimes, which presented differing kinds and degrees of risk.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 6).  This murky confluence of features, each of which \xe2\x80\x9cmay [have been] tolerable in isolation,\xe2\x80\x9d together \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] a task for us which at best could be only guesswork.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 16(b) does not present the same ambiguities.<i> </i>The two provisions do correspond to some extent.  Under our decisions, both ask the sentencing court to consider whether a particular offense, defined without regard to the facts of the conviction, poses a specified risk.  And, relevant to both statutes, we have explained that in deciding whether statutory elements inherently produce a risk, a court must take into account how those elements will ordinarily be fulfilled.  See <i>James</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192, 208 (2007)\n (this categorical inquiry asks \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the conduct encompassed by the elements of the offense, in the ordinary case, presents\xe2\x80\x9d the requisite risk).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, that effectively resolves this case.  But the Court too readily dismisses the significant textual distinctions between \xc2\xa716(b) and the ACCA residual clause.  See also <i>ante,</i> at 2 (opinion of Gorsuch, J.).  Those differences undermine the conclusion that \xc2\xa716(b) shares each of the \xe2\x80\x9cdual flaws\xe2\x80\x9d of that clause.  <i>Ante,</i> at 21 (majority opinion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To begin, \xc2\xa716(b) yields far less uncertainty \xe2\x80\x9cabout how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  There are three material differences between \xc2\xa716(b) and the ACCA residual clause in this respect.  First, the ACCA clause directed the reader to consider whether the offender\xe2\x80\x99s conduct presented a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>potential</i> risk\xe2\x80\x9d of injury.  Forced to give meaning to that befuddling choice of phrase\xe2\x80\x94which layered one indeterminate term on top of another\xe2\x80\x94we understood the word \xe2\x80\x9cpotential\xe2\x80\x9d to signify that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended to encompass possibilities even more contingent or remote than \xe2\x80\x9ca simple \xe2\x80\x98risk.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 207\xe2\x80\x93208.  As we explained in <i>Johnson</i>, that made for a \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cdetached from statutory elements.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  In other words, the offense elements could not constrain the risk inquiry in the manner they do here.  See <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11.  The \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard also forced courts to assess in an expansive way the \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequences\xe2\x80\x9d of the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s acts.  For example, courts had to take into account the concern that <i>others </i>might cause injury in attempting to apprehend the offender.  See <i>Sykes</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 8\n\xe2\x80\x939 (2011).  Section 16(b), on the other hand, asks about \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d alone, a familiar concept of everyday life.  It therefore calls for a commonsense inquiry that does not compel a court to venture beyond the offense elements to consider contingent and remote possibilities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, \xc2\xa716(b) focuses exclusively on the risk that the offender will \xe2\x80\x9cuse[ ]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cagainst\xe2\x80\x9d another person or another person\xe2\x80\x99s property.  Thus, unlike the ACCA residual clause, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa716(b) plainly does not encompass all offenses which create a \xe2\x80\x98substantial risk\xe2\x80\x99 that <i>injury</i> <i>will result from</i> a person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Leocal,</i> 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10, n.\xc2\xa07 (emphasis added).  The point is not that an inquiry into the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical force\xe2\x80\x9d is markedly more determinate than an inquiry into the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cphysical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  But see <i>ante,</i> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  The difference is that \xc2\xa716(b) asks about the risk that the offender himself will <i>actively employ </i>force against person or property.  That language does not sweep in all instances in which the offender\xe2\x80\x99s acts, or another person\xe2\x80\x99s reaction, might result in unintended or negligent harm.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, \xc2\xa716(b) has a temporal limit that the ACCA residual clause lacked: The \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d of force must arise \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Properly interpreted, this means the statute requires a substantial risk that the perpetrator will use force while carrying out the crime.  See <i>Leocal</i>, 543 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe reckless disregard in \xc2\xa716 relates\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The provision thereby excludes more attenuated harms that might arise following the completion of the crime.  The ACCA residual clause, by contrast, contained no similar language restricting its scope.  And the absence of such a limit, coupled with the reference to \xe2\x80\x9cpotential\xe2\x80\x9d risks, gave courts free rein to classify an offense as a violent felony based on injuries that might occur after the offense was over and done.  See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Benton</i>, 639 F.\xc2\xa03d 723, 732 (CA6 2011) (finding that \xe2\x80\x9csolicitation to commit aggravated assault\xe2\x80\x9d qualified under the ACCA residual clause on the theory that the solicited individual might subsequently carry out the requested act).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Why does any of this matter?  Because it mattered in <i>Johnson</i>.  More precisely, the expansive language in the ACCA residual clause contributed to our determination that the clause gave rise to \xe2\x80\x9cgrave uncertainty about how to estimate the risk posed by a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  \xe2\x80\x9cCritically,\xe2\x80\x9d we said\xe2\x80\x94a word that tends to mean something\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<i>picturing the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s behavior is not enough</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  Instead, measuring \xe2\x80\x9cpotential<i> </i>risk\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseemingly require[d] the judge to imagine how the idealized ordinary case of the crime <i>subsequently plays out</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(emphasis added).  Not so here.  In applying \xc2\xa716(b), considering<i> \xe2\x80\x9c</i>the criminal\xe2\x80\x99s behavior\xe2\x80\x9d <i>is</i> enough.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Those three distinctions\xe2\x80\x94the unadorned reference to \xe2\x80\x9crisk,\xe2\x80\x9d the focus on the offender\xe2\x80\x99s own active employment of force, and the \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing\xe2\x80\x9d limitation\xe2\x80\x94also mean that many hard cases under ACCA are easier under \xc2\xa716(b).  Take the firearm possession crime from <i>Johnson </i>itself, which had as its constituent elements (1)\xc2\xa0unlawfully (2)\xc2\xa0possessing (3) a short-barreled shotgun.  None of those elements, \xe2\x80\x9cby its nature,\xe2\x80\x9d carries \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d that the possessor will use force against another \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing inherent in the act of firearm possession, even when it is unlawful, gives rise to a substantial risk that the owner will then shoot someone.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Serafin</i>, 562 F.\xc2\xa03d 1105, 1113 (CA10 2009) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Leocal </i>instructs [a court] to focus not on whether possession will likely <i>result</i> in violence, but instead whether one possessing an unregistered weapon necessarily risks the need to employ force to commit possession\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Yet short-barreled shotgun possession presented a closer question under the ACCA residual clause, because the \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d language seemingly directed us to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances and conduct that ordinarily attend the offense,\xe2\x80\x9d in addition to the offense itself.  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 17); see <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 19\xe2\x80\x9320) (reasoning that the crime must qualify because \xe2\x80\x9ca person who chooses to break the law and risk the heavy criminal penalty incurred by possessing a notoriously dangerous weapon is [likely] to use that weapon in violent ways\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Failure to report to a penal institution, the subject of <i>Chambers </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 122 (2009)\n, is another crime \xe2\x80\x9cwhose treatment becomes more obvious under \xc2\xa716(b) than under ACCA,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 18.

Applying the ACCA residual clause proved more trying.  When asked to decide whether the clause covered drunk driving offenses, a majority of the Court concluded that the answer was no.  <i>Begay</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137 (2008)\n.  Our decision was based, however, on the inference that the clause must cover only \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a test derived not from the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d language, but instead by reference to (what we guessed to be) the unifying characteristics of the enumerated offenses.  <i>Id.,</i> at 144\xe2\x80\x93145.  Four Members of the Court criticized that test, see <i>id.,</i> at 150\xe2\x80\x93153 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 158\xe2\x80\x93160, 162\xe2\x80\x93163 (Alito, J., dissenting), though they themselves disagreed about whether DUIs were covered, see <i>id.,</i> at 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (opinion of Scalia, J.); <i>id.,</i> at 156\xe2\x80\x93158 (opinion of Alito, J.).

The \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d standard in \xc2\xa716(b) is significantly less confusing because it is not tied to a disjointed list of paradigm offenses.  Recall that the ACCA provision defined a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include a crime that \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or <i>otherwise</i> involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  As our Court recognized early on, that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d told the reader to understand the \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d standard by way of the four enumerated crimes.  <i>James</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203.  But how, exactly?  That question dogged our residual clause cases for years, until we said <i>no m\xc3\xa1s</i> in <i>Johnson</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In our first foray, <i>James</i>, we resolved the case by asking whether the risk posed by the crime of attempted burglary was \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable to that posed by its closest analog among the enumerated offenses,\xe2\x80\x9d which was completed burglary.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 203.  While that rule \xe2\x80\x9c[took] care of attempted burglary,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9coffer[ed] no help at all with respect to the vast majority of offenses, which have no apparent analog among the enumerated crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Johnson</i>, 576 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).

But that approach also proved to be harder than it sounded.  See <i>id.,</i> at 219\xe2\x80\x93227.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After <i>James </i>came <i>Begay</i>, in which we concluded that the enumerated offenses served as an independent limitation on the <i>kind </i>of crime that could qualify.  553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 142; see <i>Chambers</i>, 555 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 128 (applying the <i>Begay </i>standard).  As discussed, that test was short lived (though we did not purport to wholly repudiate it).  See <i>Sykes</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 13.  Finally, in <i>Sykes</i>\xe2\x80\x94our penultimate residual clause case\xe2\x80\x94we acknowledged the prior use of the closest-analog test in <i>James</i>, but instead focused on whether the risk posed by vehicular flight was \xe2\x80\x9csimilar in degree of danger\xe2\x80\x9d to the listed offenses of arson and burglary.  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.  As a result, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissent characterized the <i>Sykes </i>majority as applying the test from his prior dissent in <i>James</i>, not <i>James </i>itself.  See<i> </i>564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 29\xe2\x80\x9330, 33.

As <i>Johnson </i>explained, the issue was not that the statute employed a fuzzy standard.

In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s retelling today, the difficulty inhered solely in the fact that the statute paired such a standard with the ordinary case inquiry.  See <i>ante,</i> at 8, 10\xe2\x80\x9311, 21.  But that account sidesteps much of <i>Johnson</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.
