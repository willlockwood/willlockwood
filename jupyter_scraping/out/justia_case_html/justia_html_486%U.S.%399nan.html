The question presented in this case is whether an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides her with a contractual remedy for discharge without just cause may enforce her state law remedy for retaliatory discharge.  The Court of Appeals held that the application of the state tort remedy was preempted by \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 185. 823 F.2d 1031 (CA7 1987) (en banc).

On December 5, 1984, she notified respondent that she had been injured in the course of her employment and requested compensation for her medical expenses pursuant to the Illinois Workers\' Compensation Act.  On December 11, 1984, respondent discharged her for filing a "false worker\'s compensation claim."  <em>Id.</em> at 1033.</p>\n<p>The union representing petitioner promptly filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement that covered all production and maintenance employees in the Herrin plant.  The agreement protected those employees, including petitioner, from discharge except for "proper" or "just" cause, App. 13-14, and established a procedure for the arbitration of grievances, <em>id.</em> at 10-11.  The term grievance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 486 U. S. 402</a></p><p> was broadly defined to encompass</p>\n<p>"any dispute between . . . the Employer and any employee, concerning the effect, interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of this Agreement."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 10.  Ultimately, an arbitrator ruled in petitioner\'s favor and ordered respondent to reinstate her with full backpay.  <em>See id.</em> at 25-26.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, on July 9, 1985, petitioner commenced this action against respondent by filing a complaint in the Illinois Circuit Court for Williamson County, alleging that she had been discharged for exercising her rights under the Illinois workers\' compensation laws.

Respondent removed the case to the Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, and then filed a motion praying that the court either dismiss the case on preemption grounds or stay further proceedings pending the completion of the arbitration.

It concluded that the</p>\n<p>"claim for retaliatory discharge is \'inextricably intertwined\' with the collective bargaining provision prohibiting wrongful discharge or discharge without just cause,"</p>\n<p>and that allowing the state law action to proceed would undermine the arbitration procedures set forth in the parties\' contract.  618 F.Supp. 1448, 1449 (SD Ill.1985).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals agreed that the state law claim was preempted by \xc2\xa7 301.  In an en banc opinion, over the dissent of two judges, it rejected petitioner\'s argument that the tort action was not "inextricably intertwined" with the collective bargaining agreement because the disposition of a retaliatory discharge claim in Illinois does not depend upon an interpretation of the agreement; on the contrary, the court concluded that "the same analysis of the facts" was implicated under both procedures.  823 F.2d at 1046.

We began by examining the collective bargaining agreement, and determined that it provided the basis not only for the benefits, but also for the right to have payments made in a timely manner.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/202/case.html#213">471 U.

We then analyzed the Wisconsin tort remedy, explaining that it</p>\n<p>"exists for breach of a \'duty devolv[ed] upon the insurer by reasonable implication from the express terms of the contract,\' the scope of which, crucially, is \'ascertained from a consideration of the contract itself.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/202/case.html#216">471 U.

Since the</p>\n<p>"parties\' agreement as to the manner in which a benefit claim would be handled [would] necessarily [have been] relevant to any allegation that the claim was handled in a dilatory manner,"</p>\n<p>471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/202/case.html#218">471 U.

[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Illinois courts have recognized the tort of retaliatory discharge for filing a worker\'s compensation claim, <em>Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc.,</em> 74 Ill.2d 172, 384 N.E.2d 353 (1978), [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 486 U.

Miller Chemical Co.,</em> 776 F.2d 1351, 1356 (CA7 1985) (summarizing Illinois state court decisions), <em>cert. denied,</em> 475 U.S. 1122 (1986); <em>see Gonzalez v. Prestress Engineering Corp.,</em> 115 Ill.2d 1, 503 N.E.2d 308 (1986).  Each of these purely factual questions pertains to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer.  Neither of the elements requires a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement.  To defend against a retaliatory discharge claim, an employer must show that it had a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge, <em>cf. Loyola University of Chicago v. Illinois Human Rights Comm\'n,</em> 149 Ill.App.3d 8, 500 N.E.2d 639 (1986); this purely factual inquiry likewise does not turn on the meaning of any provision of a collective bargaining agreement.  Thus, the state law remedy in this case is "independent" of the collective bargaining agreement in the sense of "independent" that matters for \xc2\xa7 301 preemption purposes:  resolution of the state law claim does not require construing the collective bargaining agreement. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 486 U. S. 408</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals seems to have relied upon a different way in which a state law claim may be considered "independent" of a collective bargaining agreement.  The court wrote that "the just cause provision in the collective bargaining agreement may well prohibit such retaliatory discharge," and went on to say that, if the state law cause of action could go forward,</p>\n<p>"a state court would be deciding precisely the <em>same issue</em> as would an arbitrator: whether there was \'just cause\' to discharge the worker."</p>\n<p>823 F.2d at 1046 (emphasis added).  The court concluded,</p>\n<p>"the state tort of retaliatory discharge is inextricably intertwined with the collective bargaining agreements here, because it implicates the <em>same analysis of the facts</em> as would an inquiry under the just cause provisions of the agreements."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  We agree with the Court\'s explanation that the state law analysis might well involve attention to the same factual considerations as the contractual determination of whether Lingle was fired for just cause.  But we disagree with the court\'s conclusion that such parallelism renders the state law analysis dependent upon the contractual analysis.  For, while there may be instances in which the National Labor Relations Act preempts state law on the basis of the subject matter </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 486 U. S. 409</a></p><p> of the law in question, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] \xc2\xa7 301 preemption merely ensures that federal law will be the basis for interpreting collective bargaining agreements, and says nothing about the substantive rights a State may provide to workers when adjudication of those rights does not depend upon the interpretation of such agreements. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  In other words, even if dispute resolution </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 486 U.

In <em>Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html">482 U.

We specifically held that the Maine law in question was not preempted by the NLRA, "since its establishment of a minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective bargaining process."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/1/case.html#23">482 U.

The court distinguished those laws because Congress has affirmatively endorsed state antidiscrimination remedies in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, <em>see</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e-5(c) and 2000e-7, whereas there is no such explicit endorsement of state workers\' compensation laws.  As should be plain from our discussion in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/486/399/case.html#406">486 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> this distinction is unnecessary for determining whether \xc2\xa7 301 preempts the state law in question.  The operation of the antidiscrimination laws does, however, illustrate the relevant point for \xc2\xa7 301 preemption analysis that the mere fact that a broad contractual protection against discriminatory -- or retaliatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="413">Page 486 U. S. 413</a></p><p> -- discharge may provide a remedy for conduct that coincidentally violates state law does not make the existence or the contours of the state law violation dependent upon the terms of the private contract.  For even if an arbitrator should conclude that the contract does not prohibit a particular discriminatory or retaliatory discharge, that conclusion might or might not be consistent with a proper interpretation of state law.  In the typical case, a state tribunal could resolve either a discriminatory or retaliatory discharge claim without interpreting the "just cause" language of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n<p>In sum, we hold that an application of state law is preempted by \xc2\xa7 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 only if such application requires the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement.

Lincoln Mills,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/353/448/case.html">353 U. S. 448</a></span>, requires the federal courts to fashion, from the policy of our national labor laws, a body of federal law for the enforcement of collective bargaining agreements, nonetheless, the courts of the States remain free to apply individualized local rules when called upon to enforce such agreements.  This view cannot be accepted.  The dimensions of \xc2\xa7 301 require the conclusion that substantive principles of federal labor law must be paramount in the area covered by the statute.  Comprehensiveness is inherent in the process by which the law is to be formulated under the mandate of <em>Lincoln Mills,</em> requiring issues raised in suits of a kind covered by \xc2\xa7 301 to be decided according to the precepts of federal labor policy."</p>\n<p>"More important, the subject matter of \xc2\xa7 301(a) \'is peculiarly one that calls for uniform law.\' . . .  The possibility that individual contract terms might have different meanings under state and federal law would inevitably exert a disruptive influence upon both the negotiation and administration of collective agreements.  Because neither party could be certain of the rights which it had obtained or conceded, the process of negotiating an agreement would be made immeasurably more difficult by the necessity of trying to formulate contract provisions in such a way as to contain the same meaning under two or more systems of law which might someday be invoked in enforcing the contract.  Once the collective bargain was made, the possibility of conflicting substantive interpretation under competing legal systems would tend to stimulate and prolong disputes as to its interpretation.  Indeed, the existence of possibly conflicting legal concepts might substantially impede the parties\' willingness to agree to contract terms providing for final arbitral or judicial resolution of disputes."</p>\n<p>"The importance of the area which would be affected by separate systems of substantive law makes the need for a single body of federal law particularly compelling.  The ordering and adjusting of competing interests through a process of free and voluntary collective bargaining is the keystone of the federal scheme to promote industrial peace.  State law which frustrates the effort of Congress to stimulate the smooth functioning of that process thus strikes at the very core of federal labor policy.  With due regard to the many factors which bear upon competing state and federal interests in this area, . . . we cannot but conclude that, in enacting \xc2\xa7 301, Congress intended doctrines of federal labor law uniformly to prevail over inconsistent local rules."</p>\n<p>369 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/369/95/case.html#103">369 U.

Not so here.</p>\n<p>Petitioner points to the fact that the Illinois right to be free from retaliatory discharge is nonnegotiable, and applies to unionized and nonunionized workers alike.  While it may be true that most state laws that are not preempted by \xc2\xa7 301 will grant nonnegotiable rights that are shared by all state workers, we note that neither condition ensures nonpreemption.  It is conceivable that a State could create a remedy that, although nonnegotiable, nonetheless turned on the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement for its application.  Such a remedy would be preempted by \xc2\xa7 301.  Similarly, if a law applied to all state workers, but required, at least in certain instances, collective bargaining agreement interpretation, the application of the law in those instances would be preempted.  Conversely, a law could cover only unionized workers, but remain unpreempted if no collective bargaining agreement interpretation was needed to resolve claims brought thereunder.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Although \xc2\xa7 301 preempts state law only insofar as resolution of the state law claim requires the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, and although \xc2\xa7 301 preemption is all that is at issue in this case, it is important to remember that other federal labor law principles may preempt state law.  Thus, in <em>San Diego Building Trades Council v. Garmon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/case.html">359 U.

Although federal law would govern the interpretation of the agreement to determine the proper damages, the underlying state law claim, not otherwise preempted, would stand.
