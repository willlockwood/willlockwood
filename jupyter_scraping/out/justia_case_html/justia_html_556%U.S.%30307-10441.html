At 3:30 p.m. he was taken from the hospital to the local FBI office and told that he was a suspect in a bank robbery.  Though the office was in the same building as the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not bring him before a magistrate judge, but questioned him, hoping for a confession.  At 5:27 p.m., some 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral confession that he robbed the bank.  He asked for a break at 6:30 and was held overnight.  The interrogation resumed the next morning, ending with his signed written confession.  He was finally presented to a Magistrate Judge at 1:30 p.m., 29.5 hours after his arrest, and charged with armed bank robbery and related charges.  The District Court denied his motion to suppress his confessions under Rule 5(a) and <em>McNabb-Mallory.  </em>It reasoned that the oral confession occurred within \xc2\xa73501(c)\xe2\x80\x99s six-hour window because the time of Corley\xe2\x80\x99s medical treatment should be excluded from the delay.  It also found the written confession admissible, explaining there was no unreasonable delay under Rule 5(a) because Corley had requested the break.  He was convicted of conspiracy and bank robbery.  The Third Circuit affirmed.  Relying on Circuit precedent to the effect that \xc2\xa73501 abrogated <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> and replaced it with a pure voluntariness test, it concluded that if a district court found a confession voluntary after considering the points listed in \xc2\xa73501(b), it would be admissible, even if the presentment delay was unreasonable.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Section 3501 modified <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> but did not supplant it.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Government claims that because \xc2\xa73501(a) makes a confession \xe2\x80\x9cadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cif it is voluntarily given,\xe2\x80\x9d it entirely eliminates <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> with its bar to admitting even a voluntary confession if given during an unreasonable presentment delay.  Corley argues that \xc2\xa73501(a) was only meant to overrule <em>Miranda,</em> and notes that only \xc2\xa73501(c) touches on <em>McNabb-Mallory,</em> making the rule inapplicable to confessions given within six hours of an arrest.  He has the better argument.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9316.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading renders \xc2\xa73501(c) nonsensical and superfluous.  If subsection (a) really meant that any voluntary confession was admissible, then subsection (c) would add nothing; if a confession was \xe2\x80\x9cmade voluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d it would be admissible, period, and never \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible solely because of delay,\xe2\x80\x9d even a delay beyond six hours.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading is thus at odds with the basic interpretive canon that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] statute should be construed [to give effect] to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U. S. 88</a>, 101.  The Government claims that in providing that a confession \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be admissible,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress meant that a confession \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be [involuntary].\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus read, (c) would specify a bright-line rule applying (a) to cases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does not make a confession involuntary unless the delay exceeds six hours.  But \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress did not write the statute that way.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23.  The terms \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d are not synonymous.  Congress used both in (c), and this Court \xe2\x80\x9cwould not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  There is also every reason to believe that Congress used the distinct terms deliberately, specifying two criteria that must be satisfied to prevent a confession from being \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible solely because of delay\xe2\x80\x9d: the confession must be \xe2\x80\x9c[1] made voluntarily and \xe2\x80\xa6 [2] within six hours [of arrest].\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, under the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule, \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d mean different things.  Corley\xe2\x80\x99s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and (a), by reading (a) as overruling <em>Miranda</em> and (c) as qualifying <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s counterargument\xe2\x80\x94that Corley\xe2\x80\x99s reading would also create a conflict, since (a) makes all voluntary confessions admissible while (c) would leave some voluntary confessions inadmissible\xe2\x80\x94falls short.  First, (a) is a broad directive while (c) aims only at <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, and \xe2\x80\x9ca more specific statute [is] given precedence over a more general one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Busic</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/398/index.html">446 U. S. 398</a>, 406.  Second, reading (a) to create a conflict with (c) not only would make (c) superfluous, but would also create conflicts with so many other Rules of Evidence that the subsection cannot possibly be given its literal scope.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The legislative history strongly favors Corley\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  The Government points to nothing in this history supporting its contrary view.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s position would leave the Rule 5 presentment requirement without teeth, for if there is no <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> there is no apparent remedy for a presentment delay.  The prompt presentment requirement is not just an administrative nicety.  It dates back to the common law.  Under Rule 5, presentment is the point at which the judge must take several key steps to foreclose Government overreaching: <em>e.g., </em>informing the defendant of the charges against him and giving the defendant a chance to consult with counsel.  Without <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, federal agents would be free to question suspects for extended periods before bringing them out in the open, even though \xe2\x80\x9ccustodial police interrogation, by its very nature, isolates and pressures the individual,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 435, inducing people to confess to crimes they never committed.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0There is no merit to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fallback claim that even if \xc2\xa73501 preserved a limited version of <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, Congress cut it out by enacting Federal Rule of Evidence 402, which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United States, by Act of Congress, by these rules, or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Notes expressly identified <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> as a statutorily authorized rule that would survive Rule 402, and the Government has previously conceded before this Court that Rule 402 preserved <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.

S. 449</a> (1957), under which an arrested person\xe2\x80\x99s confession is inadmissible if given after an unreasonable delay in bringing him before a judge.  We hold that Congress meant to limit, not eliminate, <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his prisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably could.  See <em>County of Riverside</em> v. <em>McLaughlin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/44/index.html">500 U. S. 44</a>, 61\xe2\x80\x9362 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  This \xe2\x80\x9cpresentment\xe2\x80\x9d requirement tended to prevent secret detention and served to inform a suspect of the charges against him, and it was the law in nearly every American State and the National Government.  See <em>id.</em>, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361; <em>McNabb</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 342, and n.\xc2\xa07. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>McNabb</em> v. <em>United States</em> raised the question of how to enforce a number of federal statutes codifying the presentment rule.  318 U. S., at 342 (citing, among others, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7595 (1940 ed.), which provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t shall be the duty of the marshal \xe2\x80\xa6 who may arrest a person \xe2\x80\xa6 to take the defendant before the nearest \xe2\x80\xa6 judicial officer \xe2\x80\xa6 for a hearing\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  There, federal agents flouted the requirement by interrogating several murder suspects for days before bringing them before a magistrate, and then only after they had given the confessions that convicted them.  318 U. S., at 334\xe2\x80\x93338, 344\xe2\x80\x93345.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motions to exclude the confessions from evidence, we saw no need to reach any constitutional issue.  Instead we invoked the supervisory power to establish and maintain \xe2\x80\x9ccivilized standards of procedure and evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in federal courts, <em>id.</em>, at 340, which we exercised for the sake of making good on the traditional obligation embodied in the federal presentment legislation.  We saw both the statutes and the traditional rule as aimed not only at checking the likelihood of resort to the third degree but meant generally to \xe2\x80\x9cavoid all the evil implications of secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 344.  We acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress ha[d] not explicitly forbidden the use of evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 procured\xe2\x80\x9d in derogation of the presentment obligation, <em>id.</em>, at 345, but we realized that \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[ting] such evidence to be made the basis of a conviction in the federal courts would stultify the policy which Congress ha[d] enacted into law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and in the exercise of supervisory authority we held confessions inadmissible when obtained during unreasonable presentment delay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after <em>McNabb</em>, the combined action of the Judicial Conference of the United States and Congress produced Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a), which pulled the several statutory presentment provisions together in one place.  See <em>Mallory</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 452 (describing Rule 5(a) as \xe2\x80\x9ca compendious restatement, without substantive change, of several prior specific federal statutory provisions\xe2\x80\x9d).  As first enacted, the rule told \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n officer making an arrest under a warrant issued upon a complaint or any person making an arrest without a warrant [to] take the arrested person without unnecessary delay before the nearest available commissioner or before any other nearby officer empowered to commit persons charged with offenses against the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa05(a) (1946).  The rule remains much the same today: \xe2\x80\x9cA person making an arrest within the United States must take the defendant without unnecessary delay before a magistrate judge \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa05(a)(1)(A) (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A case for applying <em>McNabb</em> and Rule 5(a) together soon arose in <em>Upshaw</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/335/410/index.html">335 U. S. 410</a> (1948).  Despite the Government\xe2\x80\x99s confession of error, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit had thought <em>McNabb</em>\xe2\x80\x99s exclusionary rule applied only to involuntary confessions obtained by coercion during the period of delay, 335 U. S., at 411\xe2\x80\x93412, and so held the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary confession admissible into evidence<em>.</em>  This was error, and we reiterated the reasoning of a few years earlier.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the <em>McNabb</em> case we held that the plain purpose of the requirement that prisoners should promptly be taken before committing magistrates was to check resort by officers to \xe2\x80\x98secret interrogation of persons accused of crime.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 412 (quoting <em>McNabb</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 344).  <em>Upshaw</em> consequently emphasized that even voluntary confessions are inadmissible if given after an unreasonable delay in presentment.  335 U. S., at 413.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We applied Rule 5(a) again in <em>Mallory</em> v. <em>United States</em>, holding a confession given seven hours after arrest inadmissible for \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary delay\xe2\x80\x9d in presenting the suspect to a magistrate, where the police questioned the suspect for hours \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the vicinity of numerous committing magistrates.\xe2\x80\x9d  354 U. S., at 455.  Again, we repeated the reasons for the rule and explained, as we had before and have since, that delay for the purpose of interrogation is the epitome of \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 455\xe2\x80\x93456; see also <em>McLaughlin</em>, 500 U. S., at 61 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was clear\xe2\x80\x9d at common law \xe2\x80\x9cthat the only element bearing upon the reasonableness of delay was not such circumstances as the pressing need to conduct further investigation, but the arresting officer\xe2\x80\x99s ability, once the prisoner had been secured, to reach a magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Upshaw</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 414.  Thus, the rule known simply as <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally render[s] inadmissible confessions made during periods of detention that violat[e] the prompt presentment requirement of Rule 5(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/350/index.html"></a><a href="/us/511/350/index.html">511 U.

After federal agents learned that Corley was subject to arrest on an unrelated local matter, some federal and state officers went together to execute the state warrant on September 17, 2003, and found him just as he was pulling out of a driveway in his car.  Corley nearly ran over one officer, then jumped out of the car, pushed the officer down, and ran.  The agents gave chase and caught and arrested him for assaulting a federal officer.

Around 11:45 a.m. they took him to a Philadelphia hospital to treat a minor cut on his hand that he got during the chase.  At 3:30 p.m. the agents took him from the hospital to the Philadelphia FBI office and told him that he was a suspect in the Norristown bank robbery.  Though the office was in the same building as the chambers of the nearest magistrate judges, the agents did not bring Corley before a magistrate, but questioned him instead, in hopes of getting a confession.

At 5:27 p.m., some 9.5 hours after his arrest, Corley began an oral confession that he robbed the bank, <em>id.</em>, at 62, and spoke on in this vein until about 6:30, when agents asked him to put it all in writing.  Corley said he was tired and wanted a break, so the agents decided to hold him overnight and take the written statement the next morning.  At 10:30 a.m. on September 18 they began the interrogation again, which ended when Corley signed a written confession.  He was finally presented to a magistrate at 1:30 p.m. that day, 29.5 hours after his arrest.  500 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 212.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corley was charged with armed bank robbery, 18 U.

When he moved to suppress his oral and written confessions under Rule 5(a) and <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, the District Court denied the motion, with the explanation that the time Corley was receiving medical treatment should be excluded from the delay, and that the oral confession was thus given within the six-hour window of \xc2\xa73501(c).

The panel majority considered itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that \xc2\xa73501 entirely abrogated the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule and replaced it with a pure voluntariness test.

Subsection (c) provides that a confession \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be inadmissible solely because of delay\xe2\x80\x9d in presentment if the confession is \xe2\x80\x9cmade voluntarily and . . . within six hours [of arrest].\xe2\x80\x9d  If (a) really meant that any voluntary confession was admissible, as the Government contends, then (c) would add nothing; if a confession was \xe2\x80\x9cmade voluntarily\xe2\x80\x9d it would be admissible, period, and never \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible solely because of delay,\xe2\x80\x9d no matter whether the delay went beyond six hours.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress never needed (c); (c) in the [G]overnment\xe2\x80\x99s view was always superfluous\xe2\x80\x9d). </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading is thus at odds with one of the most basic interpretive canons, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a] statute should be construed so that effect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/88/index.html">542 U.

[made] within six hours [of arrest].\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus rewritten, (c) would coexist peacefully (albeit inelegantly) with (a), with (c) simply specifying a bright-line rule applying (a) to cases of delay: it would tell courts that delay alone does not make a confession involuntary unless the delay exceeds six hours.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To this proposal, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he short answer is that Congress did not write the statute that way.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U.

The Government may say that we can sensibly read \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d because the words are \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually synonymous \xe2\x80\xa6 in this statutory context,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 23, but this is simply not so.  To begin with, Congress used both terms in (c) itself, and \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e would not presume to ascribe this difference to a simple mistake in draftsmanship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 23.  And there is, in fact, every reason to believe that Congress used the distinct terms very deliberately.  Subsection (c) specifies two criteria that must be satisfied to prevent a confession from being \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible solely because of delay\xe2\x80\x9d: the confession must be \xe2\x80\x9c[1] made voluntarily and \xe2\x80\xa6 [2] within six hours [of arrest].\xe2\x80\x9d  Because voluntariness is thus only one of several criteria for admissibility under (c), \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d plainly cannot be synonymous.  What is more, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument ignores the fact that under the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule, which we presume Congress was aware of, <em>Cannon</em> v. <em>University of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/677/index.html">441 U. S. 677</a>, 699 (1979), \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d mean different things.  As we explained before and as the Government concedes, <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> makes even voluntary confessions inadmissible if given after an unreasonable delay in presentment, <em>Upshaw</em>, 335 U. S., at 413; Tr. of Oral Arg. 33 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was well understood that <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 excluded totally voluntary confessions\xe2\x80\x9d).  So we cannot accept the Government\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to confuse the critically distinct terms \xe2\x80\x9cinvoluntary\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d by rewriting (c) into a bright-line rule doing nothing more than applying (a). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Corley\xe2\x80\x99s position, in contrast, gives effect to both (c) and (a), by reading (a) as overruling <em>Miranda</em> and (c) as qualifying <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.  The Government answers, however, that accepting Corley\xe2\x80\x99s argument would result in a different problem: it would create a conflict between (c) and (a), since (a) provides that all voluntary confessions are admissible while Corley\xe2\x80\x99s reading of (c) leaves some voluntary confessions inadmissible.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s counterargument falls short for two reasons.  First, even if (a) is read to be at odds with (c), the conflict is resolved by recognizing that (a) is a broad directive while (c) aims only at <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, and \xe2\x80\x9ca more specific statute will be given precedence over a more general one \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Busic</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/398/index.html">446 U. S. 398</a>, 406 (1980).  Second, and more fundamentally, (a) cannot prudently be read to create a conflict with (c), not only because it would make (c) superfluous, as explained, but simply because reading (a) that way would create conflicts with so many other rules that the subsection cannot possibly be given its literal scope.  Subsection (a) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any criminal prosecution brought by the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, a confession \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa73501(e) defines \xe2\x80\x9cconfession\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany confession of guilt of any criminal offense or any self-incriminating statement made or given orally or in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, if the Government seriously urged a literal reading, (a) would mean that \xe2\x80\x9cin any criminal prosecution brought by the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, [\xe2\x80\x98any self-incriminating statement\xe2\x80\x99 with respect to \xe2\x80\x98any criminal offense\xe2\x80\x99] \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be admissible in evidence if it is voluntarily given.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus would many a Rule of Evidence be overridden in case after case: a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s self-incriminating statement to his lawyer would be admissible despite his insistence on attorney-client privilege; a fourth-hand hearsay statement the defendant allegedly made would come in; and a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s confession to an entirely unrelated crime committed years earlier would be admissible without more.  These are some of the absurdities of literalism that show that Congress could not have been writing in a literalistic frame of mind.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As it turns out, there is more than <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> and the antisuperfluousness canon to confirm that subsection (a) leaves <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> alone, for that is what legislative history says.  In fact, the Government concedes that subsections (a) and (b) were aimed at <em>Miranda</em>, while subsection (c) was meant to modify the presentment exclusionary rule.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 38 (\xe2\x80\x9cI will concede to you \xe2\x80\xa6 that section (a) was considered to overrule <em>Miranda</em>, and subsection (c) was addressed to <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  The concession is unavoidable.  The Senate, where \xc2\xa73501 originated, split the provision into two parts: Division 1 contained subsections (a) and (b), and Division 2 contained subsection (c).  114 Cong. Rec. 14171 (1968).  In the debate on the Senate floor immediately before voting on these proposals, several Senators, including the section\xe2\x80\x99s prime sponsor, Senator McClellan, explained that Division 1 \xe2\x80\x9chas to do with the <em>Miranda</em> decision,\xe2\x80\x9d while Division 2 related to <em>Mallory</em>.  114 Cong. Rec. 14171\xe2\x80\x9314172.  This distinct intent was confirmed by the separate Senate votes adopting the two measures, Division 1 by 55 to 29 and Division 2 by 58 to 26, <em>id.</em>, at 14171\xe2\x80\x9314172, 14174\xe2\x80\x9314175; if (a) did abrogate <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, as the Government claims, then voting for Division 2 would have been entirely superfluous, for the Division 1 vote would already have done the job.  That aside, a sponsor\xe2\x80\x99s statement to the full Senate carries considerable weight, and Senator McClellan\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that Division 1 was specifically addressed to <em>Miranda</em> confirms that (a) and (b) were never meant to reach far enough to abrogate other background evidentiary rules including <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further legislative history not only drives that point home, but conclusively shows an intent that subsection (c) limit <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>, not replace it.  In its original draft, subsection (c) would indeed have done away with <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> completely, for the bill as first written would have provided that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any criminal prosecution by the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, a confession made or given by a person who is a defendant therein \xe2\x80\xa6 shall not be inadmissible solely because of delay in bringing such person before a [magistrate] if such confession is \xe2\x80\xa6 made voluntarily.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. 917, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (1968) (as reported by Senate Committee on the Judiciary); 114 Cong. Rec. 14172.  The provision so conceived was resisted, however, by a number of Senators worried about allowing indefinite presentment delays.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 11740, 13990 (Sen. Tydings) (the provision would \xe2\x80\x9cpermit Federal criminal suspects to be questioned indefinitely before they are presented to a committing magistrate\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 12290 (Sen. Fong) (the provision \xe2\x80\x9cwould open the doors to such practices as holding suspects incommunicado for an indefinite period\xe2\x80\x9d).  After Senator Tydings proposed striking (c) from the bill altogether, <em>id.</em>, at 13651 (Amendment No. 788), Senator Scott introduced the compromise of qualifying (c) with the words: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98and if such confession was made or given by such person within six hours following his arrest or other detention.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 14184\xe2\x80\x9314185 (Amendment No. 805).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The amendment was intended to confine <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> to excluding only confessions given after more than six hours of delay, see 114 Cong.

Crime Act), \xc2\xa7301(b), 81 Stat. 735\xe2\x80\x93736, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 114 Cong. Rec. 14184 (remarks of Sen.

By the terms of that Act, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny statement, admission, or confession made by an arrested person within three hours immediately following his arrest shall not be excluded from evidence in the courts of the District of Columbia solely because of delay in presentment.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7301(b), 81 Stat. 735\xe2\x80\x93736.

Tr. of Oral Arg. 25.  One might not care if the prompt presentment requirement were just some administrative nicety, but in fact the rule has always mattered in very practical ways and still does.

According to the Court, this rule survived the enactment of \xc2\xa73501(a) because Congress adopted that provision for the sole purpose of abrogating <em>Miranda</em> and apparently never realized that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s broad language would also do away with the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule.  I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and therefore respectfully dissent. </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s first and most substantial argument invokes \xe2\x80\x9cthe antisuperfluousness canon,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 12, under which a statute should be read, if possible, so that all of its provisions are given effect and none is superfluous.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9312.  Section 3501(c) provides that a voluntary confession \xe2\x80\x9cshall not be inadmissible solely because of the delay\xe2\x80\x9d in bringing the defendant before a judicial officer if the defendant is brought before a judicial officer within six hours of arrest.  If \xc2\xa73501(a) means that a voluntary confession may never be excluded due to delay in bringing the defendant before a judicial officer, the Court reasons, then \xc2\xa73501(c), which provides a safe harbor for a subset of voluntary confessions (those made in cases in which the initial appearance occurs within six hours of arrest), is superfluous.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Canons of interpretation \xe2\x80\x9care quite often useful in close cases, or when statutory language is ambiguous.  But we have observed before that such \xe2\x80\x98interpretative canon[s are] not a license for the judiciary to rewrite language enacted by the legislature.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Monsanto</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/600/index.html">491 U.

Like other canons, the antisuperfluousness canon is merely an interpretive aid, not an absolute rule.  See <em>Connecticut Nat. Bank</em>,<em> </em>503 U. S., at 254 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the words of a statute are unambiguous, then, this first canon is also the last: \xe2\x80\x98judicial inquiry is complete\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  There are times when Congress enacts provisions that are superfluous, and this may be such an instance.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 253 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]edundancies across statutes are not unusual events in drafting\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Gutierrez de Martinez</em> v. <em>Lamagno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/417/index.html">515 U. S. 417</a>, 445\xe2\x80\x93446 (1995) (Souter, J., dissenting) (noting that, although Congress \xe2\x80\x9cindulged in a little redundancy,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cinelegance may be forgiven\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cCongress could sensibly have seen some practical value in the redundancy\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, any superfluity created by giving subsection (a) its plain meaning may be minimized by interpreting subsection (c) to apply to confessions that are otherwise voluntary.  The Government contends that \xc2\xa73501(c), though inartfully drafted, is not superfluous because what the provision means is that a confession is admissible if it is given within six hours of arrest and it is <em>otherwise</em> voluntary\xe2\x80\x94that is, if there is no basis other than prepresentment delay for concluding that the confession was coerced.  Read in this way, \xc2\xa73501(c) is not superfluous.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rejects this argument on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress did not write the statute that way,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, and thus, in order to adhere to a narrow reading of \xc2\xa73501(c), the Court entirely disregards the unambiguous language of \xc2\xa73501(a).  Although \xc2\xa73501(a) says that a confession is admissible if it is \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily given,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reads that provision to mean that a voluntary confession may not be excluded on the ground that the confession was obtained in violation of <em>Miranda</em>.  To this reading, the short answer is that Congress <em>really</em> did not write the statute that way.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As is true with most of the statutory interpretation questions that come before this Court, the question in this case is not like a jigsaw puzzle.  There is simply no perfect solution to the problem before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, we must choose between two imperfect solutions.  The first (the one adopted by the Court) entirely disregards the clear and simple language of \xc2\xa73501(a), rests on the proposition that Congress did not understand the plain import of the language it used in subsection (a), but adheres to a strictly literal interpretation of \xc2\xa73501(c).  The second option respects the clear language of subsection (a), but either accepts some statutory surplusage or interprets \xc2\xa73501(c)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to a voluntary confession to mean an otherwise voluntary confession.  To my mind, the latter choice is far preferable.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the antisuperfluousness canon, the Court relies on the canon that favors a specific statutory provision over a conflicting provision cast in more general terms, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 11, but that canon is inapplicable here.  For one thing, \xc2\xa73501(a) is quite specific; it specifically provides that if a confession is voluntary, it is admissible.  More important, there is no other provision, specific or general, that conflicts with \xc2\xa73501(a).  See <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>Gulf Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/327/index.html">534 U. S. 327</a>, 335\xe2\x80\x93336 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that specific statutory language should control more general language <em>when there is a conflict between the two</em>.  Here, however, there is no conflict\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Subsection (c) is not conflicting because it does not authorize the suppression of any voluntary confession.  What the Court identifies is not a conflict between two statutory provisions but a conflict between the express language of one provision (\xc2\xa73501(a)) and the \xe2\x80\x9cnegative implication\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court draws from another (\xc2\xa73501(c)).  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Alvarez-Sanchez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/350/index.html">511 U. S. 350</a>, 355 (1994).  Because \xc2\xa73501(c) precludes the suppression of a voluntary confession based solely on a delay of less than six hours, the Court infers that Congress must have contemplated that a voluntary confession could be suppressed based solely on a delay of more than six hours.  The Court cites no authority for a canon of interpretation that favors a \xe2\x80\x9cnegative implication\xe2\x80\x9d of this sort over clear and express statutory language. </p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends that a literal interpretation of \xc2\xa73501(a) would leave the prompt presentment requirement set out in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 5(a)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cwithout any teeth, for \xe2\x80\xa6 if there is no <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> there is no apparent remedy for delay in presentment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>,<em> </em>at 15.  There is nothing strange, however, about a prompt presentment requirement that is not enforced by a rule excluding voluntary confessions made during a period of excessive prepresentment delay.  As the Court notes, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he common law obliged an arresting officer to bring his prisoner before a magistrate as soon as he reasonably could,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 1, but the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> supervisory rule was not adopted until the middle of the 20th century.  To this day, while the States are required by the Fourth Amendment to bring an arrestee promptly before a judicial officer, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Riverside</em> v.<em> McLaughlin</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/44/index.html">500 U. S. 44</a>, 56 (1991), we have never held that this constitutional requirement is backed by an automatic exclusionary sanction, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/586/index.html">547 U. S. 586</a>, 592 (2006).  And although the prompt presentment requirement serves interests in addition to the prevention of coerced confessions, the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule provides no sanction for excessive prepresentment delay in those instances in which no confession is sought or obtained.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the need for the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> exclusionary rule is no longer clear.  That rule, which was adopted long before <em>Miranda</em>, originally served a purpose that is now addressed by the giving of <em>Miranda</em> warnings upon arrest.  As <em>Miranda</em> recognized, <em>McNabb</em> and <em>Mallory</em> were \xe2\x80\x9cresponsive to the same considerations of Fifth Amendment policy\xe2\x80\x9d that the <em>Miranda</em> rule was devised to address.  <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, 463 (1966).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the pre-<em>Miranda</em> era, the requirement of prompt presentment ensured that persons taken into custody would, within a relatively short period, receive advice about their rights.  See <em>McNabb</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/332/index.html"></a><a href="/us/318/332/index.html">318 U. S. 332</a>, 344 (1943).  Now, however, <em>Miranda</em> ensures that arrestees receive such advice at an even earlier point, within moments of being taken into custody.  Of course, arrestees, after receiving <em>Miranda</em> warnings, may waive their rights and submit to questioning by law enforcement officers, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Davis</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/452/index.html">512 U. S. 452</a>, 458 (1994), and arrestees may likewise waive the prompt presentment requirement, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>New York </em>v. <em>Hill</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/110/index.html">528 U. S. 110</a>, 114 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98in the context of a broad array of constitutional and statutory provisions,\xe2\x80\x99 articulated a general rule that presumes the availability of waiver, \xe2\x80\xa6 and we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x98the most basic rights of criminal defendants are \xe2\x80\xa6 subject to waiver\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  It seems unlikely that many arrestees who are willing to waive the right to remain silent and the right to the assistance of counsel during questioning would balk at waiving the right to prompt presentment.  More than a few courts of appeals have gone as far as to hold that a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights also constitutes a waiver under <em>McNabb-Mallory</em>.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salamanca</em>, 990 F.\xc2\xa02d 629, 634 (CADC), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/928/index.html">510 U.

S. 827</a> (1969).  Whether or not those decisions are correct, it is certainly not clear that the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule adds much protection beyond that provided by <em>Miranda</em>.  </p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court contends that the legislative history of \xc2\xa73501 supports its interpretation<em>, </em>but the legislative history proves nothing that is not evident from the terms of the statute.  With respect to \xc2\xa73501(a), the legislative history certainly shows that the provision\xe2\x80\x99s chief backers meant to do away with <em>Miranda</em>,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] but the Court cites no evidence that this was all that \xc2\xa73501(a) was intended to accomplish.  To the contrary, the Senate Report clearly says that \xc2\xa73501(a) was meant to reinstate the traditional rule that a confession should be excluded only if involuntary, see S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 1097, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 38 (1968) (Senate Report), a step that obviously has consequences beyond the elimination of <em>Miranda</em>.  And the Senate Report repeatedly cited <em>Escobedo</em> v.<em> Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U. S. 478</a> (1964), as an example of an unsound limitation on the admission of voluntary confessions, see Senate Report 41\xe2\x80\x9351, thus illustrating that \xc2\xa73501(a) was not understood as simply an anti-<em>Miranda </em>provision.  Whether a majority of the Members of the House and Senate had the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule specifically in mind when they voted for \xc2\xa73501(a) is immaterial.  Statutory provisions may often have a reach that is broader than the specific targets that the lawmakers might have had in mind at the time of enactment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative history relating to \xc2\xa73501(c) suggests nothing more than that <em>some Members</em> of Congress may mistakenly have thought that the version of \xc2\xa73501 that was finally adopted would not displace the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule.  As the Court relates, the version of \xc2\xa73501(c) that emerged from the Senate Judiciary Committee would have completely eliminated that rule.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  Some Senators opposed this, and the version of this provision that was eventually passed simply trimmed the rule.  It is possible to identify a few Senators who spoke out in opposition to the earlier version of subsection\xc2\xa0(c) and then voted in favor of the version that eventually passed, and it is fair to infer that these Senators likely thought that the amendment of subsection (c) had saved the rule.  See 114 Cong. Rec. 14172\xe2\x80\x9314175, 14798 (1968).  But there is no evidence that a majority of the House and Senate shared that view, and any Member who took a few moments to read subsections (a) and (c) must readily have understood that subsection (a) would wipe away all non&amp;nbhyph;constitutionally based rules barring the admission of voluntary confessions, not just <em>Miranda</em>, and that subsection (c) did not authorize the suppression of any voluntary confessions.  The Court unjustifiably attributes to a majority of the House and Senate a mistake that, the legislative history suggests, may have been made by only a few.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court argues that under a literal reading of \xc2\xa73501(a), \xe2\x80\x9cmany a rule of evidence [would] be overridden in case after case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  In order to avoid this absurd result, the Court says, it is necessary to read \xc2\xa73501(a) as merely abrogating <em>Miranda</em> and not\nthe <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule.  There is no merit to this\nargument.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language that Congress used in \xc2\xa73501(a)\xe2\x80\x94a confession is \xe2\x80\x9cadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily given\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is virtually a verbatim quotation of the language used by this Court in describing the traditional rule regarding the admission of confessions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Haynes</em> v. <em>Washington</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/503/index.html">373 U. S. 503</a>, 513 (1963) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0In short, the true test of admissibility is that the confession is made freely, voluntarily and without compulsion or inducement of any sort.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/162/613/index.html">162 U. S. 613</a>, 623 (1896))); <em>Lyons</em> v.<em> Oklahoma</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/596/index.html">322 U. S. 596</a>, 602 (1944); <em>Ziang Sung Wan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/1/index.html">266 U. S. 1</a>, 15 (1924); <em>Bram</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/168/532/index.html">168 U. S. 532</a>, 545 (1897).  In making these statements, this Court certainly did not mean to suggest that a voluntary confession must be admitted in those instances in which a standard rule of evidence would preclude admission, and there is no reason to suppose that Congress meant any such thing either.  In any event, the Federal Rules of Evidence now make it clear that \xc2\xa73501(a) does not supersede ordinary evidence Rules, including Rules regarding privilege (Rule 501), hearsay (Rule 802), and restrictions on the use of character evidence (Rule 404).  Thus, it is not necessary to disregard the plain language of \xc2\xa73501(a), as the Court does, in order to avoid the sort of absurd results to which the Court refers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.

It is apparent that the attorney for the Government chose his words carefully and did not concede, as the Court seems to suggest, that subsection (a) was intended to do no more than to overrule <em>Miranda</em> or that subsection (c) was the only part of \xc2\xa73501 that affected the <em>McNabb-Mallory</em> rule.  </p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, cases in which one of the standard Rules of Evidence might block the admission of a voluntary confession would seem quite rare, and the Court cites no real-world examples.
