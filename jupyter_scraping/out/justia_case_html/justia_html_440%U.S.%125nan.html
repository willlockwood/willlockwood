JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>At issue in this appeal is whether Illinois may exclude from its Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care program children who reside with relatives.</p>\n<p>The Aid to Families with Dependent Children-Foster Care program (AFDC-FC) authorizes federal financial subsidies </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 440 U. S. 127</a></p><p> for the care and support of children removed from their homes and made wards of the State pursuant to a judicial determination that the children\'s homes were not conducive to their welfare.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 408(a)(1), (2) of the Social Security Act of 135 (Act), as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 608(a)(1), (2). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  To </p><p><a class="page-number" name="128">Page 440 U. S. 128</a></p><p> qualify for Foster Care assistance, these children must be placed in a "foster family home or child care institution." \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a)(3). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The basic AFDC program, already in existence when the Foster Care program was enacted in 1961, provides aid to eligible children who live with a parent or with a relative specified in \xc2\xa7 406(a) of the Act. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In administering these programs, Illinois distinguishes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 440 U. S. 129</a></p><p> between related and unrelated foster parents.  Children placed in unrelated foster homes may participate in the AFDC-FC program.  But those who are placed in the homes of relatives listed in \xc2\xa7 406(a), and who are entitled to basic AFDC benefits, cannot receive AFDC-FC assistance because the State defines the term "foster family home" as a facility for children unrelated to the operator. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Foster children living with relatives may participate only in Illinois\' basic AFDC program, which provides lower monthly payments than the Foster Care program. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The specific question presented here is whether Illinois has correctly interpreted the federal standards for AFDC-FC eligibility set forth in \xc2\xa7 408(a) of the Act to exclude children who, because of placement with related, rather than unrelated, foster parents qualify for assistance under the basic AFDC program.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellees are four foster children, their older sister (Linda Youakim), and her husband (Marcel Youakim).  In 1969, Illinois removed the children from their mother\'s home and made them wards of the State following a judicial determination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 440 U. S. 130</a></p><p> of neglect.  The Department of Children and Family Services (Department), which became responsible for the children, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] placed them in unrelated foster care facilities until 1972.  During this period, they each received full AFDC-FC benefits of $105 a month.  In 1972, the Department decided to place two of the children with the Youakims, who were under no legal obligation to accept or support them. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The Department investigated the Youakim home and approved it as meeting the licensing standards established for unrelated foster family homes, as required by state law. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Despite this approval, the State refused to make Foster Care payments on behalf of the children because they were related to Linda Youakim.</p>\n<p>The exclusion of foster children living with related caretakers from Illinois\' AFDC-FC program reflects the State\'s view that the home of a relative covered under basic AFDC is not a "foster family home" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3), the federal AFDC-FC eligibility provision at issue here.  Interpreting that provision, Illinois defines a "foster family home" as</p>\n<p>"a facility for child care in residences of families who receive no more than 8 children <em>unrelated to them</em> . . . for the purpose of providing family care and training for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 440 U. S. 131</a></p><p> the children on a full-time basis. . . ."</p>\n<p>Ill.Ann.Stat., ch. 23, \xc2\xa7 2212.17 (Supp. 1978) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Homes that do not meet the definition may not be licensed, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and, under state law, only licensed facilities are entitled to Foster Care payments. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Although Illinois refused to make Foster Care payments, it did provide each child basic AFDC benefits of approximately $63 a month, substantially less than the applicable $105 AFDC-FC rate. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Youakims, however, believed that these payments were insufficient to provide proper support, and declined to accept the other two children.  These children remain in unrelated foster care facilities and continue to receive AFDC-FC benefits.</p>\n<p>In 1973, the Youakims and the four foster children brought a class action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 for themselves and persons similarly situated, challenging Illinois\' distinction between related and unrelated foster parents as violative of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  A three-judge District Court certified the class, but granted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 440 U. S. 132</a></p><p> summary judgment for the state officials on the constitutional claim.  374 F.Supp. 1204 (ND Ill.1974).</p>\n<p>While the direct appeal from the summary judgment was pending in this Court, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW) issued a formal interpretation of the scope of the federal AFDC-FC program, providing in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"When a child has been removed from his home by judicial determination and is placed in foster care under the various conditions specified in Section 408 of the Social Security Act and 45 CFR 233.110, the foster care rate of payment prevails regardless of whether or not the foster home is operated by a relative."</p>\n<p>HEW Program Instruction APA-PI-75-9 (Oct. 25, 1974).  In light of this administrative interpretation, we vacated the judgment and directed the District Court to consider whether the Illinois foster care scheme is inconsistent with the Social Security Act, and therefore invalid under the Supremacy Clause, U.S.Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  <em>Youakim v. Miller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/231/case.html">425 U. S. 231</a></span> (1976) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment for appellees, holding that the State\'s denial of AFDC-FC benefits and services to otherwise eligible foster children who live with relatives conflicts with \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 401 and 408 of the Social Security Act.  431 F.Supp. 40, 45 (ND Ill.1976). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  It found that, under the "plain words" of \xc2\xa7 408, dependent children adjudged to be wards of the State, removed from their homes, and placed in approved foster homes are entitled to AFDC-FC benefits, regardless of whether their foster parent is a relative.  431 F.Supp. at 44-45.  In so ruling, the court relied on HEW\'s interpretive ruling and on the national policy embodied </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 440 U. S. 133</a></p><p> in \xc2\xa7 401 of the Act to "encourag[e] the care of dependent children in their own homes or in the homes of relatives."  431 F.Supp. at 44.  Since the State had approved the Youakim home as meeting the licensing standards for unrelated foster homes, the District Court concluded that the requirements of \xc2\xa7 408 had been satisfied.  431 F.Supp. at 43-44.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals unanimously affirmed the judgment of the District Court.  562 F.2d 483 (CA7 1977). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  It held that the statutory definition of "foster family home" in the last sentence of \xc2\xa7 408 does not exclude relatives\' homes, and found no "implied legislative intent" to create such an exclusion. 562 F.2d at 487; <em>see id.</em> at 486, n. 4.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded that any home approved as meeting the State\'s licensing standards is a "foster family home" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 408.  562 F.2d at 486, 490.</p>\n<p>We noted probable jurisdiction, 434 U.S. 1060 (1978), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>A participating State may not deny assistance to persons who meet eligibility standards defined in the Social Security Act unless Congress clearly has indicated that the standards </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 440 U.

Congress has specified that programs, like AFDC-FC, which employ the term "dependent child" to define eligibility must be available for "all eligible individuals."  \xc2\xa7 402(a)(10), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 602(a)(10); <em>see Quern v. Mandley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/725/case.html">436 U.

Section 408(e) reinforces this general rule by requiring States to provide Foster Care benefits to "any" child who satisfies the federal eligibility criteria of \xc2\xa7 408(a).  Thus, if foster care in related homes is encompassed within \xc2\xa7 408, Illinois may not deny AFDC-FC benefits when it places an eligible child in the care of a relative.</p>\n<p>In arguing that related foster care does not fall within \xc2\xa7 408\'s definition of "foster family home," appellants submit that Congress enacted the Foster Care program solely for the benefit of children not otherwise eligible for categorical assistance.  We disagree.  The purpose of the AFDC-FC program was not simply to duplicate the AFDC program for a different class of beneficiaries.  As the language and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 408 demonstrate, the Foster Care program was designed to meet the particular needs of all eligible neglected children, whether they are placed with related or unrelated foster parents.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 408(a), in defining "dependent child," establishes four conditions of AFDC-FC eligibility.  First, the child must have been removed from the home of a parent or other relative specified in \xc2\xa7 406(a), the basic AFDC eligibility provision, "as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child."  \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a)(1).  Second, the State must remain responsible for the placement and care of the child.  \xc2\xa7 408(a)(2), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a)(2).  Third, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 440 U. S. 135</a></p><p> child must be placed in "a foster family home or child care institution." \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a)(3). Fourth, the child must have been eligible for categorical assistance under the State\'s plan prior to initiation of the removal proceedings. \xc2\xa7 408(a)(4), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(a)(4).</p>\n<p>The dispute in this case centers on the meaning of "foster family home" as used in the third eligibility requirement, \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3) of the Act.  The statute itself defines this phrase in sweeping language:</p>\n<p>"[T]he term \'foster family home\' means a foster family home for children which is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved, by the agency of such State responsible for licensing homes of this type, as meeting the standards established for such licensing."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 408, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608 (last sentence).  Congress manifestly did not limit the term to encompass only the homes of nonrelated caretakers.  Rather, any home that a State approves as meeting its licensing standards falls within the ambit of this definitional provision.  That Congress intended no distinction between related and unrelated foster homes is further demonstrated by the AFDC-FC definition of "aid to families with dependent children," which includes foster care for eligible children who live "in the foster family home <em>of any individual.</em>"  \xc2\xa7 408(b)(1), 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Far from excluding related caretakers, the statute uses the broadest possible language when it refers to the homes of foster parents.</p>\n<p>Appellants concede that these provisions do not explicitly bar from the Foster Care program children living with related foster parents.  Juris.Statement 11; Brief for Appellants 22; Reply Brief for Appellants 5; 562 F.2d at 486, and n. 4.  Nevertheless, they infer from two isolated passages of \xc2\xa7 408 a congressional intent to except relatives\' homes from the definition of "foster family home." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 440 U. S. 136</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Appellants first rely on the definition of dependent children in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) and (3).  These provisions state in relevant part:</p>\n<p>"(a) the term \'dependent child\' shall, notwithstanding section [406(a) -- the basic AFDC eligibility provision], <em>also</em> include a child (1) who would meet the requirements of such section [406(a)] except for his removal . . . from the home of a relative (specified in such section [406(a)]) as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child . . . [and] (3) who has been placed in a foster family home."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Appellants construe the "notwithstanding" language of \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) in conjunction with \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3) as creating a class of AFDC-FC beneficiaries distinct from the dependent children covered under basic AFDC.  In their view, "notwithstanding \xc2\xa7 406(a)" means that the Foster Care definition of "dependent child" both suspends the basic AFDC requirement that the child reside with a parent or close relative, and precludes a foster child who meets that requirement from participating in the AFDC-FC program.  Under appellants\' construction, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) and (3) would read:  For the purpose of Foster Care aid, a "dependent child" shall <em>only</em> include a child who would meet the requirements of \xc2\xa7 406(a) except that he has been both removed from the home of a parent or relative specified in \xc2\xa7 406(a) and placed in a nonrelative\'s home.</p>\n<p>The difficulty with this strained interpretation is that \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) does not use the word "only."  It states that a dependent child shall "also" include a child removed from the home of a parent or relative.  Thus, there is no basis for construing language that unquestionably expands the scope of the term "dependent child" as implicitly contracting the definition to exclude a child who meets the eligibility criteria of \xc2\xa7 406(a).  Because \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) does not have the preclusive meaning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 440 U. S. 137</a></p><p> urged by appellants, it cannot implicitly modify the phrase "foster family home" in \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3) to denote solely unrelated homes.  We think it clear that neither \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1) nor \xc2\xa7 408(a)(3) embodies a congressional intent to constrict the broad statutory definition of "foster family home."</p>\n<p>Appellants next maintain that interpreting AFDC-FC to encompass foster care by relatives would render meaningless another provision of the program.  Section 408(f)(1) of the Act obligates States to ensure that</p>\n<p>"services are provided which are designed to improve the conditions in the home from which [the foster child] was removed <em>or</em> to otherwise make possible his being placed in the home of a relative specified in section [406(a)]."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 608(f)(1) (emphasis added).  According to appellants, if related homes were "foster family homes," it would be unnecessary to require States to make the home of a relative suitable for placement when the foster child already lives in a relative\'s home.</p>\n<p>By ignoring the critical word "or," appellants misconstrue the import of this provision.  To be sure, \xc2\xa7 408(f) expresses a preference for the return of children to their original home or their transfer to the care of a relative.  Congress, however, expressed this preference in the alternative.  When a child is placed in related foster care, the State obviously can satisfy \xc2\xa7 408(f)(1) by working toward his ultimate return to the home from which he was removed, in this case the mother\'s home.  Thus, \xc2\xa7 408(f)(1) is fully consonant with including in the AFDC-FC program foster children placed with relatives.</p>\n<p>Had Congress intended to exclude related foster parents from the definition of "foster family home," it presumably would have done so explicitly, just as it restricted the definition of "child-care institution." [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Instead, the statute plainly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 440 U. S. 138</a></p><p> states that a foster family home is the home of any individual licensed or approved by the State as meeting its licensing requirements, and we are unpersuaded that the provisions on which appellants rely implicitly limit that expansive definition.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history and structure of the Act fortify our conclusion that the language of \xc2\xa7 408 should be given its full scope.  The Foster Care program was enacted in the aftermath of HEW\'s declaration that States could no longer discontinue basic AFDC assistance due to unsuitable home conditions "while the child continues to reside in the home."

In directing States "either to improve the home conditions" or "make arrangements for the child elsewhere," <em>ibid.,</em> the Ruling prompted Congress to encourage state protection of neglected children. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Accordingly, Congress designed a program carefully tailored to the needs of children whose "home environments . . . are clearly contrary to the[ir] best interests," [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] and it offered the States financial subsidies to implement the plan.  Neither the legislative history nor the structure of the Act indicates that Congress intended to differentiate among neglected children based on their relationship to their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 440 U. S. 139</a></p><p> foster parents.  Indeed, such a distinction would conflict in several respects with the overriding goal of providing the best available care for all dependent children removed from their homes because they were neglected.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 165, p. 6; 107 Cong.Rec. 6388 (1961) (remarks of Sen. Byrd).</p>\n<p>Although a fundamental purpose of the Foster Care program was to facilitate removal of children from their homes, Congress also took steps to "safeguard" intact family units from unnecessary upheaval.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 165, p. 7; 107 Cong.Rec. 6388 (1961) (remarks of Sen. Byrd). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  To ensure that children would be removed only from homes demonstrably inimical to their welfare, Congress required participating States to obtain "a judicial determination . . . that continuation in the home was contrary to the welfare of the child."  S.Rep. No. 165, p. 7; <em>see</em> 108 Cong.Rec. 12693 (1962) (remarks of Sen. Eugene McCarthy); \xc2\xa7 408(a)(1).  Protecting the integrity of established family units by mandating judicial approval of a State\'s decision to remove a child obviously is a goal that embraces all neglected children, regardless of who the ultimate caretaker may be.  Yet, under appellants\' construction of \xc2\xa7 408, the State would have no obligation to justify its removal of a dependent child if he were placed with relatives, since the child could not be eligible for Foster Care benefits.  But the same child, placed in unrelated facilities, would be entitled under the Foster Care program to a judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 440 U. S. 140</a></p><p> determination of neglect.  The rights of allegedly abused children and their guardians would thus depend on the happenstance of where they are placed, which is normally\' determined after a court has found removal necessary.  We are reluctant to attribute such an anomalous intent to Congress, particularly in the absence of any indication that it meant to protect from unnecessary removal only those dependent children placed with strangers.</p>\n<p>Congress was also concerned with assuring that States place neglected children in substitute homes determined appropriate for foster care.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 165, pp. 6-7.  To deter indiscriminate foster placements, Congress required that States establish licensing standards for every foster home, \xc2\xa7 408 (definition of "foster family home"), and supervise the placement of foster children.  \xc2\xa7 408(a)(2); <em>see</em> 45 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 220.19(a), 233.110(a)(2)(i) (1977).  The legislative materials at no point suggest that Congress intended to subject some foster homes, but not others, to minimum standards of quality, as could result if \xc2\xa7 408 excluded relatives\' homes from the definition of "foster family home."  Indeed, in authorizing an approval procedure as an alternative to actual licensing of "foster family homes," [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] Congress evinced its understanding that children placed in related foster homes are entitled to Foster Care benefits.  At the time the AFDC-FC program was enacted in 1961, many States exempted relatives\' homes from the licensing requirements imposed on all other types of settings in which foster children could be placed. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  It is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 440 U. S. 141</a></p><p> therefore likely that Congress, by including an approval procedure, meant to encompass foster homes not subject to State licensing requirements, in particular, related foster homes.</p>\n<p>The specific services offered by the AFDC-FC program further indicate that Congress did not intend to distinguish between related and unrelated foster caretakers.  Congress attached considerable significance to the unique needs and special problems of abused children who are removed from their homes by court order, distinguishing them as a class from other dependent children:</p>\n<p>"The conditions which make it necessary to remove [neglected] children from unsuitable homes often result in needs for special psychiatric and medical care of the children. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"These are the most underprivileged children, and often have special problems. . . ."</p>\n<p>108 Cong.Rec. 12692-12693 (1962) (remarks of Sen. Eugene McCarthy).  Section 408 embodies Congress\' recognition of the peculiar status of neglected children in requiring that States continually supervise the care of these children, \xc2\xa7 408(a)(2), develop a plan tailored to the needs of each foster child "to assure that he receives proper care," \xc2\xa7 408(f)(1), and periodically review both the necessity of retaining the child in foster care and the appropriateness of the care being provided.  <em>See ibid.;</em> 45 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 220.19(b), (c), 233.110(a)(2)(ii) (1977).  Additionally, the States must work to improve the conditions in the foster child\'s original home or to transfer him to a relative when feasible, \xc2\xa7 408(f)(1); <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/125/case.html#137">440 U. S. 137</a></span>.  This procedure comports with Congress\' preference for care of dependent children by relatives, a policy underlying the categorical assistance program since its inception in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 440 U. S. 142</a></p><p> 1935.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 628, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 117 (1935); H.R.Rep. No 615, 74th Cong., 1st Sess., 10-12 (1935); <em>Burns v. Alcala,</em> 420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/575/case.html#581">420 U.

S. 132</a></span>-133. We do not believe that Congress, when it extended assistance to foster children, meant to depart from this fundamental principle. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Congress envisioned a remedial environment to correct the enduring effects of past neglect and abuse.  There is nothing to indicate that it intended to discriminate between potential beneficiaries, equally in need of the program, on the basis of their relationship to their foster parents.</p>\n<p>That Congress had no such intent is also evidenced by the 1967 amendments to the Act, which increased the federal matching </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 440 U. S. 143</a></p><p> payments for AFDC-FC to exceed the federal share of basic AFDC payments. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The increase reflects Congress\' recognition that state-supervised care and programs designed to meet the special needs of neglected children cost more than basic AFDC care. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The legislative history of the amendment reveals no basis for distinguishing between related and unrelated foster homes. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Rather, it discloses a generalized concern for the plight of all dependent children who should be sheltered from their current home environments but are forced to remain in such homes because of the States\' inability to finance substitute care.  S.Rep. No. 744, pp. 163-165; H.R.Rep. No. 544, pp. 100-101.  Significantly, the Committee Reports suggest that increasing federal matching payments would encourage relatives "not legally responsible for support" to undertake the care of foster children "in order to obtain the best possible environment for the child."  S.Rep. No. 744, p. 164; H.R.Rep. No. 544, p. 101.  The amendments are therefore described, without qualification, as providing "more favorable Federal matching . . . for foster care for children removed from an unsuitable home by court order."  S.Rep. No. 744, p. 4; H.R.Rep. No. 544, p. 4.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Our interpretation of the statute and its legislative history is buttressed by HEW Program Instruction APA-PI-79, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 440 U. S. 144</a></p><p> which requires States to provide AFDC-FC benefits "regardless of whether the . . . foster family home in which a child is placed is operated by a relative."  In reaching this conclusion, the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare reasoned:</p>\n<p>"A non-legally liable relative has no financial responsibility towards the child placed with him and the income and resources of such a relative are not factors in determining entitlement to a foster care payment.  It must be noted, too, that the 1967 amendments to the Social Security Act liberalized Federal financial participation in the cost of foster care, recognizing foster family care is more costly than care in the child\'s own home."</p>\n<p>HEW Program Instruction APA-PI-75-9.</p>\n<p>We noted in vacating the original three-judge District Court decision in this case that</p>\n<p>"[t]he interpretation of a statute by an agency charged with its enforcement is a substantial factor to be considered in construing the statute."</p>\n<p><em>Youakim v.

HEW\'s Program Instruction is fully supported by the statute, its legislative history, and the common sense observation that all dependent foster children are similarly in need of the protections and monetary benefits afforded by the AFDC-FC program.

The overriding purpose of \xc2\xa7 408 was to assure that the most appropriate substitute care be given to those dependent children so mistreated that a court has ordered them removed from their homes.  The need for additional AFDC-FC resources -- both monetary and service related -- to provide a proper remedial environment for such foster children arises from the status of the child as a subject of prior neglect, not from the status of the foster parent. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Appellants attribute to Congress an intent to differentiate among children who are equally neglected and abused, based on a living arrangement bearing no relationship to the special needs that the AFDC-FC program was created to meet.

For example, by threatening to discontinue basic AFDC aid or to initiate neglect proceedings, States had coerced many welfare mothers into "voluntarily" placing their children with relatives, although a court might not have ordered removal had formal proceedings been initiated.  <em>See ibid.;</em> W.

They contend that permitting AFDC-FC assistance for foster children who live with relatives would create a "financial incentive" for relatives to refrain from caring for needy children until the children are removed from their homes by court order.  Brief for Appellants 26.  Even if this were true, "issue[s] of legislative policy . . . [are] better addressed to the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment of this Court."  <em>Marquette Nat. Bank v. First of Omaha Service Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/299/case.html">439 U.

Furthermore, we view the inclusion of related foster homes in \xc2\xa7 408 as fully consistent with Congress\' determination that homes of parents and relatives provide the most suitable environment for children.  Congress evidently believed that encouraging relatives to care for these "most underprivileged children," 108 Cong.Rec. 12693 (1962) (remarks of Sen. Eugene McCarthy), whatever the cost, was worth the price.  Indeed, if the State\'s interpretation of the statute were correct, relatives would have an incentive to refuse to accept foster children altogether.  Concerned relatives might subordinate their interests in supervising the wellbeing of youngsters they love to ensure that these children receive the greater cash benefits and services available only to foster children placed in unrelated homes.  Similarly, the availability of significantly more financial assistance under AFDC-FC might motivate child placement authorities to refrain from placing foster children with relatives even when these homes are best suited to the needs of the child.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Social Security Amendments of 1967, Pub.L. 9248, \xc2\xa7 205(b), 81 Stat. 892, \xc2\xa7 403(a)(1)(B) of the Social Security Act, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 603(a)(1)(b); <em>see</em> S.Rep.

They refer to an inconsistent interpretation of \xc2\xa7 408 sent to Illinois authorities in 1971 by a regional HEW official, which stated that foster children placed in related homes are not eligible for Foster Care benefits under the federal program.  However, this correspondence was not approved by HEW\'s General Counsel or by any departmental official in the national office.  <em>See</em> letter from HEW\'s Assistant General Counsel to Illinois Special Assistant Attorney General Richard Ryan (Dec. 22, 1976), App. to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1a.  Since the letter did not reflect an official position, we take the Program Instruction to be the agency\'s first and only national interpretation concerning \xc2\xa7 408\'s coverage of foster care by relatives.  Appellants\' reliance on <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert, supra,</em> is therefore misplaced, and we are bound by the "principle that the construction of a statute by those charged with its execution should be followed unless there are compelling indications that it is wrong."  <em>Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
