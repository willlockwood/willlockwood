JUSTICE CLARK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act provides that "common carriers" engaged in the "transportation" of oil or other commodities shall be subject to the regulatory requirements specified in other sections of the statute. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In an earlier proceeding, this Court found that Champlin, as owner of a pipeline, was a "common carrier" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1, and on the record there presented the Court upheld an ICC order under \xc2\xa7 19a(a)-(e) of the Act requiring the company to submit valuation data, maps, charts and other documents pertaining to its operations. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html">Champlin Refining Co. v. United States,</a></span></em> 329 U.S. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="292">Page 341 U. S. 292</a></p><p> 29 (1946).  The present proceeding involves a subsequent ICC order directing Champlin (1) to file annual, periodic and special reports, and to institute and maintain a uniform system of accounts applicable to pipelines, both under \xc2\xa7 20 of the Act; [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and (2) to publish and file schedules showing the rates and charges for interstate transportation of refined petroleum products, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 6. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="293">Page 341 U. S. 293</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A specially constituted three-judge District Court, with one member dissenting, refused to enforce the order on the ground that Champlin, at least for the purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 20, is not within the class of carriers intended to be regulated by the Act.  It held further that to impose the requirements of \xc2\xa7 6 on Champlin would be to take its property without due process in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  95 F.Supp. 170.  The Government and the Commission appealed, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1253, 2101(e), 2325.</p>\n<p>The facts here are substantially the same as in the earlier case.  Champlin owns and operates a pipeline running from its refinery at Enid, Oklahoma, to terminals at Hutchinson, Kansas, Superior, Nebraska, and Rock Rapids, Iowa -- a distance of 516 miles.  It uses the pipeline solely to carry its own refined petroleum products, such as gasoline and kerosene.  No other refiner has connections with the line, and none has ever shipped products through it.  The line does not connect with any other pipeline.  Champlin has storage facilities at each of its three terminals.  Jobbers purchasing Champlin products supply their own transportation from the storage tanks to their bulk depots.</p>\n<p>Since the first case, there has been a change in Champlin\'s method of quoting prices.  At the time of the earlier proceeding, the price was computed as f.o.b. the Enid refinery, plus a differential equal to the through rail rate from Enid to the purchaser\'s destination minus the charges for local transportation between the nearest pipeline terminal and the destination.  However, Champlin made frequent and substantial departures from this formula in order to meet competitive prices at various locations.  In May, 1948, the company began quoting prices as f.o.b. the respective terminals, a policy which is still in effect.  But, as before, adjustments are made so that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="294">Page 341 U. S. 294</a></p><p> delivered prices to jobbers will be competitive with those offered by other refiners.</p>\n<p>On the basis of these and other facts, the Government contends (1) that there are no significant factual differences between this and the prior case, and therefore Champlin is barred by collateral estoppel from relitigating the holding of this Court that it is a "common carrier" engaged in "transportation" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act; (2) that, since the definition of "common carrier" in \xc2\xa7 1 applies to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 20 as well as to \xc2\xa7 19a, the Court\'s prior holding <em>per se</em> establishes the validity of the present order; (3) that, even if estoppel does not apply, the facts are adequate under the statute to support the Commission\'s order; (4) that the alleged constitutional question is frivolous.</p>\n<p>Champlin claims (1) that factual changes remove this case from the realm of collateral estoppel; (2) that the Court specifically reserved the statutory issue presented by this case, namely whether the ICC may convert a private carrier into a common carrier for hire, and (3) that the lower court was correct in holding that the Act violates the Fifth Amendment if construed to authorize the ICC\'s order.</p>\n<p>We agree with the Government that there have been no significant factual changes in Champlin\'s operations since the prior case.  The practice of quoting prices f.o.b. Enid made it superficially more obvious that transportation charges were being collected, a point which the Court brought out.  329 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html#34">329 U. S. 34</a></span>.  And the record indicates that the change to an f.o.b. terminal formula resulted in minor alterations in the pattern of relative delivered prices at various locations.  But Champlin is still transporting, and unless it has launched on a calculated plan of bankruptcy, its prices, on the average, are necessarily intended to cover transportation costs as well as other costs.  Champlin further points out that it has constructed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="295">Page 341 U. S. 295</a></p><p> ethyl plants at two of its pipeline terminals, and is there processing some 20 percent of its products.  It claims that this change makes the pipeline a part of "manufacturing" facilities, and thus brings the company within the <em>Uncle Sam</em> rule, which excepted a class of gathering lines from the coverage of the Act.  <em>Pipe Line Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html">234 U. S. 548</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html#562">234 U. S. 562</a></span> (1914).  But a Champlin officer testified in this case that the company has "always done some blending and treating" of its products at the terminals, and 80 percent of the products are still transported in their final form.  Hence, there is no justification for reconsidering this Court\'s refusal to "expand the actual holding" of the <em>Uncle Sam</em> case to include Champlin, and its ruling that Champlin was a "common carrier" as defined by \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act.</p>\n<p>However, we disagree with the Government\'s contention that the prior holding disposes of all the statutory issues in this case.  To be sure, the literal terms of the statute lend some weight to the Government\'s argument.  Section 1(1) provides that "The provisions of this part" shall apply to "common carriers" as defined, the word "part" referring to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1-27 inclusive. Section 19a, under which the earlier order was issued, applies to "every common carrier subject to the provisions of this part."  Section 20 applies to "carriers," which is defined in subparagraph (8) as "common carrier[s] subject to this chapter;" and \xc2\xa7 6 applies to "every common carrier subject to the provisions of this chapter."  Hence, the Commission\'s jurisdiction to issue orders under any of these sections is determined by a decision that a company is a "common carrier" under \xc2\xa7 1.  The Government in effect argues, however, that a decision as to jurisdiction also settles the merits, that facts adequate to support a specific valuation order under \xc2\xa7 19a are also adequate to support an order under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6 and 20.  But this is the very conclusion which this Court necessarily rejected in <em>Champlin I.</em>  In </p><p><a class="page-number" name="296">Page 341 U. S. 296</a></p><p> that case, it was Champlin which argued that an interpretation encompassing it within \xc2\xa7 1 would convert a private pipeline into a public utility and require it to become a common carrier in fact.  But the Court stated that</p>\n<p>"our conclusion rests on no such basis, and affords no such implication . . .  [The contention] is too premature and hypothetical to warrant consideration. . . ."</p>\n<p>329 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html#35">329 U. S. 35</a></span>.  In holding merely that Champlin could be required to submit information as a "common carrier" under the Act, the Court plainly indicated that the application of more rigorous sanctions would be reserved for treatment as an independent statutory issue on a proper record.</p>\n<p>The reasons for this approach were suggested in <em>Valvoline Oil Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/141/case.html">308 U. S. 141</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/141/case.html#146">308 U. S. 146</a></span> (1939).  Collection of information has a significance independent from the imposition of regulations, whether or not such regulations ever come forth.  Valuation and cost data from companies not subject to ratemaking may add to the statistical reliability of standards imposed on those companies which are.  "Publicity alone may give effective remedy to abuses, if any there be."  308 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/141/case.html#146">308 U. S. 146</a></span>.  Disclosure may alter the future course of a company otherwise disposed to indulge in activities which the statute condemns.  Disclosure provides the basis for prompt action should a future change in circumstances make full-scale regulation appropriate.  Finally, reports may bring to light new abuses, and thus provide the groundwork for future statutory amendments.  We assume that the Congress which passed the Interstate Commerce Act was well aware of these benefits.  We conclude, as before, that the Congress did not mean to eschew them by omitting a general provision empowering the Commission to collect pertinent data from all interstate pipelines.</p>\n<p>The prior holding, therefore, supports that part of the Commission\'s order involving \xc2\xa7 20 of the Act.  The requirement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 341 U. S. 297</a></p><p> of annual and special reports cannot be differentiated from a request for maps, charts and valuation data.  The requirement that Champlin maintain a uniform system of accounts is somewhat more burdensome, but we think its independent value as a measuring rod for companies fully regulated under the Act is clearly sufficient to justify the Commission\'s requesting so much as is pertinent.</p>\n<p>At the same time, we find it hard to conclude, despite the generality of the statutory terms used, that Congress intended to apply the sanctions of \xc2\xa7 6 -- imposing the duty of serving the public at regulated rates -- on all private pipelines merely because they cross state lines.  The statute cannot be divorced from the circumstances existing at the time it was passed, and from the evil which Congress sought to correct and prevent.  The circumstances and the evil are well known.  Pipelines were few in number and heavily concentrated under the control of one company, Standard Oil.  That company, through the ownership of subsidiaries and affiliates, had</p>\n<p>"made itself master of the only practicable oil transportation between the oil fields east of California and the Atlantic Ocean and carried much the greater part of the oil between those points. . . .  Availing itself of its monopoly of the means of transportation, [it] refused through its subordinates to carry any oil unless the same was sold to it or to them . . . on terms more or less dictated by itself."</p>\n<p><em>Pipe Line Cases, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html#559">234 U. S. 559</a></span>.  Small independent producers -- who lacked the resources to construct their own lines or whose output was so small that a pipeline built to carry that output alone would be economically unfeasible -- were in a desperate competitive position.  There is little doubt, from the legislative history, that the Act was passed to eliminate the competitive advantage which existing or future integrated companies might possess from exclusive ownership of a pipeline. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="298">Page 341 U. S. 298</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This evil could not have been reached by bringing within the coverage of the Act only those pipelines who were common carriers for hire in the common law sense.  Attempts so to limit the Act\'s scope were made during the course of congressional debates.  Senator Lodge, sponsor of the principal amendment, rendered the obvious answer that such an alteration would "absolutely destroy [the proposal] . . . so far as its effectiveness is concerned."  40 Cong.Rec. 7000 (1906).  Hence, the bill as finally enacted was clearly intended</p>\n<p>"to bring within its scope pipelines that, although not technically common carriers yet, were carrying all oil offered, if only the offerers would sell at their price."</p>\n<p><em>Pipe Line Cases, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/334/558/case.html#560">334 U. S. 560</a></span>.  <em>And see Valvoline Oil Co. v. United States, supra.</em>  We may also assume for purposes of argument -- no such facts ever having been before this Court -- that the generality of the term "all pipelines" was meant to impose full regulation on integrated producer pipelines who exploit a competitive advantage simply by refusing to deal with independent producers having no comparably cheap method of reaching consuming markets.  But it would be strange to suppose that Congress, in adopting a term broad enough to cover all competitive imbalances which might arise, intended that the Commission should make common carriers for hire out of private pipelines whose services were unused, unsought after, and unneeded by independent producers, and whose presence fosters competition in markets heavily blanketed by large "majors."  Such a step would at best, be pointless; it might well subvert the chief purpose of the Act.</p>\n<p>Yet, on the record before us, this is precisely what the Commission is attempting to do.  Unlike the crude oil gathering lines of Valvoline, which carried the products of over 3,800 independent owners and operators, Champlin\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 341 U. S. 299</a></p><p> refined products line carries only its own. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The Government concedes that the order under \xc2\xa7 6 carries a necessary implication that Champlin may now be forced to devote its pipeline, at least partially, to public use.  Nevertheless, the Commission has not only failed to disclose circumstances which the Act was passed to correct, but has either assumed or made findings to the contrary.  In addition to findings previously referred to, the Commission stated as follows:</p>\n<p>"Only about 1.98 percent of the total gasoline consumed in [Champlin\'s marketing] area is moved through the pipeline and sold from respondent\'s terminal storage facilities. . . .  The total capacity of the common carrier lines into the Nebraska market is about 13 times that of the Champlin line and about 10 times that of the latter into the Iowa market.  The common carrier pipeline capacity available to refineries in Oklahoma and Kansas aggregates 172,800 barrels a day [in contrast to Champlin\'s capacity of 9,800 barrels], and respondent\'s pipeline is the smallest </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 341 U. S. 300</a></p><p> of any common carrier or private pipeline operating in this territory.  Apparently <em>common carrier pipeline transportation is available to any small refiner in this area desiring such transportation.</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"So far as appears, no other pipeline company has threatened to force . . . a connection [with Champlin\'s], and because of the <em>ample common carrier pipeline facilities available, as revealed by respondent, no refinery would be likely to interest itself in such a connection.</em>"</p>\n<p>274 ICC 412-413, 415 (1949).  (Emphasis supplied.)  The court below, in its Findings of Fact, concluded that</p>\n<p>"Champlin does not have a monopoly or any power to establish a monopoly either in the transportation of petroleum products into the trade territory or in the sale of petroleum products therein."</p>\n<p>95 F.Supp. 170 (1950).  It further found that</p>\n<p>"Champlin . . . is a small company in comparison with companies with which it competes in the area reached by its pipeline. . . .  Champlin\'s acts create competition."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> <em>See also</em> Chairman Splawn, dissenting from the Commission report.  274 ICC 416. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Government seeks to rebuild its case by pointing to small refiners who are closer to Champlin\'s pipeline than to any other, and by stressing the expense of building long connecting lines.  But there is no evidence that any of these refiners wish to market </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 341 U. S. 301</a></p><p> outside their immediate area.  And, in any event, it is not the function of this Court to rescue the Commission by making findings <em>de novo</em> which the Commission itself was unable or unwilling to make.  We hold that, on this record, the Commission\'s order, insofar as it concerns \xc2\xa7 6, goes beyond what Congress contemplated when it passed the Act.</p>\n<p>The judgment below will be modified by striking out those portions setting aside the Commission\'s order in Cause No. 29912, <em>Champlin Refining Company Accounts and Reports,</em> and, as modified, it is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

However, the Commission, both in this case and in <em>Champlin I,</em> gave no consideration, either in the hearings or the orders, to Champlin\'s gathering facilities.</p>\n<p>In any event, it would seem that Champlin\'s exclusive ownership of the refined products line would be of no concern to independent crude oil producers unless the following assumptions were true:  (a) that independent refiners were shut out of gasoline markets which they would otherwise enter; (b) that this reduced their output below the capacity of their refineries; (c) that this decreased their demand for crude oil, thus reducing their competition with Champlin in the purchase of crude, and thus depressing the price which crude oil producers could get.  As to the first, and crucial, assumption, the Commission found precisely to the contrary.  <em>See</em> text, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>". . .  [T]he evidence is clear that there has been, and is, no holding out by Champlin of a common carrier service either directly or indirectly.  None of the products moved through the line has ever been purchased from any other interest.  Moreover, the evidence shows that the products transported through Champlin\'s pipeline constitutes an inconsequential part of the total volume of products that moves by pipeline to the consuming territory served by Champlin from its storage facilities."</p>\n<p>"Requiring Champlin to comply with our valuation orders and the requirements of section 20 of the act . . . is one thing, but to require it to file tariffs, and thereby obligate itself to transport oil products of others in common carrier service, to the exclusion of its own, is something entirely different."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The purpose of the amendment in 1906 was to protect small independent producers from monopoly power.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE REED and MR. JUSTICE BURTON concur, concurring in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>The term "common carrier" has but one meaning in the Act -- the meaning given it by \xc2\xa7 1.  That definition was held in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html">Champlin Refining Co. v. United States,</a></span></em> 329 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 341 U. S. 302</a></p><p> U.S. 29, sufficiently broad to include appellee.  Section 19a was involved there, and \xc2\xa7 6 is involved here.  That may make a constitutional difference; but there can be none so far as the statute is concerned.  Since \xc2\xa7 6, like \xc2\xa7 19a, can reach appellee only through \xc2\xa7 1, if \xc2\xa7 1 is broad enough for the one section, it is broad enough for the other.  As the Court in its several decisions has not been consistent in its interpretation of the scope of the Act as applied to private pipelines, I feel free to follow the precedent of the <em>Pipe Line Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html">234 U. S. 548</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html#561">234 U.

Consequently, I agree that \xc2\xa7 1 is not broad enough to bring appellee under the regulatory power of the Interstate Commerce Commission.  Therefore, neither \xc2\xa7 6 nor \xc2\xa7 20 applies.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE BLACK, dissenting.</p>\n<p>From whatever angle this case is approached, it seems to me that the holding of the Court is wrong.  The decision rides roughshod over clear statutory language making the Hepburn Act [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] applicable to interstate oil-carrying pipelines, and makes impossible enforcement of the Act as Congress intended.  The decision undercuts and I think overrules several prior cases without mentioning </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 341 U. S. 303</a></p><p> this fact.  And this appellant, Champlin, is even given a second trial and victorious relitigation of the same issues we had previously determined against it.  Finally, the opinion suggests to me that the Court accepts what I deem to be a frivolous constitutional challenge to the Act, namely that Congress is without power to force oil-carrying interstate pipelines to serve as common carriers for hire.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s holding that Champlin must comply with \xc2\xa7 20 of the Hepburn Act, but need not comply with \xc2\xa7 6, cannot be reconciled with clear language in those sections or with our previous decisions construing the same language.  Section 20 authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission to require that "all common carriers subject to the provisions of this Act" [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] file, among other things, certain annual reports; \xc2\xa7 6 commands that "Every common carrier subject to the provisions of this Act" [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] shall file schedules of rates with the Commission.  I do not understand why it should be necessary to labor the obvious -- this language requires Champlin (if it is a "common carrier subject to the . . . Act") to comply with \xc2\xa7 6 if it is required to comply with \xc2\xa7 20, or to comply with \xc2\xa7 20 if it is required to comply with \xc2\xa7 6.  The Court holds that Champlin is a "common carrier subject to" the Act, and accordingly sustains the Commission\'s order to file reports under \xc2\xa7 20.  Paradoxically, however, it then proceeds to hold that the same Champlin, though "subject to" the Act, need not comply with \xc2\xa7 6.  How the Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 341 U. S. 304</a></p><p> gives the identical language in the two sections such different meanings is left a mystery. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court may be saying that \xc2\xa7 6 is something <em>sui generis,</em> that no pipeline company need comply with that section unless it is something more than a "common carrier subject to the . . . Act." [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  While the meaning of this "something more" is not made clear, the Court, in overturning the Commission order, does suggest in passing that it might possibly sustain an order requiring Champlin to comply with \xc2\xa7 6 upon Commission findings that the company exploited</p>\n<p>"a competitive advantage simply by refusing to deal with independent producers having no comparably cheap method of reaching consuming markets,"</p>\n<p>or that Champlin enjoyed a "monopoly" position in its area.  Certainly nothing in the Hepburn Act should encourage such judicial creativeness, for \xc2\xa7 6 applies to "Every common carrier subject to the . . . Act" in language which does not logically admit of limiting the section\'s coverage to carriers that have refused "to deal with independent producers" or achieved "monopoly" status.  That \xc2\xa7 6 would or could be thus restricted was not hinted at in the <em>Pipe Line Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html">234 U. S. 548</a></span> (where this section was involved), nor in <em>Valvoline Oil Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/308/141/case.html">308 U. S. 141</a></span>, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] nor in our decision in the first <em>Champlin</em> case, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html">Champlin Rfg. Co. v. United States,</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 341 U. S. 305</a></p><p> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/29/case.html">329 U. S. 29</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  It should be noted that the dissenting justices in <em>Champlin I</em> thought that an additional "something" was necessary before the Hepburn Act was applicable; they believed that none of the Act\'s provisions should apply to pipeline companies unless they were "common carriers in substance."  But neither those justices nor anyone else, so far as I know, have ever before suggested that the Court can pick and choose sections into which additional requirements can be imported.  This possibility remained for today\'s majority to discover, 46 years after passage of the Hepburn Act. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Far more important than the judicial exemption of Champlin from filing papers under \xc2\xa7 6, however, is the Court\'s holding that pipeline companies engaged in interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 341 U. S. 306</a></p><p> transportation of their own petroleum products need not act as public carriers for hire unless they have already voluntarily become "something more" than interstate oil-carrying pipelines.  The proper answer to this basic question in the case turns on \xc2\xa7 1 of the Hepburn Act:</p>\n<p>"[T]his Act shall apply to any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity . . . by means of pipelines . . . who shall be considered and held to be common carriers within the meaning and purpose of this Act. . . . [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]"</p>\n<p>That Champlin is a common carrier within the literal language of this provision is shown by the unchallenged findings of fact made by the ICC:  Champlin, a fully integrated company, produces, refines, transports and markets petroleum products.  Through a wholly owned subsidiary, it also buys, gathers, and transports to its refinery oil produced from the wells of others. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Its trunk pipeline extends 516 miles across five states from its refinery at Enid, Oklahoma, to its terminal at Rock Rapids, Iowa.  Although application of the Act does not depend on a pipeline company\'s size, Champlin is by no means a small company; rather, it occupies an important position in the area it serves. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  But for the Court\'s holding, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 341 U. S. 307</a></p><p> I should have thought that \xc2\xa7 1 of the Act on the admitted facts obviously required Champlin to serve as a common carrier for the products of others.</p>\n<p>That the Hepburn Act did convert Champlin into a public carrier for hire is made even clearer by the legislative history.  The pipeline provision was sponsored in 1906 by Senator Henry Cabot Lodge, of Massachusetts, who offered to amend a pending railroad bill in a manner which would convert interstate oil-carrying pipelines into common carriers subject to regulation by the ICC. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]  The Lodge Amendment reflected dissatisfaction with monopoly conditions in the petroleum industry.  Such conditions, it was thought, had been brought about in the main through control of oil-carrying pipelines by large integrated companies (especially the Standard Oil Company) which were using their control to exclude independent producers and refiners from this cheap transportation facility. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  But the ensuing debate left no room for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 341 U. S. 308</a></p><p> doubt that the purpose of the Amendment, as its language clearly showed, was to deprive any oil company, not merely Standard, [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] of power to utilize pipeline control to crush competition.  To this end, as is shown by an <l=|341 290app|="" u.s.="">Appendix following this opinion, the Amendment was designed to make public or common carriers for hire out of every private pipeline company transporting petroleum products in interstate commerce.  Senators who were opposed charged that the passage of the Amendment would do exactly this against the will of "private" carriers.  Lodge and other proponents freely admitted it, explaining that anything less would be ineffective.  All congressional efforts to narrow the Amendment to cover only companies already acting like common carriers were defeated.  </l=|341></p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 341 U. S. 309</a></p><p> Therefore it is strange to say, as the Court does, that applying the pipeline provisions so as to make Champlin a common carrier for hire would "subvert the chief purpose of the Act."  Stranger still is the Court\'s unexplained apprehension that requiring all interstate pipeline companies to serve as public carriers for hire would somehow "foster" monopoly.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court, without mentioning it, necessarily overrules one or more of our previous decisions construing the Hepburn Act.  In the <em>Pipe Line Cases, supra,</em> it was held that the Hepburn Act converted into common carriers for hire all private pipeline companies "engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity" across state lines, a decision which meant that all such companies are by law required to offer their services to the public. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 341 U. S. 310</a></p><p> In the first <em>Champlin</em> case, <em>supra,</em> we determined that this appellant was so "engaged." [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]  Consequently, today\'s decision allowing Champlin to refrain from filing tariffs under \xc2\xa7 6 necessarily overrules either the <em>Pipe Line Cases</em> or <em>Champlin I,</em> or both.  If they are to be overruled, the Court should say so.  I would not overrule either.</p>\n<p>Nor do I understand how today\'s holding can be reconciled with <em>Valvoline Oil Co. v. United States, supra,</em> where we held that Valvoline was a "common carrier subject to" the Act.  The pattern of operations of Valvoline and Champlin are identical, with two minor exceptions:  (1) Valvoline\'s interstate pipelines transported crude oil, while Champlin\'s trunk line transports gasoline.  This difference is immaterial; even assuming that "gasoline" is not "oil" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1, that section makes the Act apply not merely to any pipeline company carrying "oil," but to pipeline companies carrying any "other commodity."  (2) Valvoline chose to operate its gathering lines and purchase oil from independent producers in its own corporate name, while Champlin chooses to operate its gathering lines and purchase oil in the name of a wholly owned subsidiary.  The Court, however, had no difficulty in the <em>Pipe Line Cases</em> in treating as a single unit the Standard Oil Company and its wholly owned or even partly owned subsidiaries. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]</p>\n<p>It should be noted, moreover, that Valvoline unsuccessfully made the same contention that the Court now </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 341 U. S. 311</a></p><p> accepts in order to relieve Champlin from its statutory duties.  Thus, Valvoline attempted to avoid becoming a common carrier for hire by claiming that the Act applied only to companies enjoying a monopoly position in an area, a position not held by Valvoline because public pipelines for hire adequately served the fields where Valvoline bought its oil. [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  The ICC refused to accept Valvoline\'s proposed interpretation of the Act, and we necessarily did the same in affirming the Commission\'s order.</p>\n<p>The Court nevertheless seeks to distinguish the <em>Valvoline</em> case on the ground that Valvoline "carried the products of over 3,800 independent owners and operators."  The quoted language correctly states a fact only if it is understood to mean that Valvoline made purchases from 3,800 independents and then carried the purchased oil in its pipeline.  This fact, however, certainly does not distinguish the two cases.  Like Valvoline, Champlin carries the "oil of others" all the way from the well to the market area:  over half of the oil and gasoline carried by Champlin is originally purchased as crude oil from independent producers in the field before transportation begins. [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>]  As noted above, Champlin does make these purchases through a wholly owned subsidiary, rather than in its own corporate name, but this fact is unimportant. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 341 U. S. 312</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Since there is no substantial difference between the operations of Champlin and Valvoline, and between the legal arguments made in the two cases, I conclude that, verbalisms aside, the effect of today\'s decision is to undermine the <em>Valvoline</em> holding.  In this situation, I think <em>Valvoline</em> should be expressly overruled.  Why, in fairness, should Valvoline and others similarly situated be required to serve as common carriers for hire, while Champlin is left free to conduct its pipelines as it chooses?</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the first <em>Champlin</em> case, we upheld findings of fact made by the I.C.C., 49 Val.Rep.(I.C.C.) 463, 470, that appellant was "engaged in the transportation" and was "a common carrier subject to the provisions of" the Act.  Since these questions were "distinctly put in issue and directly determined," Champlin may not dispute them in this second proceeding between the same parties unless there is a departure from the principles most recently announced in <em>United States v. Munsingwear,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/case.html">340 U. S. 36</a></span>, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 341 U. S. 313</a></p><p> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/36/case.html#38">340 U. S. 38</a></span>.  Yet three concurring justices today appear to take the position that Champlin is not "engaged in transportation," and is therefore not a common carrier subject to the Act, a position which this Court emphatically rejected in <em>Champlin I.</em>  I also believe that the majority\'s position is unjustified under the <em>Munsingwear</em> principle when the effect (as distinguished from the language) of their decision is considered.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Why should the Court interpret the Hepburn Act in a way which nullifies its purpose?  I am forced by process of elimination to consider whether the decision reflects either a hostility to the policy of the Act or an unarticulated belief that it is unconstitutional if enforced as written.  Neither this Court nor any other should strangle an Act because of judicial disagreement with congressional policy.  If destruction of the Act results from a feeling that the Constitution forbids Congress to convert private companies into public servants, I think that this view should be announced here, as it was by a majority of the court below.  Pipeline companies, administrators of the law, the bench, the bar, and the Congress are entitled to no less.  Of course, the same constitutional contention was expressly rejected in 1914 in the <em>Pipe Line Cases, supra:</em>  as to companies which, like Champlin, built their lines after passage of the Act, Justice Holmes, speaking for the Court, dismissed the challenge brusquely with less than a sentence, stating merely that "there can be no doubt that it [the pipeline provision] is valid."  234 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/234/548/case.html#561">234 U. S. 561</a></span>.  Again, in 1922, the Court, relying on the <em>Pipe Line Cases, supra,</em> rejected a somewhat similar constitutional argument as "futile to the point almost of being frivolous."  <em>Pierce Oil Corp. v. Phoenix Rfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/125/case.html">259 U. S. 125</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/125/case.html#128">259 U. S. 128</a></span>.  Surely a contention deemed "almost frivolous" twenty-nine years ago should not now be reinvigorated by implication. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 341 U. S. 314</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>No one can be sure that, under the Act as now rewritten by the Court, the Commission can or should succeed in forcing any oil company -- even those now complying with the Act -- to carry gasoline or oil for others as a common carrier.  Even without the newly engrafted, Court-created hurdles, the pipeline provisions, for one reason or another, have never been enforced as effectively as might be desired. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  Perhaps, therefore, no great harm will result from the Court\'s polite but sure frustration of the Hepburn Act\'s purpose.  Some people in and familiar with the oil industry, however, believe that this Act should be strengthened, not weakened. [<a href="#F2/22" name="T2/22">Footnote 2/22</a>]  Be that as it may, I deem it my duty to vote to enforce the Act as Congress has passed it.</p>\n<p>I would reverse. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 341 U.

But the Government has never intimated that the sections of the Act as a matter of <em>statutory</em> construction were "separable."  Even an assumption that the sections were separable, however, would not justify the Court in exempting Champlin from \xc2\xa7 6 unless it could find support for such an exemption in some statutory language.

Senator Lodge of Massachusetts, on the same day, introduced an amendment to \xc2\xa7 1 of the Hepburn Act making pipeline companies engaged in the interstate transportation of oil and other commodities common carriers:</p>\n<p>"[That the provisions of this act shall apply to] Any corporation or any person or persons engaged in the transportation of oil or other commodity, except natural gas or water for municipal purposes, by means of pipelines, or partly by pipelines and partly by railroad, or partly by pipelines and partly by water, who shall be considered and held to be common carriers within the meaning and purpose of this act. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6361. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 341 U. S. 316</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Senator Foraker of Ohio immediately objected to the broad scope of the Lodge proposal:</p>\n<p>"I do not want to make any opposition to the Senator\'s amendment, but it occurs to me that the amendment ought to be further amended, so as to provide that it shall apply only to pipelines operated for the public.  I do not understand how you could compel a man who has a private pipeline of his own to become a common carrier. . . .  I think such a limitation ought to be put in the Senator\'s amendment by an amendment to the amendment that it shall apply to all pipelines that are carrying for the public, and not to private lines that an individual or a single corporation may have laid down and put into operation for its own benefit."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6361.</p>\n<p>Senator Nelson, in reply, stated that Foraker\'s suggestion would "practically nullify the provision, because every one of these pipelines cay say "we refuse to do business for the public."  Practically, the [Lodge] amendment would be of no use at all."  <em>Id.</em> at 6365.  And Senator Lodge added:</p>\n<p>"[T]he amendment suggested by [Senator Foraker] to the effect that no pipeline, unless it carries for the public, shall come under this rule, will, as [Senator Nelson] says, absolutely destroy the value of my amendment."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6365.</p>\n<p>During the course of the debate, an attempt was made to make the Lodge amendment applicable only to carriers "for the public" or to "transportation for hire" or "for compensation," but it was unsuccessful.  <em>Id.</em> at 7000.  Senator Lodge again stated that such an amendment would "absolutely destroy" his proposal "so far as its effectiveness is concerned." <em>Id.</em> at 7000.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt but that the proponents knew and stated their purpose.  Senator Lodge declared:</p>\n<p>"[T]he purpose of this amendment is to bring the transportation of oil and other commodities within the interstate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 341 U. S. 317</a></p><p> commerce law.  Oil is one of the greatest articles of interstate commerce carried in this country, and it is now absolutely outside and beyond any Government regulation whatsoever."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6365.  Later he added:  "All pipelines owned by any company within the United States . . . are made common carriers."  <em>Id.</em> at 7001.  Senator Clay, speaking about the pipeline provision, observed:</p>\n<p>"This bill makes every corporation engaged in the transmission of oil a common carrier.  Every private corporation transmitting its own oil . . . is made a common carrier by the [Lodge] amendment. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7009.  And Senator Culberson said:</p>\n<p>"Nothing is left to the courts for construction, but the statute itself declares that any corporation, or any person or persons, engaged in transporting oil by pipelines -- of course, as interstate commerce -- are common carriers, and are declared to be such in this act of Congress, subject to the authority of this act. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7005.  Senator Bailey, in the final debate on the measure, described the Lodge proposal as the "<em>pipeline amendment,\' by which we mean the amendment that makes the pipelines common carriers."  <em>Id.</em> at 9647.\n</em></p>\n<p>The "commodities clause" of the Hepburn Act was designed to prevent railroads from owning businesses whose shipments they carried.  When that clause was first considered in the Senate, it applied to "common carriers subject to" the Act.  Some senators realized that the "commodities clause" -- read together with the Lodge Amendment making every pipeline company subject to the Act -- would force a divorcement of pipelines from refineries.  To avoid this, they again suggested that the Lodge proposal be amended so as to apply only to pipelines operating for the public.  Senator Lodge said:</p>\n<p>"What I want to suggest to the Senator is that this [original Lodge] amendment makes the pipelines and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 341 U. S. 318</a></p><p> the oil companies subject to all the provisions of the bill.  If the Senator thinks there is an injustice, the place to remedy it is on page 5 at that amendment [the commodities clause], and not at this one [the Lodge amendment]."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 7009.  Accordingly, the "commodities clause" finally passed by Congress referred specifically to railroads.  34 Stat. 585.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
