Argued March 29, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an Interior Department agency, manages the Utah land at issue here under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA).  Pursuant to 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782, the Secretary of the Interior has identified certain federal lands as \xe2\x80\x9cwilderness study areas\xe2\x80\x9d (WSAs) and recommended some of these as suitable for wilderness designation.  Land designated as wilderness by Act of Congress enjoys special protection; until Congress acts, the Secretary must \xe2\x80\x9cmanage [WSAs] \xe2\x80\xa6 so as not to impair the[ir] suitability for preservation as wilderness.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71782(c).  In addition, each WSA or other area is managed \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d a land use plan, \xc2\xa71732(a), a BLM document which generally describes, for a particular area, allowable uses, goals for the land\xe2\x80\x99s future condition, and next steps.  43 CFR \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x935(k).  Respondents Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and others (collectively SUWA) sought declaratory and injunctive relief for BLM\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act to protect Utah public lands from environmental damage caused by off-road vehicles (ORVs), asserting three claims relevant here, and contending that they could sue under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(1).  The Tenth Circuit reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of the claims.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>BLM\xe2\x80\x99s alleged failures to act are not remediable under the APA.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0A \xc2\xa7706(1) claim can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a discrete agency action that it is required to take.  The discrete-action limitation precludes a broad programmatic attack such as that rejected in <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>National Wildlife Federation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/871/index.html">497 U. S. 871</a>, and the required-action limitation rules out judicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0SUWA first claims that BLM violated \xc2\xa71782(c)\xe2\x80\x99s nonimpairment mandate by permitting ORV use in certain WSAs.  While \xc2\xa71782(c) is mandatory as to the object to be achieved, it leaves BLM discretion to decide how to achieve that object.  SUWA argues that the nonimpairment mandate will support an APA suit, but a general deficiency in compliance lacks the requisite specificity.  The principal purpose of this limitation is to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack the expertise and information to resolve.  If courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they would necessarily be empowered to decide whether compliance was achieved.  The APA does not contemplate such pervasive federal-court oversight.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0SUWA also claims that BLM\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with provisions of its land use plans contravenes the requirement that the Secretary manage public lands in accordance with such plans, 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71732(a).  A land use plan, however, is a tool to project present and future use.  Unlike a specific statutory command requiring an agency to promulgate regulations by a certain date, a land use plan is generally a statement of priorities; it guides and restrains actions, but does not prescribe them.  A statement about what BLM plans to do, if it has funds and there are not more pressing priorities, cannot be plucked out of context and made a basis for a \xc2\xa7706(1) suit.  The land use plan statements at issue here are not a legally binding commitment enforceable under \xc2\xa7706(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0SUWA finally contends that BLM did not fulfill its obligation under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to take a \xe2\x80\x9chard look\xe2\x80\x9d at whether to supplement its environmental impact statement (EIS) to take increased ORV use into account.  Because the applicable regulation requires an EIS to be supplemented where there \xe2\x80\x9care significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts,\xe2\x80\x9d 40 CFR \xc2\xa71502.9(c)(1)(ii), an agency must take a \xe2\x80\x9chard look\xe2\x80\x9d at new information to assess the need for supplementation, <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Oregon Natural Resources Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/360/index.html">490 U. S. 360</a>, 385.  However, supplementation is required only if \xe2\x80\x9cthere remains major Federal actio[n] to occur,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 374.  Since the BLM\xe2\x80\x99s approval of its land use plan was the \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d that required the EIS; and since that plan has already been approved; there is no ongoing \xe2\x80\x9cmajor Federal action\xe2\x80\x9d that could require supplementation.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(1), extends to the review of the United States Bureau of Land Management\xe2\x80\x99s stewardship of public lands under certain statutory provisions and its own planning documents.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Almost half the State of Utah, about 23 million acres, is federal land administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), an agency within the Department of Interior.  For nearly 30 years, BLM\xe2\x80\x99s management of public lands has been governed by the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), 90 Stat. 2744, 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701 <em>et seq.</em>, which \xe2\x80\x9cestablished a policy in favor of retaining public lands for multiple use management.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>National Wildlife Federation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/871/index.html"></a><a href="/us/497/871/index.html">497 U. S. 871</a>, 877 (1990).  \xe2\x80\x9cMultiple use management\xe2\x80\x9d is a deceptively simple term that describes the enormously complicated task of striking a balance among the many competing uses to which land can be put, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding, but not limited to, recreation, range, timber, minerals, watershed, wildlife and fish, and [uses serving] natural scenic, scientific and historical values.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71702(c).  A second management goal, \xe2\x80\x9csustained yield,\xe2\x80\x9d requires BLM to control depleting uses over time, so as to ensure a high level of valuable uses in the future.  \xc2\xa71702(h).  To these ends, FLPMA establishes a dual regime of inventory and planning.  Sections 1711 and 1712, respectively, provide for a comprehensive, ongoing inventory of federal lands, and for a land use planning process that \xe2\x80\x9cproject[s]\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpresent and future use,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71701(a)(2), given the lands\xe2\x80\x99 inventoried characteristics.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course not all uses are compatible.  Congress made the judgment that some lands should be set aside as wilderness at the expense of commercial and recreational uses.  A pre-FLPMA enactment, the Wilderness Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 890, provides that designated wilderness areas, subject to certain exceptions, \xe2\x80\x9cshall [have] no commercial enterprise and no permanent road,\xe2\x80\x9d no motorized vehicles, and no manmade structures.  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71133(c).  The designation of a wilderness area can be made only by Act of Congress, see 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pursuant to \xc2\xa71782, the Secretary of the Interior has identified so-called \xe2\x80\x9cwilderness study areas\xe2\x80\x9d (WSAs), roadless lands of 5,000 acres or more that possess \xe2\x80\x9cwilderness characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d as determined in the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s land inventory.  \xc2\xa71782(a); see 16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71131(c).  As the name suggests, WSAs (as well as certain wild lands identified prior to the passage of FLPMA) have been subjected to further examination and public comment in order to evaluate their suitability for designation as wilderness.  In 1991, out of 3.3 million acres in Utah that had been identified for study, 2 million were recommended as suitable for wilderness designation.  1 U. S. Dept. of Interior, BLM, Utah Statewide Wilderness Study Report 3 (Oct. 1991).  This recommendation was forwarded to Congress, which has not yet acted upon it.  Until Congress acts one way or the other, FLPMA provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary shall continue to manage such lands . . . in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(c).  This nonimpairment mandate applies to all WSAs identified under \xc2\xa71782, including lands considered unsuitable by the Secretary.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71782(a), (b); App. 64 (BLM Interim Management Policy for Lands Under Wilderness Review).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aside from identification of WSAs, the main tool that BLM employs to balance wilderness protection against other uses is a land use plan\xe2\x80\x94what BLM regulations call a \xe2\x80\x9cresource management plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 CFR \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x935(k) (2003).  Land use plans, adopted after notice and comment, are \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to guide and control future management actions,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x932.  See 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71712; 43 CFR \xc2\xa71610.2 (2003).  Generally, a land use plan describes, for a particular area, allowable uses, goals for future condition of the land, and specific next steps.  \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x935(k).  Under FLPMA, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary shall manage the public lands under principles of multiple use and sustained yield, in accordance with the land use plans \xe2\x80\xa6 when they are available.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71732(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Protection of wilderness has come into increasing conflict with another element of multiple use, recreational use of so-called off-road vehicles (ORVs), which include vehicles primarily designed for off-road use, such as lightweight, four-wheel \xe2\x80\x9call-terrain vehicles,\xe2\x80\x9d and vehicles capable of such use, such as sport utility vehicles.  See 43 CFR \xc2\xa78340.0\xe2\x80\x935(a) (2003).  According to the United\xc2\xa0States Forest Service\xe2\x80\x99s most recent estimates, some 42 million Americans participate in off-road travel each year, more than double the number two decades ago.  H. Cordell, Outdoor Recreation for 21st Century America 40 (2004).  United States sales of all-terrain vehicles alone have roughly doubled in the past five years, reaching almost 900,000 in 2003.  See Tanz, Making Tracks, Making Enemies, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Jan. 2, 2004, p. F1, col. 5; Discover Today\xe2\x80\x99s Motorcycling, Motorcycle Industry Council, Press Release, Feb. 13, 2004, http://www.motorcycles.org (all Internet materials as visited June 4, 2004, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The use of ORVs on federal land has negative environmental consequences, including soil disruption and compaction, harassment of animals, and annoyance of wilderness lovers.  See Brief for Natural Resources Defense Council et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 4\xe2\x80\x937, and studies cited therein.  Thus, BLM faces a classic land use dilemma of sharply inconsistent uses, in a context of scarce resources and congressional silence with respect to wilderness designation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1999, respondents Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance and other organizations (collectively SUWA) filed this action in the United States District Court for Utah against petitioners BLM, its Director, and the Secretary.  In its second amended complaint, SUWA sought declaratory and injunctive relief for BLM\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act to protect public lands in Utah from damage caused by ORV use.  SUWA made three claims that are relevant here: (1) that BLM had violated its nonimpairment obligation under \xc2\xa71782(a) by allowing degradation in certain WSAs; (2) that BLM had failed to implement provisions in its land use plans relating to ORV use; (3) that BLM had failed to take a \xe2\x80\x9chard look\xe2\x80\x9d at whether, pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. 852, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74321 <em>et seq</em>., it should undertake supplemental environmental analyses for areas in which ORV use had increased.  SUWA contended that it could sue to remedy these three failures to act pursuant to the APA\xe2\x80\x99s provision of a cause of action to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court entered a dismissal with respect to the three claims.  A divided panel of the Tenth Circuit reversed.  301 F.\xc2\xa03d 1217 (2002).  The majority acknowledged that under \xc2\xa7706(1), \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts may order agencies to act only where the agency fails to carry out a mandatory, nondiscretionary duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1226.  It concluded, however, that BLM\xe2\x80\x99s nonimpairment obligation was just such a duty, and therefore BLM could be compelled to comply.  Under similar reasoning, it reversed the dismissal with respect to the land use plan claim; and likewise reversed dismissal of the NEPA claim.  We granted certiorari.  <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/980/index.html">540 U. S. 980</a> (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0All three claims at issue here involve assertions that BLM failed to take action with respect to ORV use that it was required to take.  Failures to act are sometimes remediable under the APA, but not always.  We begin by considering what limits the APA places upon judicial review of agency inaction.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The APA authorizes suit by \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person suffering legal wrong because of agency action, or adversely affected or aggrieved by agency action within the meaning of a relevant statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7702.  Where no other statute provides a private right of action, the \xe2\x80\x9cagency action\xe2\x80\x9d complained of must be \xe2\x80\x9c<em>final </em>agency action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7704 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cAgency action\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in \xc2\xa7551(13) to include \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole or a part of an agency rule, order, license, sanction, relief, or the equivalent or denial thereof, <em>or failure to act.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The APA provides relief for a failure to act in \xc2\xa7706(1): \xe2\x80\x9cThe reviewing court shall \xe2\x80\xa6 compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably delayed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sections 702, 704, and 706(1) all insist upon an \xe2\x80\x9cagency action,\xe2\x80\x9d either as the action complained of (in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7702 and 704) or as the action to be compelled (in \xc2\xa7706(1)).  The definition of that term begins with a list of five categories of decisions made or outcomes implemented by an agency\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cagency rule, order, license, sanction [or] relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7551(13).  All of those categories involve circumscribed, discrete agency actions, as their definitions make clear: \xe2\x80\x9can agency statement of \xe2\x80\xa6 future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy\xe2\x80\x9d (rule); \xe2\x80\x9ca final disposition \xe2\x80\xa6 in a matter other than rule making\xe2\x80\x9d (order); a \xe2\x80\x9cpermit \xe2\x80\xa6 or other form of permission\xe2\x80\x9d (license); a \xe2\x80\x9cprohibition \xe2\x80\xa6 or taking [of] other compulsory or restrictive action\xe2\x80\x9d (sanction); or a \xe2\x80\x9cgrant of money, assistance, license, authority,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., or \xe2\x80\x9crecognition of a claim, right, immunity,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., or \xe2\x80\x9ctaking of other action on the application or petition of, and beneficial to, a person\xe2\x80\x9d (relief).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7551(4), (6), (8), (10), (11).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms following those five categories of agency action are not defined in the APA: \xe2\x80\x9cor the equivalent or denial thereof, or failure to act.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7551(13).  But an \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent \xe2\x80\xa6 thereof\xe2\x80\x9d must also be discrete (or it would not be equivalent), and a \xe2\x80\x9cdenial thereof\xe2\x80\x9d must be the denial of a discrete listed action (and perhaps denial of a discrete equivalent).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final term in the definition, \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to act,\xe2\x80\x9d is in our view properly understood as a failure to take an <em>agency action</em>\xe2\x80\x94that is, a failure to take one of the agency actions (including their equivalents) earlier defined in \xc2\xa7551(13).  Moreover, even without this equation of \xe2\x80\x9cact\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cagency action\xe2\x80\x9d the interpretive canon of <em>ejusdem generis</em> would attribute to the last item (\xe2\x80\x9cfailure to act\xe2\x80\x9d) the same characteristic of discreteness shared by all the preceding items.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs.</em> v.<em> Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/537/371/index.html">537 U. S. 371</a>, 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (2003).  A \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to act\xe2\x80\x9d is not the same thing as a \xe2\x80\x9cdenial.\xe2\x80\x9d  The latter is the agency\xe2\x80\x99s act of saying no to a request; the former is simply the omission of an action without formally rejecting a request\xe2\x80\x94for example, the failure to promulgate a rule or take some decision by a statutory deadline.  The important point is that a \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to act\xe2\x80\x9d is properly understood to be limited, as are the other items in \xc2\xa7551(13), to a <em>discrete </em>action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second point central to the analysis of the present case is that the only agency action that can be compelled under the APA is action legally <em>required</em>.  This limitation appears in \xc2\xa7706(1)\xe2\x80\x99s authorization for courts to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel agency action <em>unlawfully </em>withheld.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In this regard the APA carried forward the traditional practice prior to its passage, when judicial review was achieved through use of the so-called prerogative writs\xe2\x80\x94principally writs of mandamus under the All Writs Act, now codified at 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71651(a).  The mandamus remedy was normally limited to enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9ca specific, unequivocal command,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ICC</em> v. <em>New York, N. H. &amp; H. R.

As described in the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on the APA, a document whose reasoning we have often found persuasive, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Darby</em> v. <em>Cisneros,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/137/index.html">509 U.

S. 281</a>, 302, n. 31 (1979); <em>Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/519/index.html">435 U. S. 519</a>, 546 (1978), \xc2\xa7706(1) empowers a court only to compel an agency \xe2\x80\x9cto perform a ministerial or non-discretionary act,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>or \xe2\x80\x9cto take action upon a matter, without directing <em>how</em> it shall act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on the Administrative Procedure Act 108 (1947) (emphasis added).  See also L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 372 (1965); K. Davis, Administrative Law \xc2\xa7257, p. 925 (1951).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, a claim under \xc2\xa7706(1) can proceed only where a plaintiff asserts that an agency failed to take a <em>discrete </em>agency action that it is <em>required to take</em>.  These limitations rule out several kinds of challenges.  The limitation to discrete agency action precludes the kind of broad programmatic attack we rejected in <em>Lujan</em> v. <em>National Wildlife Federation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/871/index.html"></a><a href="/us/497/871/index.html">497 U.

There we considered a challenge to BLM\xe2\x80\x99s land withdrawal review program, couched as unlawful agency \xe2\x80\x9caction\xe2\x80\x9d that the plaintiffs wished to have \xe2\x80\x9cset aside\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7706(2).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at 879.

Under the terms of the APA, respondent must direct its attack against some particular<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x98agency action\xe2\x80\x99 that causes it harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 891 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe plaintiffs in <em>National Wildlife Federation</em> would have fared no better if they had characterized the agency\xe2\x80\x99s alleged \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to revise land use plans in proper fashion\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to consider multiple use,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cagency action unlawfully withheld\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7706(1), rather than agency action \xe2\x80\x9cnot in accordance with law\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7706(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The limitation to <em>required</em> agency action rules out judicial direction of even discrete agency action that is not demanded by law (which includes, of course, agency regulations that have the force of law).  Thus, when an agency is compelled by law to act within a certain time period, but the manner of its action is left to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion, a court can compel the agency to act, but has no power to specify what the action must be.  For example, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7251(d)(1), which required the Federal Communications Commission \xe2\x80\x9cto establish regulations to implement\xe2\x80\x9d interconnection requirements \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithin 6 months\xe2\x80\x9d of the date of enactment of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, would have supported a judicial decree under the APA requiring the prompt issuance of regulations, but not a judicial decree setting forth the content of those regulations.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these principles in mind, we turn to SUWA\xe2\x80\x99s first claim, that by permitting ORV use in certain WSAs, BLM violated its mandate to \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue to manage [WSAs] \xe2\x80\xa6 in a manner so as not to impair the suitability of such areas for preservation as wilderness,\xe2\x80\x9d 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71782(c).  SUWA relies not only upon \xc2\xa71782(c) but also upon a provision of BLM\xe2\x80\x99s Interim Management Policy for Lands Under Wilderness Review, which interprets the nonimpairment mandate to require BLM to manage WSAs so as to prevent them from being \xe2\x80\x9cdegraded so far, compared with the area\xe2\x80\x99s values for other purposes, as to significantly constrain the Congress\xe2\x80\x99s prerogative to either designate [it] as wilderness or release it for other uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 65.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 1782(c) is mandatory as to the object to be achieved, but it leaves BLM a great deal of discretion in deciding how to achieve it.  It assuredly does not mandate, with the clarity necessary to support judicial action under \xc2\xa7706(1), the total exclusion of ORV use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SUWA argues that \xc2\xa71782 <em>does</em> contain a categorical imperative, namely the command to comply with the nonimpairment mandate.  It contends that a federal court could simply enter a general order compelling compliance with that mandate, without suggesting any particular manner of compliance.  It relies upon the language from the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s Manual quoted earlier, that a court can \xe2\x80\x9ctake action upon a matter, without directing how [the agency] shall act,\xe2\x80\x9d and upon language in a case cited by the Manual noting that \xe2\x80\x9cmandamus will lie \xe2\x80\xa6 even though the act required involves the exercise of judgment and discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Safeway Stores </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, 138 F.\xc2\xa02d 278, 280 (Emerg. Ct. App. 1943).  The action referred to in these excerpts, however, is <em>discrete</em> agency action, as we have discussed above.  General deficiencies in compliance, unlike the failure to issue a ruling that was discussed in <em>Safeway Stores</em>, lack the specificity requisite for agency action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal purpose of the APA limitations we have discussed\xe2\x80\x94and of the traditional limitations upon mandamus from which they were derived\xe2\x80\x94is to protect agencies from undue judicial interference with their lawful discretion, and to avoid judicial entanglement in abstract policy disagreements which courts lack both expertise and information to resolve.  If courts were empowered to enter general orders compelling compliance with broad statutory mandates, they would necessarily be empowered, as well, to determine whether compliance was achieved\xe2\x80\x94which would mean that it would ultimately become the task of the supervising court, rather than the agency, to work out compliance with the broad statutory mandate, injecting the judge into day-to-day agency management.  To take just a few examples from federal resources management, a plaintiff might allege that the Secretary had failed to \xe2\x80\x9cmanage wild free-roaming horses and burros in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cmanage the [New Orleans Jazz National] [H]istorical [P]ark in such a manner as will preserve and perpetuate knowledge and understanding of the history of jazz,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cmanage the [Steens Mountain] Cooperative Management and Protection Area for the benefit of present and future generations.\xe2\x80\x9d  16 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71333(a), 410bbb\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1), 460nnn\xe2\x80\x9312(b).  The prospect of pervasive oversight by federal courts over the manner and pace of agency compliance with such congressional directives is not contemplated by the APA.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SUWA\xe2\x80\x99s second claim is that BLM failed to comply with certain provisions in its land use plans, thus contravening the requirement that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary shall manage the public lands \xe2\x80\xa6 in accordance with the land use plans \xe2\x80\xa6 when they are available.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71732(a); see also 43 CFR \xc2\xa71610.5\xe2\x80\x933(a) (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll future resource management authorizations and actions \xe2\x80\xa6 and subsequent more detailed or specific planning, shall conform to the approved plan\xe2\x80\x9d).  The relevant count in SUWA\xe2\x80\x99s second amended complaint alleged that BLM had violated a variety of commitments in its land use plans, but over the course of the litigation these have been reduced to two, one relating to the 1991 resource management plan for the San Rafael area, and the other to various aspects of the 1990 ORV implementation plan for the Henry Mountains area.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The actions contemplated by the first of these alleged commitments (completion of a route designation plan in the San Rafael area), and by one aspect of the second (creation of \xe2\x80\x9cuse supervision files\xe2\x80\x9d for designated areas in the Henry Mountains area) have already been completed,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and these claims are therefore moot.  There remains the claim, with respect to the Henry Mountains plan, that \xe2\x80\x9cin light of damage from ORVs in the Factory Butte area,\xe2\x80\x9d a sub-area of Henry Mountains open to ORV use, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [plan] obligated BLM to conduct an intensive ORV monitoring program.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for SUWA 7\xe2\x80\x938.  This claim is based upon the plan\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the Factory Butte area \xe2\x80\x9cwill be monitored and closed if warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 140.  SUWA does not contest BLM\xe2\x80\x99s assertion in the court below that informal monitoring has taken place for some years, see Brief for Appellee Secretary of Interior et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 01\xe2\x80\x934009 (CA10), p. 23, but it demands continuing implementation of a monitoring <em>program</em>.  By this it apparently means to insist upon adherence to the plan\xe2\x80\x99s general discussion of \xe2\x80\x9cUse Supervision and Monitoring\xe2\x80\x9d in designated areas, App. 148\xe2\x80\x93149, which (in addition to calling for the use supervision files that have already been created) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]esource damage will be documented and recommendations made for corrective action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[m]onitoring in open areas will focus on determining damage which may necessitate a change in designation,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemphasis on use supervision will be placed on [limited and closed areas].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 149.  SUWA acknowledges that a monitoring program has recently been <em>commenced</em>.  Brief for SUWA 12.  In light, however, of the continuing action that existence of a \xe2\x80\x9cprogram\xe2\x80\x9d contemplates, and in light of BLM\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the program cannot be compelled under \xc2\xa7706(1), this claim cannot be considered moot.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory directive that BLM manage \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d land use plans, and the regulatory requirement that authorizations and actions \xe2\x80\x9cconform to\xe2\x80\x9d those plans, prevent BLM from taking actions inconsistent with the provisions of a land use plan.  Unless and until the plan is amended, such actions can be set aside as contrary to law pursuant to 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7706(2).  The claim presently under discussion, however, would have us go further, and conclude that a statement in a plan that BLM \xe2\x80\x9cwill\xe2\x80\x9d take this, that, or the other action, is a binding commitment that can be compelled under \xc2\xa7706(1).  In our view it is not\xe2\x80\x94at least absent clear indication of binding commitment in the terms of the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0FLPMA describes land use plans as tools by which \xe2\x80\x9cpresent and future use is <em>projected</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71701(a)(2) (emphasis added).  The implementing regulations make clear that land use plans are a preliminary step in the overall process of managing public lands\xe2\x80\x94\n\xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to guide and control future management actions and the development of subsequent, more detailed and limited scope plans for resources and uses.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 CFR \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x932 (2003).  The statute and regulations confirm that a land use plan is not ordinarily the medium for affirmative decisions that implement the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproject[ions].\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Title 43 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71712(e) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary may issue management decisions to implement land use plans\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the decisions, that is, are distinct from the plan itself.  Picking up the same theme, the regulation defining a land use plan declares that a plan \xe2\x80\x9cis not a final implementation decision on actions which require further specific plans, process steps, or decisions under specific provisions of law and regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 CFR \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x935(k) (2003).  The BLM\xe2\x80\x99s Land Use Planning Handbook specifies that land use plans are normally not used to make site-specific implementation decisions.  See Handbook II\xe2\x80\x932.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plans also receive a different agency review process from implementation decisions.  Appeal to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s Board of Land Appeals is available for \xe2\x80\x9ca specific action being proposed to implement some portion of a resource management plan or amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  43 CFR \xc2\xa71610.5\xe2\x80\x933(b).  However, the Board, which reviews \xe2\x80\x9cdecisions rendered by Departmental officials relating to \xe2\x80\xa6 [t]he use and disposition of public lands and their resources,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa74.1(b)(3)(i), does not review the approval of a plan, since it regards a plan as a policy determination, not an implementation decision.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wilderness Society</em>, 109 I.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0A. 175, 178 (1989); <em>Wilderness Society</em>, 90 I.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0A. 221, 224 (1986); see also Handbook II\xe2\x80\x932, IV\xe2\x80\x933.  Plans are protested to the BLM director, not appealed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The San Rafael plan provides an apt illustration of the immense scope of projected activity that a land use plan can embrace.  Over 100 pages in length, it presents a comprehensive management framework for 1.5 million acres of BLM-administered land.  Twenty categories of resource management are separately discussed, including mineral extraction, wilderness protection, livestock grazing, preservation of cultural resources, and recreation.  The plan lays out an ambitious agenda for the preparation of additional, more detailed plans and specific next steps for implementation.  Its introduction notes that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n [ORV] implementation plan is scheduled to be prepared within 1 year following approval of the [San Rafael plan].\xe2\x80\x9d  San Rafael Plan 9.  Similarly \xe2\x80\x9cscheduled for preparation\xe2\x80\x9d are activity plans for certain environmentally sensitive areas, \xe2\x80\x9calong with allotment management plans, habitat management plans, a fire management plan, recreation management plans \xe2\x80\xa6, cultural resource management plans for selected sites, watershed activity plans, and the wild and scenic river management plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The projected schedule set forth in the plan shows \xe2\x80\x9c[a]nticipated [i]mplementation\xe2\x80\x9d of some future plans within one year, others within three years, and still others, such as certain recreation and cultural resource management plans, at a pace of \xe2\x80\x9cone study per fiscal year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95\xe2\x80\x93102.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Quite unlike a specific statutory command requiring an agency to promulgate regulations by a certain date, a land use plan is generally a statement of priorities; it guides and constrains actions, but does not (at least in the usual case) prescribe them.  It would be unreasonable to think that either Congress or the agency intended otherwise, since land use plans nationwide would commit the agency to actions far in the future, for which funds have not yet been appropriated.  Some plans make explicit that implementation of their programmatic content is subject to budgetary constraints.  See Brief for Petitioners 42\xe2\x80\x9343, and n.\xc2\xa018 (quoting from such plans).  While the Henry Mountains plan does not contain such a specification, we think it must reasonably be implied.  A statement by BLM about what it plans to do, at some point, provided it has the funds and there are not more pressing priorities, cannot be plucked out of context and made a basis for suit under \xc2\xa7706(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, an action called for in a plan may be compelled when the plan merely reiterates duties the agency is already obligated to perform, or perhaps when language in the plan itself creates a commitment binding on the agency.  But allowing general enforcement of plan terms would lead to pervasive interference with BLM\xe2\x80\x99s own ordering of priorities.  For example, a judicial decree compelling immediate preparation of all of the detailed plans called for in the San Rafael plan would divert BLM\xe2\x80\x99s energies from other projects throughout the country that are in fact more pressing.  And while such a decree might please the environmental plaintiffs in the present case, it would ultimately operate to the detriment of sound environmental management.  Its predictable consequence would be much vaguer plans from BLM in the future\xe2\x80\x94making coordination with other agencies more difficult, and depriving the public of important information concerning the agency\xe2\x80\x99s long-range intentions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore hold that the Henry Mountains plan\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the effect that BLM will conduct \xe2\x80\x9cuse supervision and monitoring\xe2\x80\x9d in designated areas\xe2\x80\x94like other \xe2\x80\x9cwill do\xe2\x80\x9d projections of agency action set forth in land use plans\xe2\x80\x94are not a legally binding commitment enforceable under \xc2\xa7706(1).  That being so, we find it unnecessary to consider whether the action envisioned by the statements is sufficiently discrete to be amenable to compulsion under the APA.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we turn to SUWA\xe2\x80\x99s contention that BLM failed to fulfill certain obligations under NEPA.  Before addressing whether a NEPA-required duty is actionable under the APA, we must decide whether NEPA creates an obligation in the first place.  NEPA requires a federal agency to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) as part of any \xe2\x80\x9cproposals for legislation and other major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74332(2)(C).  Often an initial EIS is sufficient, but in certain circumstances an EIS must be supplemented.  See <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Oregon Natural Resources Council,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/360/index.html">490 U. S. 360</a>, 370\xe2\x80\x93374 (1989).  A regulation of the Council on Environmental Quality requires supplementation where \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here are significant new circumstances or information relevant to environmental concerns and bearing on the proposed action or its impacts.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa71502.9(c)(1)(ii) (2003).  In <em>Marsh</em>, we interpreted \xc2\xa74332 in light of this regulation to require an agency to take a \xe2\x80\x9chard look\xe2\x80\x9d at the new information to assess whether supplementation might be necessary.  490 U. S., at 385; see <em>id.</em>, at 378\xe2\x80\x93385.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SUWA argues that evidence of increased ORV use is \xe2\x80\x9csignificant new circumstances or information\xe2\x80\x9d that requires a \xe2\x80\x9chard look.\xe2\x80\x9d  We disagree.  As we noted in <em>Marsh</em>, supplementation is necessary only if \xe2\x80\x9cthere remains \xe2\x80\x98major Federal actio[n]\xe2\x80\x99 to occur,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in \xc2\xa74332(2)(C).  490 U. S., at 374.  In <em>Marsh</em>, that condition was met: the dam construction project that gave rise to environmental review was not yet completed.  Here, by contrast, although the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[a]pproval </em>of a [land use plan]\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cmajor Federal action\xe2\x80\x9d requiring an EIS, 43 CFR \xc2\xa71601.0\xe2\x80\x936 (2003) (emphasis added), that action is completed when the plan is approved.  The land use plan is the \xe2\x80\x9cproposed action\xe2\x80\x9d contemplated by the regulation.  There is no ongoing \xe2\x80\x9cmajor Federal action\xe2\x80\x9d that could require supplementation (though BLM <em>is</em> required to perform additional NEPA analyses if a plan is amended or revised, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71610.5\xe2\x80\x935, 5\xe2\x80\x936).</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course \xc2\xa7706(1) also authorizes courts to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel agency action \xe2\x80\xa6 unreasonably delayed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but a delay cannot be unreasonable with respect to action that is not required.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Title 5 U.
