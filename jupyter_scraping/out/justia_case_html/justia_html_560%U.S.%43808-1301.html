UNITED STATES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">CARR <em>v</em>. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931301.\xe2\x80\x83Argued February 24, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 1, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Enacted in 2006, the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA) makes it a federal crime for, <em>inter alia,</em> any person (1) who \xe2\x80\x9cis required to register under [SORNA],\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d to (3) \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly fai[l] to register or update a registration,\xe2\x80\x9d 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a).  Before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, petitioner Carr, a registered sex offender in Alabama, relocated to Indiana without complying with the latter State\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  Carr was indicted under \xc2\xa72250 post-SORNA.  The Federal District Court denied Carr\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, which asserted that the \xc2\xa72250 prosecution would violate the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause because he had traveled to Indiana before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  Carr then pleaded guilty and was sentenced to prison.  Affirming the conviction, the Seventh Circuit held that \xc2\xa72250 does not require that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s travel postdate SORNA and that reliance on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pre-SORNA travel poses no <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto </em>problem so long as the defendant had a reasonable time to register post-SORNA but failed to do so, as had Carr.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Section 2250 does not apply to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xc2\xa72250(a) requires a sex-offense conviction, subsequent interstate travel, and then a failure to register, and that only the last of these events must occur after SORNA took effect.  The Court instead accepts Carr\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation that the statute does not impose liability unless a person, after becoming subject to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements, travels across state lines and then fails to register.  That interpretation better accords with \xc2\xa72250(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, the first element of which can only be satisfied when a person \xe2\x80\x9cis required to register under SORNA.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72250(a)(1).  That \xc2\xa72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense (\xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than in the past or present perfect (\xe2\x80\x9ctraveled\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chas traveled\xe2\x80\x9d) reinforces this conclusion.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/329/index.html">503 U. S. 329</a>, 333.  And because the Dictionary Act\xe2\x80\x99s provision that statutory \xe2\x80\x9cwords used in the present tense include the future as well as the present,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71, implies that the present tense generally does not include the past, regulating a person who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect.  Indeed, there appears to be no instance in which this Court has construed a present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.  The statutory context also supports a forward-looking construction of \xe2\x80\x9ctravels.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d is followed in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) by a series of other present tense verbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9centers or leaves, or resides.\xe2\x80\x9d  A statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundeviating use of the present tense\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cstriking indic[ator]\xe2\x80\x9d of its \xe2\x80\x9cprospective orientation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/49/index.html">484 U. S. 49</a>, 59.  Second, the other elements of a \xc2\xa72250 violation are similarly set forth in the present tense: Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who \xe2\x80\x9c<em>is</em> required to register under [SORNA]\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly <em>fails</em> to register or update a registration.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy \xc2\xa72250\xe2\x80\x99s first two requirements but not the third, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses, as it has in numerous other federal statutes.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover pre-SORNA travel are unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The claim that such a reading avoids an \xe2\x80\x9canomaly\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders is rejected.  Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of a conviction under Federal law \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under SORNA who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B).  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdictional reach should have comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders is little more than <em>ipse dixit</em>.  It is entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements by federal sex offenders, who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.  It is similarly reasonable for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, they use interstate commerce channels to evade a State\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  The Seventh Circuit erred in analogizing \xc2\xa72250 to 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from \xe2\x80\x9cpossess[ing] in \xe2\x80\xa6 commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to the lower court, \xc2\xa72250(a), like \xc2\xa7922(g), uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element to establish a constitutional predicate for the statute, not to create a temporal requirement.  However, the proper analogy here is not between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm, but between the sex offender who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d and the convicted felon who \xe2\x80\x9cpossesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for \xc2\xa72250, but it is also, like the act of possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Also unavailing is the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of one of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, to locate sex offenders who failed to abide by their registration obligations.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument confuses SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s general goal with \xc2\xa72250\xe2\x80\x99s specific purpose.  Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.  By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these other provisions, not \xc2\xa72250, stand at the center of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to account for missing sex offenders.  While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under \xc2\xa72250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.  Taking account of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure, there is little reason to doubt that Congress intended \xc2\xa72250 to do exactly what it says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evidence of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose calls this reading into question.  To the contrary, the House Judiciary Committee\xe2\x80\x99s Report suggests not only that a prohibition on postenactment travel is consonant with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 goals, but also that it is the rule Congress in fact chose to adopt.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Because \xc2\xa72250 liability cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel, the Court need not address whether the statute violates the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause.

In an effort to make these state schemes more comprehensive, uniform, and effective, Congress in 2006 enacted the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) as part of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, Pub. L. 109\xe2\x80\x93248, Tit. I, 120 Stat. 590.  Among its provisions, the Act established a federal criminal offense covering, <em>inter alia</em>, any person who (1) \xe2\x80\x9cis required to register under [SORNA],\xe2\x80\x9d (2) \xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly fails to register or update a registration.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a).  At issue in this case is whether \xc2\xa72250 applies to sex offenders whose interstate travel occurred prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date and, if so, whether the statute runs afoul of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto </em>laws.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl. 3.  Liability under \xc2\xa72250, we hold, cannot be predicated on pre-SORNA travel.  We therefore do not address the <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto\n</em>question.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In May 2004, petitioner Thomas Carr pleaded guilty in Alabama state court to first-degree sexual abuse.  He was sentenced to 15 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, with all but two years suspended.  Receiving credit for time previously served, Carr was released on probation on July 3, 2004, and he registered as a sex offender as required by Alabama law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In late 2004 or early 2005, prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Carr relocated from Alabama to Indiana.  He did not comply with Indiana\xe2\x80\x99s sex-offender registration requirements.  In July 2007, Carr came to the attention of law enforcement in Fort Wayne, Indiana, following his involvement in a fight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 22, 2007, federal prosecutors filed an indictment in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Indiana charging Carr with failing to register in violation of \xc2\xa72250.  Carr moved to dismiss the indictment, asserting that because he traveled to Indiana prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, it would violate the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause to prosecute him under \xc2\xa72250.  The District Court denied Carr\xe2\x80\x99s motion, and Carr entered a conditional guilty plea, preserving his right to appeal.  He received a 30-month prison sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit consolidated Carr\xe2\x80\x99s appeal with that of a similarly situated defendant, who, in addition to raising an <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto</em> claim, asserted that \xc2\xa72250, by its terms, does not apply to persons whose interstate travel preceded SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Beginning with the statutory argument, the Court of Appeals held that \xc2\xa72250 \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s travel postdate the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 578, 582 (2008).  The court relied principally on its understanding of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s underlying purpose:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe evil at which [the Act] is aimed is that convicted sex offenders registered in one state might move to another state, fail to register there, and thus leave the public unprotected.  The concern is as acute in a case in which the offender moved before the Act was passed as in one in which he moved afterward.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe court drew an analogy to 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g), which prohibits convicted felons from \xe2\x80\x9cpossess[ing] in or affecting commerc[e] any firearm or ammunition.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cThe danger posed by such a felon is unaffected by when the gun crossed state lines \xe2\x80\xa6 , and so it need not have crossed after the statute was passed.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582 (citing <em>Scarborough</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/563/index.html">431 U. S. 563</a> (1977)).  According to the court, \xc2\xa72250(a), like \xc2\xa7922(g), uses movement in interstate commerce as a jurisdictional element \xe2\x80\x9cto establish a constitutional predicate for the statute \xe2\x80\xa6 rather than to create a temporal requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reading \xc2\xa72250 to encompass pre-SORNA travel, the Seventh Circuit recognized, created a conflict with the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Husted</em>, 545 F.\xc2\xa03d 1240 (2008).  In holding that \xc2\xa72250\xe2\x80\x99s coverage \xe2\x80\x9cis limited to those individuals who travel in interstate commerce after the Act\xe2\x80\x99s effective date,\xe2\x80\x9d the Tenth Circuit emphasized \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99s use of the present tense form of the verb \xe2\x80\x98to travel\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 , which according to ordinary English grammar, does not refer to travel that has already occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1243\xe2\x80\x931244.  Rejecting this analysis, the Seventh Circuit characterized Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of tenses as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not very revealing.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583 (quoting <em>Scarborough</em>, 431 U. S., at 571).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having dispensed with the statutory question, the Seventh Circuit considered the claim of Carr and his co-appellant that predicating a \xc2\xa72250 prosecution on pre-SORNA travel violates the <em>Ex\xc2\xa0Post Facto </em>Clause.  Reliance on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pre-SORNA travel, the court concluded, poses no <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto </em>problem so long as the defendant had \xe2\x80\x9creasonable time\xe2\x80\x9d to register after SORNA took effect but failed to do so.  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 585.  Noting that Carr remained unregistered five months after SORNA became applicable to him, the Seventh Circuit affirmed his conviction.  <em>Id</em>., at 586\xe2\x80\x93587.  The court reversed the conviction of Carr\xe2\x80\x99s co-appellant, finding that he had not been given a sufficient grace period to register.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of the division among the Circuits as to the meaning of \xc2\xa72250\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctravel\xe2\x80\x9d requirement,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] we granted certiorari, 557 U.

A sequential reading, the parties recognize, helps to assure a nexus between a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s interstate travel and his failure to register as a sex offender.  Persons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their State of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \xc2\xa72250 even if they had not left the State after being convicted\xe2\x80\x94an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While both parties accept that the elements of \xc2\xa72250 should be read sequentially, they disagree on the event that sets the sequence in motion.  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, the statute is triggered by a sex-offense conviction, which must be followed by interstate travel, and then a failure to register under SORNA.  Only the last of these events, the Government maintains, must occur after SORNA took effect; the predicate conviction and the travel may both have predated the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Carr, in contrast, asserts that the statutory sequence begins when a person becomes subject to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  The person must then travel in interstate commerce and thereafter fail to register.  All of these events, Carr avers, necessarily postdate SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment because a sex offender could not have been required to register under SORNA until SORNA became the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Carr\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation better accords with the statutory text.  By its terms, the first element of \xc2\xa72250(a) can only be satisfied when a person \xe2\x80\x9cis required to register <em>under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72250(a)(1) (emphasis added).  In an attempt to reconcile its preferred construction with the words of the statute, the Government insists that this language is merely \xe2\x80\x9ca shorthand way of identifying those persons who have a [sex-offense] conviction in the classes identified by SORNA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  To reach this conclusion, the Government observes that another provision of SORNA, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(a), states that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements apply to \xe2\x80\x9csex offender[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  A \xe2\x80\x9csex offender\xe2\x80\x9d is elsewhere defined as \xe2\x80\x9can individual who was convicted of a sex offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716911(1).  Thus, as the Government would have it, Congress used 12 words and two implied cross-references to establish that the first element of \xc2\xa72250(a) is that a person has been convicted of a sex offense.  Such contortions can scarcely be called \xe2\x80\x9cshorthand.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is far more sensible to conclude that Congress meant the first precondition to \xc2\xa72250 liability to be the one it listed first: a \xe2\x80\x9crequire[ment] to register under [SORNA].\xe2\x80\x9d  Once a person becomes subject to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements, which can occur only after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, that person can be convicted under \xc2\xa72250 if he thereafter travels and then fails to register.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That \xc2\xa72250 sets forth the travel requirement in the present tense (\xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than in the past or present perfect (\xe2\x80\x9ctraveled\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chas traveled\xe2\x80\x9d) reinforces the conclusion that preenactment travel falls outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s compass. Consistent with normal usage, we have frequently looked to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of verb tense to ascertain a statute\xe2\x80\x99s temporal reach.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/329/index.html">503 U. S. 329</a>, 333 (1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 use of a verb tense is significant in construing statutes\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd.</em> v. <em>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/49/index.html">484 U. S. 49</a>, 57 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress could have phrased its requirement in language that looked to the past \xe2\x80\xa6 , but it did not choose this readily available option\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Barrett</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/212/index.html">423 U. S. 212</a>, 216 (1976) (observing that Congress used the present perfect tense to \xe2\x80\x9cdenot[e] an act that has been completed\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Dictionary Act also ascribes significance to verb tense.  It provides that, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, unless the context indicates otherwise[,] \xe2\x80\xa6 words used in the present tense include the future as well as the present.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  By implication, then, the Dictionary Act instructs that the present tense generally does not include the past.  Accordingly, a statute that regulates a person who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d is not readily understood to encompass a person whose only travel occurred before the statute took effect.  Indeed, neither the Government nor the dissent identifies any instance in which this Court has construed a present-tense verb in a criminal law to reach preenactment conduct.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this instance, the statutory context strongly supports a forward-looking construction of \xe2\x80\x9ctravels.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d is followed in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) by a series of other present tense verbs\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c<em>enters</em> or <em>leaves</em>, or <em>resides</em> in, Indian country.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  This Court has previously described a statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundeviating use of the present tense\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cstriking indic[ator]\xe2\x80\x9d of its \xe2\x80\x9cprospective orientation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gwaltney</em>, 484 U. S., at 59.  The Seventh Circuit thought otherwise, reasoning that it would \xe2\x80\x9cmak[e] no sense\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9ca sex offender who has resided in Indian country since long before the Act was passed [to be] subject to the Act but not someone who crossed state lines before the Act was passed.\xe2\x80\x9d  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583.  As a textual matter, however, it is the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach that makes little sense: If \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9ctraveled\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, a person \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d if he crossed state lines <em>before </em>SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment), then the only way to avoid an incongruity among neighboring verbs would be to construe the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cresides i[n] Indian country\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass persons who once resided in Indian country but who left before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and have not since returned\xe2\x80\x94an implausible reading that neither the Seventh Circuit, nor the Government, nor the dissent endorses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the other elements of a \xc2\xa72250 violation are similarly set forth in the present tense.  Sections 2250(a)(1) and (a)(3) refer, respectively, to any person who \xe2\x80\x9c<em>is</em> required to register under [SORNA]\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly <em>fails</em> to register or update a registration as required by [SORNA].\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The Government accepts that this last element\xe2\x80\x94a knowing failure to register or update a registration\xe2\x80\x94must postdate SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  Had Congress intended preenactment conduct to satisfy the first two requirements of \xc2\xa72250 but not the third, it presumably would have varied the verb tenses to convey this meaning.  Indeed, numerous federal statutes use the past-perfect tense to describe one or more elements of a criminal offense when coverage of preenactment events is intended.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7249(a)(2)(B)(iii) (Supp. 2010) (proscribing hate crimes in which \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant employs a firearm, dangerous weapon, explosive or incendiary device, or other weapon that <em>has traveled</em> in interstate or foreign commerce\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 18 U.

The absence of similar phrasing here provides powerful evidence that \xc2\xa72250 targets only postenactment travel.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Echoing the Seventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s assessment that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of present-tense verbs in \xc2\xa72250 is \xe2\x80\x9cnot very revealing,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 17, the Government offers two principal arguments for construing the statute to cover pre-SORNA travel: First, such a reading avoids an \xe2\x80\x9canomaly\xe2\x80\x9d in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage of federal versus state sex offenders; and second, it \xe2\x80\x9cbetter effectuates the statutory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 22 (capitalization omitted).  Neither argument persuades us to adopt the Government\xe2\x80\x99s strained reading of the statutory text.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2250 imposes criminal liability on two categories of persons who fail to adhere to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements: any person who is a sex offender \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of a conviction under Federal law \xe2\x80\xa6 , the law of the\nDistrict of Columbia, Indian tribal law, or the law\nof any territory or possession of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(A), and any other person required to register under SORNA who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate or foreign commerce, or enters or leaves, or resides in, Indian country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B).  According to the Government, these categories correspond to \xe2\x80\x9ctwo alternate sources of power to achieve Congress\xe2\x80\x99s aim of broadly registering sex offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 22.  Placing pre-SORNA travelers within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage, the Government maintains, \xe2\x80\x9censures that the jurisdictional reach of Section 2250(a)(2) has a comparable breadth as applied to both federal and state sex offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 21.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s pronouncement that \xc2\xa72250 should have an \xe2\x80\x9cequally broad sweep\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to federal and state offenders, <em>id</em>., at 22, is little more than <em>ipse dixit</em>.  Had Congress intended to subject any unregistered state sex offender who has ever traveled in interstate commerce to federal prosecution under \xc2\xa72250, it easily could have adopted language to that effect.  That it declined to do so indicates that Congress instead chose to handle federal and state sex offenders differently.  There is nothing \xe2\x80\x9canomal[ous]\xe2\x80\x9d about such a choice.  To the contrary, it is entirely reasonable for Congress to have assigned the Federal Government a special role in ensuring compliance with SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements by federal sex offenders\xe2\x80\x94persons who typically would have spent time under federal criminal supervision.  It is similarly reasonable for Congress to have given the States primary responsibility for supervising and ensuring compliance among state sex offenders and to have subjected such offenders to federal criminal liability only when, after SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, they use the channels of interstate commerce in evading a State\xe2\x80\x99s reach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this regard, it is notable that the federal sex-offender registration laws have, from their inception, expressly relied on state-level enforcement.  Indeed, when it initially set national standards for state sex-offender registration programs in 1994, Congress did not include any federal criminal liability.  Congress instead conditioned certain federal funds on States\xe2\x80\x99 adoption of \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal penalties\xe2\x80\x9d on any person \xe2\x80\x9crequired to register under a State program \xe2\x80\xa6 who knowingly fails to so register and keep such registration current.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Pub. L. 103\xe2\x80\x93322, Tit. XVII, \xc2\xa7170101(c), 108 Stat. 2041, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071(d).  Two years later, Congress supplemented state enforcement mechanisms by subjecting to federal prosecution any covered sex offender who \xe2\x80\x9cchanges address to a State other than the State in which the person resided at the time of the immediately preceding registration\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly fails to\xe2\x80\x9d register as required.  Pam Lychner Sexual Offender Tracking and Identification Act of 1996, Pub. L. 104\xe2\x80\x93236, \xc2\xa72, 110 Stat. 3095, 3096, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714072(g)(3), (i).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The prospective orientation of this provision is apparent.  No statutory gap necessitated coverage of unregistered offenders who \xe2\x80\x9cchange[d] address\xe2\x80\x9d before the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment; the prosecution of such persons remained the province of the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In enacting SORNA, Congress preserved this basic allocation of enforcement responsibilities.  To strengthen state enforcement of registration requirements, Congress established, as a funding condition, that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach jurisdiction, other than a Federally recognized Indian tribe, shall provide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716913(e).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Meanwhile, Congress in \xc2\xa72250 exposed to federal criminal liability, with penalties of up to 10 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, persons required to register under SORNA over whom the Federal Government has a direct supervisory interest or who threaten the efficacy of the statutory scheme by traveling in interstate commerce.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Understanding the act of travel as an aspect of the harm Congress sought to punish serves to distinguish \xc2\xa72250 from the felon-in-possession statute to which the Seventh Circuit analogized.  See 551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582\xe2\x80\x93583.  In <em>Scarborough</em>, this Court held that a prior version of the statute, which imposed criminal liability on any convicted felon who \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98possesses \xe2\x80\xa6 in commerce or affecting commerce \xe2\x80\xa6 any firearm,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 431 U. S., at 564 (quoting 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa71202(a) (1970 ed.)), did not require the Government to prove postenactment movement of the firearm across state lines.  According to the Court, Congress had given \xe2\x80\x9cno indication of any concern with either the movement of the gun or the possessor or with the time of acquisition.\xe2\x80\x9d  431 U. S., at 572.  Its aim was simply \xe2\x80\x9cto keep guns out of the hands of\xe2\x80\x9d convicted felons, <em>ibid</em>., and, by using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cin commerce or affecting commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d it invoked the full breadth of its Commerce Clause authority to achieve that end.  No one in <em>Scarborough </em>disputed, however, that the act of possession had to occur post-\nenactment; a felon who \xe2\x80\x9cpossess[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d a firearm only preenactment was plainly outside the statute\xe2\x80\x99s sweep.  In this case, the proper analogy is not, as the Seventh Circuit suggested, between the travel of a sex offender and the movement of a firearm; it is between the sex offender who \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d and the convicted felon who \xe2\x80\x9cpossesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  The act of travel by a convicted sex offender may serve as a jurisdictional predicate for \xc2\xa72250, but it is also, like the act of possession, the very conduct at which Congress took aim.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a final effort to justify its position, the Government invokes one of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s underlying purposes: to locate sex offenders who had failed to abide by their registration obligations.  SORNA, the Government observes, was motivated at least in part by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern about these \xe2\x80\x9cmissing\xe2\x80\x9d sex offenders\xe2\x80\x94a problem the House Committee on the Judiciary expressly linked to interstate travel: \xe2\x80\x9cThe most significant enforcement issue in the sex offender program is that over 100,000 sex offenders, or nearly one-fifth in the Nation[,] are \xe2\x80\x98missing,\xe2\x80\x99 meaning they have not complied with sex offender registration requirements.  This typically occurs when the sex offender moves from one State to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93218, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa026 (2005).  The goal of tracking down missing sex offenders, the Government maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cis surely better served by making Section 2250 applicable to them in their new States of residence immediately than by waiting for them to travel in interstate commerce and fail to register yet again.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  The Court of Appeals expressed a similar view.  See 551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument confuses a general goal of SORNA with the specific purpose of \xc2\xa72250.  Section 2250 is not a stand-alone response to the problem of missing sex offenders; it is embedded in a broader statutory scheme enacted to address the deficiencies in prior law that had enabled sex offenders to slip through the cracks.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716901 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress in this chapter establishes a comprehensive national system for the registration of [sex] offenders\xe2\x80\x9d).  Among its many provisions, SORNA instructs States to maintain sex-offender registries that compile an array of information about sex offenders, \xc2\xa716914; to make this information publicly available online, \xc2\xa716918; to share the information with other jurisdictions and with the Attorney General for inclusion in a comprehensive national sex-offender registry, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716919\xe2\x80\x9316921; and to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide a criminal penalty that includes a maximum term of imprisonment that is greater than 1 year for the failure of a sex offender to comply with the requirements of this subchapter,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa716913(e).  Sex offenders, in turn, are required to \xe2\x80\x9cregister, and keep the registration current, in each jurisdiction where the offender resides, where the offender is an employee, and where the offender is a student,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa716913(a), and to appear in person periodically to \xe2\x80\x9callow the jurisdiction to take a current photograph, and verify the information in each registry in which that offender is required to be registered,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa716916.  By facilitating the collection of sex-offender information and its dissemination among jurisdictions, these provisions, not \xc2\xa72250, stand at the center of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to account for missing sex offenders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Knowing that Congress aimed to reduce the number of noncompliant sex offenders thus tells us little about the specific policy choice Congress made in enacting \xc2\xa72250.  While subjecting pre-SORNA travelers to punishment under \xc2\xa72250 may well be consistent with the aim of finding missing sex offenders, a contrary construction in no way frustrates that broad goal.  Taking account of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s overall structure, we have little reason to doubt that Congress intended \xc2\xa72250 to do exactly what it says: to subject to federal prosecution sex offenders who elude SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements by traveling in interstate commerce.  Cf. <em>Mertens</em> v. <em>Hewitt Associates</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/248/index.html">508 U. S. 248</a>, 261 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9c[V]ague notions of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98basic purpose\xe2\x80\x99 are \xe2\x80\xa6 inadequate to overcome the words of its text regarding the <em>specific </em>issue under consideration\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the legislative materials the Government cites as evidence of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose calls this reading into question.

Yet this did not stop the Committee from describing its legislation as a solution to the problem of missing sex offenders.  See <em>id</em>., at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 26, 45\xe2\x80\x9346.

Several Circuits, including the Seventh, have taken the position that the Act did not apply to such sex offenders until the Attorney General provided for their inclusion by issuing an interim regulation, 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897, on February 28, 2007.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hatcher</em>, 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 222, 226\xe2\x80\x93229 (CA4 2009);<em> United States</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, 583 F.\xc2\xa03d 408, 414\xe2\x80\x93419 (CA6 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>,<em> </em>551 F.\xc2\xa03d 578, 582 (CA7 2008) (case below); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Madera</em>, 528 F.\xc2\xa03d 852, 857\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA11 2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Other Circuits have held that persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions became subject to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements upon the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in July 2006.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>May</em>, 535 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 915\xe2\x80\x93919; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hinckley</em>, 550 F.\xc2\xa03d 926, 929\xe2\x80\x93935 (CA10 2008).  Because Carr traveled from Alabama to Indiana before both the enactment of SORNA and the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, we have no occasion to consider whether a pre-SORNA sex offender whose travel and failure to register occurred between July 2006 and February 2007 is subject to liability under \xc2\xa72250, and we express no view on that question.  We similarly express no view as to whether \xc2\xa772.3 was properly promulgated\xe2\x80\x94a question that has also divided the Circuits.  Compare <em>Cain</em>, 583 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 419\xe2\x80\x93424 (holding that the Attorney General lacked good cause for issuing the interim regulation without adhering to the notice-and-comment and publication requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA)), with<em> United States</em> v. <em>Dean</em>, No. 09\xe2\x80\x9313115, 2010 WL 1687618, *3\xe2\x80\x93*8 (CA11, Apr. 28, 2010) (finding no APA violation); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gould</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa03d 459, 469\xe2\x80\x93470 (CA4 2009) (same).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For persons convicted of sex offenses under federal or Indian tribal law, interstate travel is not a prerequisite to \xc2\xa72250 liability.

This occurs, the dissent maintains, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s account cannot be squared with the statutory text.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he first act necessary for conviction\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72250(a) is not a predicate sex-offense conviction.

Thus, even if the dissent is correct that legislative drafters do not invariably use the moment of enactment to mark the dividing line between covered and uncovered acts, they have clearly done so here.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals quoted a Ninth Circuit decision for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the present tense is commonly used to refer to past, present, and future all at the same time.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583 (quoting <em>Coalition for Clean Air</em> v. <em>Southern\xc2\xa0Cal. Edison Co.</em>, 971 F.\xc2\xa02d 219, 225 (CA9 1992)).  Neither court offered examples of such usage.  Perhaps, as the Dictionary Act itself recognizes, there may be instances in which \xe2\x80\x9ccontext\xe2\x80\x9d supports this sort of omnitemporality, but it is not the typical understanding of the present tense in either normal discourse or statutory construction.  Taken in context, the word \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in \xc2\xa72250 is indistinguishable from the present-tense verbs that appear in myriad other criminal statutes to proscribe conduct on a prospective basis.  Examining a criminal law with a travel element similar to the one at issue here, the Ninth Circuit itself recently agreed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe present tense verb \xe2\x80\x98travels,\xe2\x80\x99 most sensibly read, does not refer to travel that occurred in the past\xe2\x80\x94that is, before the enactment of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, 480 F.\xc2\xa03d 1014, 1019 (CA9 2007) (interpreting 18 U.

All of these examples appear in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716911, a definitional section that merely elucidates the meaning of certain statutory terms and proscribes no conduct.  All but two of the provisions, moreover, rely on the term \xe2\x80\x9csex offender,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xc2\xa716911(1) defines to mean \xe2\x80\x9can individual who <em>was convicted</em> of a sex offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The remaining provisions are \xc2\xa716911(7), which simply uses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d to define whether a prior conviction qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cspecified offense against a minor,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xc2\xa716911(8), which makes plain that its present-tense reference to an offender\xe2\x80\x99s age refers to age \xe2\x80\x9cat the time of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  These examples thus provide scant support for the proposition that \xc2\xa72250 uses \xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to pre-SORNA travel.  Given the well-established presumption against retroactivity and, in the criminal context, the constitutional bar on <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto </em>laws, it cannot be the case that a statutory prohibition set forth in the present tense applies by default to acts completed before the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.

See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa714072(c), (g)(2), (i).

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a), a provision of the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA or Act) that is designed to prevent dangerous sex offenders from evading registration requirements.  SORNA requires convicted sex offenders to register, and to keep their registrations current, in each jurisdiction where they live, work, and go to school, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913, and the provision at issue here, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a), makes it a crime for a convicted sex offender who moves in interstate commerce[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] to fail to abide by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  The question that we must decide is whether \xc2\xa72250(a) applies only to those sex offenders who travel in interstate commerce after SORNA became law or whether the statute also reaches sex offenders, like petitioner, who were convicted[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and traveled before SORNA took effect but violated the registration requirement after that date.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer is that \xc2\xa72250(a) applies only to sex offenders who moved from State to State after SORNA became law.  The Court reaches this conclusion for two reasons: (1) the verb tense used in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B); and (2) the sequence in which the elements of the offense are listed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As I will attempt to show, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual arguments are thoroughly unsound.  And the conclusion that the Court reaches makes no sense.  To appreciate the folly of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, consider the following two cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first involves a situation in which, for present purposes, I assume that \xc2\xa72250(a) applies.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  A man convicted in State A for sexual abuse is released from custody in that State and then, after the enactment of SORNA, moves to State B and fails to register as required by State B law.  Section 2250(a) makes this offender\xe2\x80\x99s failure to register in State B a federal crime because his interstate movement frustrates SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  Because this offender is convicted and then released from custody in State A, the State A authorities know of his presence in their State and are thus in a position to try to ensure that he remains registered.  At the time of his release, they can ascertain where he intends to live, and they can make sure that he registers as required by state law.  Thereafter, they can periodically check the address at which he is registered to confirm that he still resides there.  And even if he moves without warning to some other address in the State, they can try to track him down.  Once this offender leaves State A, however, the authorities in that State are severely limited in their ability to monitor his movements.  And because the State B authorities have no notice of his entry into their State, they are at a great disadvantage in trying to enforce State B\xe2\x80\x99s registration law.  Congress enacted \xc2\xa72250(a) in order to punish and deter interstate movement that seriously undermines the enforcement of sex-offender-registration laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second case is the same as the first in all respects except that the sex offender travels from State A to State B before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  In other words, the sex offender is convicted and later released in State A; prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, he moves to State B; and then, after SORNA takes effects, he fails to register in State B, as SORNA requires.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to treat the second case any differently from the first?  In both cases, a sex offender\xe2\x80\x99s interstate movement frustrates enforcement of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements.  In both cases, as a result of that interstate travel, the sex offender\xe2\x80\x99s new neighbors in State B are unaware of the presence of a potentially dangerous person in their community, and the State B law enforcement authorities are hampered in their ability to protect the public.  The second case is the case now before the Court, and the Court offers no plausible explanation why Congress might have wanted to treat this case any differently from the first.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the text of \xc2\xa72250(a) commanded this result, we would, of course, be obligated to heed that command.  But the text of \xc2\xa72250(a) dictates no such thing.  On the contrary, when properly read, it reaches both cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 2250(a) provides in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(1) is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act \xe2\x80\xa6</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(2) .<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">.<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">.<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook"> (B) <em>travels in interstate or foreign commerce</em> .<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">.<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">.<f f="Times New Roman">\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">; and</f></f></f></f></f></f></f></f></f></f></f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(3) knowingly fails to register or update a registration as required by the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p align="left">\nAs I read this language, neither the use of the present tense in paragraph (2)(B) nor the sequence in which the elements are listed provides any basis for limiting the provision to those sex offenders who move from one State to another after SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dominant theme of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that the use of the present tense in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate \xe2\x80\xa6 commerce\xe2\x80\x9d) indisputably means that an offender\xe2\x80\x99s interstate travel must occur after SORNA took effect.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no mystery about the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x98travels,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d petitioner tells us.

And petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument fails because it begs the relevant question.  Petitioner belabors the obvious\xe2\x80\x94that the present tense is not used to refer to events that occurred in the past\xe2\x80\x94but studiously avoids the critical question: At what point in time does \xc2\xa72250(a) speak?  Does it speak as of the time when SORNA took effect?  Or does it speak as of the time when the proscribed conduct occurs?  Without knowing the point in time at which the law speaks, it is impossible to tell what is past and what is present or future.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unspoken premise of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that \xc2\xa72250(a) speaks as of the time when it became law.  And if that premise is accepted, it follows that the use of the present tense in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) means that the requisite interstate travel must occur after, not before, SORNA took effect.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s premise, however, flies in the face of the widely accepted modern legislative drafting convention that a law should <em>not</em> be read to speak as of the date of enactment.  The United States Senate Legislative Drafting Manual directly addresses this point: \xe2\x80\x9cA legislative provision speaks as of any date on which it is read (<em>rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  Senate Office of the Legislative Counsel, Legislative Drafting Manual \xc2\xa7103(a), p.\xc2\xa04 (1997) (emphasis added).  The House Manual makes the same point:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cYour draft should be a movable feast\xe2\x80\x94that is, it speaks as of whatever time it is being read (<em>rather than as of when drafted, enacted, or put into effect</em>).\xe2\x80\x9d  House Legislative Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s Manual on Drafting Style, HLC No. 104\xe2\x80\x931, \xc2\xa7102(c), p.\xc2\xa02 (1995).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In accordance with this convention, modern legislative drafting manuals teach that, except in unusual circumstances, all laws, including penal statutes, should be written in the present tense.  The Senate Manual, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7103(a), at 4, states: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]lways use the present tense unless the provision addresses only the past, the future, or a sequence of events that requires use of a different tense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Similarly, the House Manual, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa7102(c), at 2, advises: \xe2\x80\x9cStay in the Present.\xe2\x80\x93\xe2\x80\x93 Whenever possible, use the present tense (rather than the past or future).\xe2\x80\x9d  Numerous state legislative drafting manuals and other similar handbooks hammer home this same point.

In accordance with current drafting conventions, \xc2\xa72250(a) speaks, not as of the time when the law went into effect, but as of the time when the first act necessary for conviction is committed.  In the case of \xc2\xa72250(a), that occurs when an individual is convicted of a qualifying sex offense, for it is that act that triggers the requirement to register under SORNA.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  For present purposes, we must proceed on the assumption that this event may have occurred before SORNA was enacted.  Viewed as of the time when such a pre-SORNA conviction takes place, every subsequent act, including movement from State to State, occurs in the future and is thus properly described using the present tense.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the present tense (\xe2\x80\x9ctravels\xe2\x80\x9d) supports the application of the statute to a sex offender, like petitioner, who moved from State to State after conviction but before SORNA went into effect.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s present-tense argument is particularly perverse in light of the context in which \xc2\xa72250(a) was adopted.  When SORNA was enacted, Congress elected not to decide for itself whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements\xe2\x80\x94and thus \xc2\xa72250(a)\xe2\x80\x99s criminal penalties\xe2\x80\x94would apply to persons who had been convicted of qualifying sex offenses before SORNA took effect.  Instead, Congress delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide that question.  See \xc2\xa7113(d), 120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(d) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Attorney General shall have the authority to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of this Act\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Pursuant to this delegation, the Attorney General in 2007 issued an interim rule providing that SORNA applies to pre-enactment convictions.  72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (codified at 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends that, if Congress had wanted to make \xc2\xa72250(a) applicable to sex offenders who traveled in interstate commerce before SORNA took effect, Congress could have referred in \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) to a person who \xe2\x80\x9ctraveled,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chas traveled,\xe2\x80\x9d or, at the time of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, \xe2\x80\x9chad traveled\xe2\x80\x9d in interstate commerce.  Brief for Petitioner 19 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Any such phrasing, however, would have strongly suggested that \xc2\xa72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions\xe2\x80\x94the very question that Congress chose not to decide but instead to leave for the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A brief explanation is needed to make clear why wording \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) in the past tense (or the present perfect or past perfect tense) would have had such an effect.  The Court and I agree that \xc2\xa72250(a) applies only to persons who travel in interstate commerce after they are convicted of a qualifying sex offense.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6; <em>infra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Therefore, if \xc2\xa72250(a) had been phrased in the past tense (or the present perfect or past perfect tense), it would seem necessarily to follow that the provision reaches pre-SORNA convictions.  By using the present tense, Congress remained neutral on the question whether the Act reaches those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions and left that question open for the Attorney General.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) embraces pre-SORNA travel is reinforced by the presence of quite a few other SORNA provisions that plainly use the present tense to refer to events that, as a result of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s regulation, may have occurred before SORNA took effect.  For example, an individual may qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ctier II sex offender\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act if, among other things, his sex offense \xe2\x80\x9c<em>involves </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 (i) use of a minor in sexual performance; (ii) solicitation of a minor to practice prostitution; or (iii) production or distribution of child pornography.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716911(3)(B) (emphasis added); see also \xc2\xa716911(4)(B) (offense \xe2\x80\x9c<em>involves</em> kidnapping a minor\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa716911(7) (offense \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves\xe2\x80\x9d certain specified conduct).  Similarly, a sex offender can qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9ctier II sex offender\xe2\x80\x9d if his sex offense \xe2\x80\x9c<em>occurs</em> after the offender <em>becomes</em> a tier I sex offender.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716911(3)(C) (emphasis added); see also \xc2\xa716911(4)(C) (offense \xe2\x80\x9c<em>occurs</em> after the offender <em>becomes</em> a tier II sex offender\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  A juvenile adjudication, moreover, may qualify as a conviction for purposes of the Act only if, among other things, the \xe2\x80\x9coffender <em>is</em> 14 years of age or older at the time of the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716911(8) (emphasis added).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress cast all of these provisions in the present tense, but now that the Attorney General has made SORNA applicable to individuals with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions, all of these provisions must necessarily be interpreted as embracing pre-enactment conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s second reason for holding that 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a) reaches only post-SORNA travel is based on the sequence in which the elements of \xc2\xa72250(a) are listed.  The Court concludes (and I agree) that the first listed element (subsection (a)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cis required to register under the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act\xe2\x80\x9d)) cannot have been violated until the Act took effect.  The Court then reasons that the third listed element (subsection (a)(2)(B) (\xe2\x80\x9ctravels in interstate \xe2\x80\xa6 commerce\xe2\x80\x9d)) must be violated after the first.  See <em>ante</em>, at 6.  The Court explains: \xe2\x80\x9cPersons convicted of sex offenses under state law who fail to register in their State of conviction would otherwise be subject to federal prosecution under \xc2\xa72250 even if they had not left the State after being convicted\xe2\x80\x94an illogical result given the absence of any obvious federal interest in punishing such state offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In other words, the Court reasons that it would be illogical to interpret the statute as reaching a person who first moves from State A to State B, then commits and is convicted of a qualifying sex offense in State B, and subsequently, upon release from custody in State B, fails to register as required under the law of that State.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that there is a good argument that \xc2\xa72250(a) should not be read to apply to such a case, where there is little if any connection between the offender\xe2\x80\x99s prior interstate movement and his subsequent failure to register.  In the two hypothetical cases discussed at the beginning of this opinion, the offender\xe2\x80\x99s interstate movement seriously frustrated the ability of the law enforcement authorities in his new State (State B) to enforce its registration requirements.  By contrast, where an offender\xe2\x80\x99s interstate movement predates his sex offense and conviction, his interstate movement has little if any effect on the ability of the law enforcement authorities in State B to enforce that State\xe2\x80\x99s laws.  When a sex offender is released from custody in State B, the ability of the State B authorities to enforce that State\xe2\x80\x99s registration laws would appear to be the same regardless of whether that offender had lived his entire life in that State or had moved to the State prior to committing the offense for which he was convicted.  Accordingly, it can be argued that Congress cannot have meant to reach this situation.  As the Seventh Circuit put it, \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ince the statutory aim is to prevent a convicted sex offender from circumventing registration by leaving the state in which he is registered, it can be argued that the travel must postdate the conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 578, 582 (2008).  It can also be argued that a broader construction would mean that Congress exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument shows, however, is not that the interstate travel required by \xc2\xa72250(a) must come <em>after SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment</em>.  Rather, what the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument suggests is that the interstate travel must come <em>after the sex-offense conviction</em>.  And because, under the regulation promulgated by the Attorney General, \xc2\xa72250(a) reaches pre-SORNA convictions, this argument does not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the interstate travel needed under \xc2\xa72250(a) must have occurred after SORNA was enacted.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When an interpretation of a statutory text leads to a result that makes no sense, a court should at a minimum go back and verify that the textual analysis is correct.  Here, not only are the Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual arguments unsound for the reasons explained above, but the indefensible results produced by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation should have led the Court to doublecheck its textual analysis.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0SORNA was a response to a dangerous gap in the then-existing sex-offender-registration laws.  In the years prior to SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the Nation had been shocked by cases in which children had been raped and murdered by persons who, unbeknownst to their neighbors or the police, were convicted sex offenders.  In response, Congress and state legislatures passed laws requiring the registration of sex offenders.  See <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/84/index.html">538 U. S. 84</a>, 89\xe2\x80\x9390 (2003); Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Act, Tit. 17, 108 Stat. 2038; Megan\xe2\x80\x99s Law, 110 Stat. 1345.  Despite those efforts, by 2006 an estimated 100,000 convicted sex offenders\xe2\x80\x94nearly one-fifth of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s total sex-offender population\xe2\x80\x94remained unregistered.  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 109\xe2\x80\x93218, pt. 1, p.\xc2\xa026 (2005).  The principal problem, a House Report determined, was that sex offenders commonly moved from one State to another and then failed to register in their new State of residence.  <em>Ibid</em>.  In other words, interstate travel was dangerously undermining the effectiveness of state sex-offender-registration laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreting \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) to reach only postenactment travel severely impairs \xc2\xa72250(a)\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness.  As interpreted by the Court, \xc2\xa72250(a) applies to a pre-SORNA sex offender only if that offender traveled in interstate commerce at some point <em>after</em> SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  As the examples discussed at the beginning of this opinion illustrate, however, there is no apparent reason why Congress would have wanted to impose such a requirement.  To the contrary, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, the many sex offenders who had managed to avoid pre-existing registration regimes, mainly by moving from one State to another before SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, are placed beyond the reach of the federal criminal laws.  It surely better serves the enforcement of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements to apply \xc2\xa72250(a) to all pre-SORNA sex offenders, regardless of whether their interstate travel occurred before or after the statute\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court provides only a weak defense of the result its analysis produces.  The Court suggests that enhanced information collection and sharing and state enforcement of registration laws were the sole weapons that Congress chose to wield in order to deal with those convicted sex offenders whose whereabouts were unknown when SORNA was passed.  See <em>ante, </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9316.  I see no basis for this conclusion.  There can be no dispute that the enactment of \xc2\xa72250(a) shows that Congress did not think these measures were sufficient to deal with persons who have qualifying sex-offense convictions and who move from State to State after SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  And in light of that congressional judgment, is there any plausible reason to think that Congress concluded that these same measures would be adequate for those with qualifying sex offense convictions who had already disappeared at the time of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment?[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The Court has no answer, and I submit that there is none.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Seventh Circuit, and I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Section 2250(a) also applies to persons with federal sex-offense convictions, those who travel in foreign commerce, and those who enter, leave, or reside in Indian country.

The Court does not address the separate question whether \xc2\xa72250(a) may validly be applied to a person who was convicted of a qualifying offense before SORNA was enacted.  Congress delegated to the Attorney General the authority to decide whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements\xe2\x80\x94and thus \xc2\xa72250(a)\xe2\x80\x99s criminal penalties\xe2\x80\x94should apply to persons in the latter category, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(d), and the Attorney General has promulgated a regulation providing that they do, 72 Fed. Reg. 8897 (2007) (codified at 28 CFR \xc2\xa772.3 (2009)).  Because the Court does not address the validity of this regulation, I proceed on the assumption that 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See n.\xc2\xa02, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Under 42 U.

The Court relies on the artificial argument that the first act necessary for conviction under 18 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365(a), which authorizes suit against any person \xe2\x80\x9calleged to be in violation\xe2\x80\x9d of a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit.  In <em>Gwaltney, </em>the permit holder had violated its permit between 1981 and 1984, but the permit holder claimed that it had ceased all violations by the time the suit was filed.  484 U. S., at 53\xe2\x80\x9355.  This Court held that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9calleged to be in violation\xe2\x80\x9d showed that the provision was meant to apply only where an ongoing violation is alleged.  <em>Id., </em>at 59.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe provision at issue in <em>Gwaltney</em> differs from \xc2\xa72250(a) in that it specifies the relevant temporal point of reference, namely, the point in time when the allegation of an ongoing violation is made.  Section 2250(a) contains no similar specification.  Moreover, the <em>Gwaltney</em> Court did not read the provision at issue there as speaking at the time when the provision was enacted.  As noted above, however, the silent premise of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that \xc2\xa72250(a) must be read as speaking as of the time of SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To be sure, at least two Courts of Appeals have held that SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements apply by the Act\xe2\x80\x99s own terms to those individuals with sex-offense convictions that predate SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hinckley</em>, 550 F.\xc2\xa03d 926, 929\xe2\x80\x93935 (CA10 2008); <em>United States</em> v. <em>May</em>, 535 F.\xc2\xa03d 912, 918\xe2\x80\x93919 (CA8 2008).  Other Courts of Appeals, however, have disagreed, reasoning that SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s explicit grant of authority to the Attorney General to determine the Act\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to offenders with pre-SORNA convictions implies that the Act would not apply to those sex offenders absent the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s regulation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Cain</em>, 583 F.\xc2\xa03d 408, 414\xe2\x80\x93415, 419 (CA6 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hatcher</em>, 560 F.\xc2\xa03d 222, 226\xe2\x80\x93229 (CA4 2009); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d 578, 585 (CA7 2008) (case below); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Madera</em>, 528 F.\xc2\xa03d 852, 856\xe2\x80\x93859 (CA11 2008).  Those Courts of Appeals in the latter group, in my view, have the better of the argument.  Section 113(d) of SORNA delegates to the Attorney General the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to specify the applicability of the requirements of [Title I of SORNA] to sex offenders convicted before the enactment of [the] Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  120 Stat. 594, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716913(d).  The clear negative implication of that delegation is that, without such a determination by the Attorney General, the Act would not apply to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although not controlling, it is worth noting that one of the two examples the Attorney General included in his February 2007 rule contemplated that pre-SORNA travel would be sufficient to satisfy \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s interstate-travel requirement.

Had the Attorney General not exercised his discretion to make SORNA\xe2\x80\x99s registration requirements applicable to those with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions, all of these provisions would have applied to only postenactment conduct\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding \xc2\xa716911(1)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9can individual who <em>was convicted</em> of a sex offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  But now that the Attorney General has so exercised his discretion, all of these present-tense-phrased provisions necessarily must be interpreted as reaching pre-enactment conduct.  The same conclusion should follow with respect to 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Additionally, I do not suggest that the \xe2\x80\x9cdefault\xe2\x80\x9d rule is that provisions written in the present tense apply to past conduct.  To the contrary, I had thought it an uncontroversial proposition of statutory interpretation that statutes must be interpreted in context.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States Nat. Bank of Ore.</em> v. <em>Independent Ins. Agents of America, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/439/index.html">508 U. S. 439</a>, 455 (1993); see also 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7 1.  And when \xc2\xa72250(a) is read with an eye to the context in which SORNA was enacted, it becomes quite clear that \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) should be interpreted as reaching pre-enactment travel.  Giving effect to those contextual indicators, moreover, does not offend the presumption against retroactivity or the <em>Ex Post Facto </em>Clause.  See n.\xc2\xa010, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see <em>ante</em>, at 15, n. 9, it is no answer to point to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to delegate to the Attorney General the responsibility of deciding whether \xc2\xa72250(a) should reach persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.  Of course, that delegation created the possibility that the Attorney General would decide that \xc2\xa72250(a) should not apply to such offenders, and if he had so decided it would likely follow that post-SORNA interstate travel would also be required.  (This is the case because, as previously explained, there is a strong argument that \xc2\xa72250(a) requires interstate travel that comes after a qualifying conviction.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Now that the Attorney General has decided that \xc2\xa72250(a) reaches persons with pre-SORNA sex offense convictions, however, the relevant question is this: Is there any reason why Congress might have wanted to draw a distinction between (1) persons with pre-SORNA convictions and pre-SORNA travel and (2) persons with pre-SORNA convictions and post-SORNA travel?  And to this question, the Court offers no plausible answer.</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner makes the additional argument that interpreting \xc2\xa72250(a)(2)(B) to reach pre-enactment travel renders the statute an unlawful <em>ex\xc2\xa0post facto</em> law.  See U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa79, cl.\xc2\xa03.  Petitioner remained unregistered in Indiana five months after the promulgation of the regulation making SORNA applicable to persons with pre-SORNA sex-offense convictions.  For essentially the reasons explained by the Court of Appeals, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 551 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 585\xe2\x80\x93587, I would reject petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ex post facto</em> argument.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
