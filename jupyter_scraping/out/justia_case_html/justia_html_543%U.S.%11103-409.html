V.

The Court accepts KP\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it has used the single-word version since 1990 or 1991.  In 1992, Lasting registered a trademark that included the words \xe2\x80\x9cMicro Colors\xe2\x80\x9d under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71051,  and, in 1999, the registration became incontestable, \xc2\xa71065.  When Lasting demanded that KP stop using the word \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocolor,\xe2\x80\x9d KP sued for declaratory relief.  Lasting counterclaimed, alleging, <em>inter alia, </em>that KP had infringed Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s trademark.  KP responded by asserting the statutory affirmative defense of fair use, \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).  Finding that Lasting conceded that KP used \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocolor\xe2\x80\x9d only to describe its goods and not as a mark, the District Court held that KP was acting fairly and in good faith because KP undisputedly had employed the term continuously from before Lasting adopted its mark.  Without enquiring whether the practice was likely to cause consumer confusion, the court concluded that KP had made out its affirmative defense under \xc2\xa71115(b)(4) and entered summary judgment for KP on Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim.  Reversing, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court erred in addressing the fair use defense without delving into the matter of possible consumer confusion about the origin of KP\xe2\x80\x99s goods.  The court did not pointedly address the burden of proof, but appears to have placed it on KP to show the absence of such confusion.<em> </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A party raising the statutory affirmative defense of fair use to a claim of trademark infringement does not have a burden to negate any likelihood that the practice complained of will confuse consumers about the origin of the goods or services affected.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Although \xc2\xa71115(b) makes an incontestable registration \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 of the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right to use the \xe2\x80\xa6 mark,\xe2\x80\x9d it also subjects a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s success to \xe2\x80\x9cproof of infringement as defined in section 1114.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section \xc2\xa71114(1) in turn requires a showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual practice is \xe2\x80\x9clikely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\xe2\x80\x9d consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Two Pesos, Inc.</em> v. <em>Taco Cabana, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/763/index.html">505 U. S. 763</a>, 780.  Thus, a plaintiff claiming infringement of an incontestable mark must show likelihood of consumer confusion as part of the prima facie case.  This plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden must be kept in mind when reading \xc2\xa71115(b)(4), which provides the fair use defense to a party whose \xe2\x80\x9cuse of the \xe2\x80\xa6 term \xe2\x80\xa6 charged to be an infringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark, \xe2\x80\xa6 of a term \xe2\x80\xa6 which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is evident (1) that \xc2\xa71115(b) places a burden of proving likelihood of confusion (that is, infringement) on the party charging infringement even when relying on an incontestable registration, and (2) that Congress said nothing about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements of the fair use defense in \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).  It therefore takes a long stretch to claim that a fair use defense entails any burden to negate confusion.  It is not plausible that Congress would have used \xc2\xa71114\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9clikely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the requirement that a markholder show likelihood of consumer confusion, but would have relied on \xc2\xa71115(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9cused fairly\xe2\x80\x9d to give a defendant the burden to negate confusion.  See, <em>e.g., Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U. S. 16</a>, 23.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s failure to say anything about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s burden on this point was almost certainly not an oversight, since the House Trademarks Subcommittee refused to forward a proposal expressly providing likelihood to deceive the public as an element of the fair use defense.  Lasting argues unpersuasively that \xe2\x80\x9cused fairly\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71115(b)(4) is an oblique incorporation of a likelihood-of-confusion test developed in the common law of unfair competition.  While cases such as <em>Baglin</em> v. <em>Cusenier Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/221/580/index.html">221 U. S. 580</a>, are consistent with taking account of the likelihood of consumer confusion as one consideration in deciding whether a use is fair, they cannot be read to make an assessment of confusion alone<font b="1"> dispositive or provide that the defense has a burden to negate it entirely.  Finally, a look at the typical course of litigation in an infringement action points up the incoherence of placing a burden to show nonconfusion on a defendant.  If a plaintiff succeeds in making out a prima facie case, including the element of likelihood of confusion, the defendant may offer rebutting evidence to undercut the force of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on this element, or raise an affirmative defense to bar relief even if the prima facie case is sound, or do both.  It would make no sense to give the defendant a defense of showing affirmatively that the plaintiff cannot succeed in proving some element (like confusion); all the defendant needs to do is to leave the factfinder unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point.  Nor would it make sense to provide an affirmative defense of no confusion plus good faith, when merely rebutting the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case on confusion would entitle the defendant to judgment, good faith or not.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Since the burden of proving likelihood of confusion rests with the plaintiff, and the fair use defendant has no free-standing need to show confusion unlikely, the Court recognizes (contrary to the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view) that some possibility of consumer confusion is compatible with fair use.  It would be improvident to go further here, for deciding anything more would take the Court beyond the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of the subject.  Because the Court does not rule out the pertinence of the degree of consumer confusion under the fair use defense, it does not pass upon the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position that \xc2\xa71115(b)(4)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cused fairly\xe2\x80\x9d requirement demands only that the descriptive term describe the goods accurately.  Accuracy has to be a consideration in assessing fair use, but the proceedings below have raised no occasion to evaluate other concerns that courts might pick as relevant\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> commercial justification and the strength of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s mark\xe2\x80\x94as to which the door is not closed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71115(b)(4), has a burden to negate any likelihood that the practice complained of will confuse consumers about the origin of the goods or services affected.  We hold it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each party to this case sells permanent makeup, a mixture of pigment and liquid for injection under the skin to camouflage injuries and modify nature\xe2\x80\x99s dispensations, and each has used some version of the term \xe2\x80\x9cmicro color\xe2\x80\x9d (as one word or two, singular or plural) in marketing and selling its product.  Petitioner KP Permanent Make-Up, Inc., claims to have used the single-word version since 1990 or 1991 on advertising flyers and since 1991 on pigment bottles.  Respondents Lasting Impression I, Inc., and its licensee, MCN International, Inc. (Lasting, for simplicity), deny that KP began using the term that early, but we accept KP\xe2\x80\x99s allegation as true for present purposes; the District and Appeals Courts took it to be so, and the disputed facts do not matter to our resolution of the issue.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1992, Lasting applied to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa01051 for registration of a trademark consisting of the words \xe2\x80\x9cMicro Colors\xe2\x80\x9d in white letters separated by a green bar within a black square.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The PTO registered the mark to Lasting in 1993, and in 1999 the registration became incontestable.  \xc2\xa71065.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was also in 1999 that KP produced a 10-page advertising brochure using \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocolor\xe2\x80\x9d in a large, stylized typeface, provoking Lasting to demand that KP stop using the term.  Instead, KP sued Lasting in the Central District of California, seeking, on more than one ground, a declaratory judgment that its language infringed no such exclusive right as Lasting claimed.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Lasting counterclaimed, alleging, among other things, that KP had infringed Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cMicro Colors\xe2\x80\x9d trademark.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0KP sought summary judgment on the infringement counterclaim, based on the statutory affirmative defense of fair use, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).  After finding that Lasting had conceded that KP used the term only to describe its goods and not as a mark, the District Court held that KP was acting fairly and in good faith because undisputed facts showed that KP had employed the term \xe2\x80\x9cmicrocolor\xe2\x80\x9d continuously from a time before Lasting adopted the two-word, plural variant as a mark.  Without enquiring whether the practice was likely to cause confusion, the court concluded that KP had made out its affirmative defense under \xc2\xa71115(b)(4) and entered summary judgment for KP on Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claim.  See SA CV 00\xe2\x80\x93276\xe2\x80\x93GLT (EEx), (May 16, 2001), pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939, App. to Cert. 29a\xe2\x80\x9330a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, 328 F.\xc2\xa03d 1061 (2003), the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit thought it was error for the District Court to have addressed the fair use defense without delving into the matter of possible confusion on the part of consumers about the origin of KP\xe2\x80\x99s goods.  The reviewing court took the view that no use could be recognized as fair where any consumer confusion was probable, and although the court did not pointedly address the burden of proof, it appears to have placed it on KP to show absence of consumer confusion.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1072 (\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, KP can only benefit from the fair use defense if there is no likelihood of confusion between KP\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x98micro color\xe2\x80\x99 and Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s mark\xe2\x80\x9d).  Since it found there were disputed material facts relevant under the Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s eight-factor test for assessing the likelihood of confusion, it reversed the summary judgment and remanded the case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted KP\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1099/index.html">540 U. S. 1099</a> (2004), to address a disagreement among the Courts of Appeals on the significance of likely confusion for a fair use defense to a trademark infringement claim, and the obligation of a party defending on that ground to show that its use is unlikely to cause consumer confusion.  Compare 328 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1072 (likelihood of confusion bars the fair use defense); <em>PACCAR Inc.</em> v. <em>TeleScan Technologies, L.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0C.</em>, 319 F.\xc2\xa03d 243, 256 (CA6 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] finding of a likelihood of confusion forecloses a fair use defense\xe2\x80\x9d); and <em>Zatarains, Inc.</em> v. <em>Oak Grove Smokehouse</em>, 698 F.\xc2\xa02d 786, 796 (CA5 1983) (alleged infringers were free to use words contained in a trademark \xe2\x80\x9cin their ordinary, descriptive sense, so long as such use [did] not tend to confuse customers as to the source of the goods\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>Cosmetically Sealed Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Chesebrough-Pond\xe2\x80\x99s USA Co.</em>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 28, 30\xe2\x80\x9331 (CA2 1997) (the fair use defense may succeed even if there is likelihood of confusion); <em>Shakespeare Co. </em>v. <em>Silstar Corp. of Am.</em>, 110 F.\xc2\xa03d 234, 243 (CA4 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] determination of likely confusion [does not] preclud[e] considering the fairness of use\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Sunmark, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.</em>, 64 F.\xc2\xa03d 1055, 1059 (CA7 1995) (finding that likelihood of confusion did not preclude the fair use defense).

If the registrant then satisfies further conditions including continuous use for five consecutive years, \xe2\x80\x9cthe right \xe2\x80\xa6 to use such registered mark in commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to designate the origin of the goods specified in the registration \xe2\x80\x9cshall be incontestable\xe2\x80\x9d outside certain listed exceptions.   \xc2\xa71065.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The holder of a registered mark (incontestable or not) has a civil action against anyone employing an imitation of it in commerce when \xe2\x80\x9csuch use is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71114(1).  Although an incontestable registration is \xe2\x80\x9cconclusive evidence \xe2\x80\xa6 of the registrant\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive right to use the \xe2\x80\xa6 mark in commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71115(b), the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s success is still subject to \xe2\x80\x9cproof of infringement as defined in section 1114,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71115(b).  And that, as just noted, requires a showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actual practice is likely to produce confusion in the minds of consumers about the origin of the goods or services in question.  See <em>Two Pesos, Inc.</em> v. <em>Taco Cabana, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/763/index.html">505 U. S. 763</a>, 780 (1992) (Stevens,\xc2\xa0J., concurring); <em>Lone Star Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc.</em> v. <em>Alpha of Virginia, Inc.</em>, 43 F.\xc2\xa03d 922, 935 (CA4 1995); Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition \xc2\xa721, Comment <em>a</em> (1995).  This plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s burden has to be kept in mind when reading the relevant portion of the further provision for an affirmative defense of fair use, available to a party whose</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cuse of the name, term, or device charged to be an\ninfringement is a use, otherwise than as a mark, \xe2\x80\xa6 of a term or device which is descriptive of and used fairly and in good faith only to describe the goods or services of such party, or their geographic origin\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two points are evident.  Section 1115(b) places a burden of proving likelihood of confusion (that is, infringement) on the party charging infringement even when relying on an incontestable registration.  And Congress said nothing about likelihood of confusion in setting out the elements of the fair use defense in \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Starting from these textual fixed points, it takes a long stretch to claim that a defense of fair use entails any burden to negate confusion.  It is just not plausible that Congress would have used the descriptive phrase \xe2\x80\x9clikely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71114 to describe the requirement that a markholder show likelihood of consumer confusion, but would have relied on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cused fairly\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71115(b)(4) in a fit of terse drafting meant to place a defendant under a burden to negate confusion.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Russello</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/16/index.html">464 U.

Lasting is certainly correct that some unfair competition cases would stress that use of a term by another in conducting its trade went too far in sowing confusion, and would either enjoin the use or order the defendant to include a disclaimer.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Baglin</em> v. <em>Cusenier Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/221/580/index.html">221 U. S. 580</a>, 602 (1911) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e are unable to escape the conclusion that such use, in the manner shown, was to serve the purpose of simulation \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Co.</em> v. <em>Hall\xe2\x80\x99s Safe Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/554/index.html">208 U.

But the common law of unfair competition also tolerated some degree of confusion from a descriptive use of words contained in another person\xe2\x80\x99s trademark.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>William R. Warner &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Eli Lilly &amp; Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/265/526/index.html">265 U.

While these cases are consistent with taking account of the likelihood of consumer confusion as one consideration in deciding whether a use is fair, see Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>, they do not stand for the proposition that an assessment of confusion alone<font b="1"> may be dispositive.

If a plaintiff succeeds in making out a prima facie case of trademark infringement, including the element of likelihood of consumer confusion, the defendant may offer rebutting evidence to undercut the force of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s evidence on this (or any) element, or raise an affirmative defense to bar relief even if the prima facie case is sound, or do both.  But it would make no sense to give the defendant a defense of showing affirmatively that the plaintiff cannot succeed in proving some element (like confusion); all the defendant needs to do is to leave the factfinder unpersuaded that the plaintiff has carried its own burden on that point.  A defendant has no need of a court\xe2\x80\x99s true belief when agnosticism will do.  Put another way, it is only when a plaintiff has shown likely confusion by a preponderance of the evidence that a defendant could have any need of an affirmative defense, but under Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s theory the defense would be foreclosed in such a case.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t defies logic to argue that a defense may not be asserted in the only situation where it even becomes relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shakespeare Co.</em> v. <em>Silstar Corp.</em>, 110 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 243.  Nor would it make sense to provide an affirmative defense of no confusion plus good faith, when merely rebutting the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case on confusion would entitle the defendant to judgment, good faith or not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lasting tries to extenuate the anomaly of this conception of the affirmative defense by arguing that the oddity reflects the \xe2\x80\x9cvestigial\xe2\x80\x9d character of the fair use defense as a historical matter.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 39.  Lasting argues that, because it was only in 1988 that Congress added the express provision that an incontestable markholder\xe2\x80\x99s right to exclude is \xe2\x80\x9csubject to proof of infringement,\xe2\x80\x9d Trademark Law Revision Act of 1988, \xc2\xa7128(b)(1), 102 Stat. 3944, there was no requirement prior to 1988 that a markholder prove likelihood of confusion.  Before 1988, the argument goes, it was sensible to get at the issue of likely confusion by requiring a defendant to prove its absence when defending on the ground of fair use.  When the 1988 Act saddled the markholder with the obligation to prove confusion likely, \xc2\xa71115(b), the revision simply failed to relieve the fair use defendant of the suddenly strange burden to prove absence of the very confusion that a plaintiff had a new burden to show in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the explanation does not work.  It is not merely that it would be highly suspect in leaving the claimed element of \xc2\xa71115(b)(4) redundant and pointless.  <em>Hibbs</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, 542 U. S. ___, ___, (2004) (slip op., at 10) (noting \xe2\x80\x9crule against superfluities\xe2\x80\x9d in statutory construction).  The main problem of the argument is its false premise: Lasting\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that holders of incontestable marks had no need to prove likelihood of confusion prior to 1988 is wrong.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Beer Nuts, Inc. </em>v. <em>Clover Club Foods Co.</em>, 805 F.\xc2\xa02d 920, 924\xe2\x80\x93925 (CA10 1986) (requiring proof of likelihood of confusion in action by holder of incontestable mark); <em>United States Jaycees</em> v. <em>Philadelphia Jaycees</em>, 639 F.\xc2\xa02d 134, 137, n.\xc2\xa03 (CA3 1981) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]ncontestability [does not] mak[e] unnecessary a showing of likelihood of confusion \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> </em>5<em> </em>J. McCarthy, Trademarks and Unfair Competition \xc2\xa732:154, p. 32\xe2\x80\x93247 (4th ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cBefore the 1988 Trademark Law Revision Act, the majority of courts held that while incontestability grants a conclusive presumption of the \xe2\x80\x98exclusive right to use\xe2\x80\x99 the registered mark, this did not relieve the registrant of proving likelihood of\nconfusion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the burden of proving likelihood of confusion rests with the plaintiff, and the fair use defendant has no free-standing need to show confusion unlikely, it follows (contrary to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99s view) that some possibility of consumer confusion must be compatible with fair use, and so it is.  The common law\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance of a certain degree of confusion on the part of consumers followed from the very fact that in cases like this one an originally descriptive term was selected to be used as a mark, not to mention the undesirability of allowing anyone to obtain a complete monopoly on use of a descriptive term simply by grabbing it first.  <em>Canal Co. </em>v. <em>Clark</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 323\xe2\x80\x93324, 327.  The Lanham Act adopts a similar leniency, there being no indication that the statute was meant to deprive commercial speakers of the ordinary utility of descriptive words.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf any confusion results, that is a risk the plaintiff accepted when it decided to identify its product with a mark that uses a well known descriptive phrase.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cosmetically Sealed Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Chesebrough-Pond\xe2\x80\x99s USA Co.</em>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 30.

It suffices to realize that our holding that fair use can occur along with some degree of confusion does not foreclose the relevance of the extent of any likely consumer confusion in assessing whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s use is objectively fair.  Two Courts of Appeals have found it relevant to consider such scope, and commentators and <em>amici</em> here have urged us to say that the degree of likely consumer confusion bears not only on the fairness of using a term, but even on the further question whether an originally descriptive term has become so identified as a mark that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s use of it cannot realistically be called descriptive.  See <em>Shakespeare Co.</em> v. <em>Silstar Corp.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 243 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the degree that confusion is likely, a use is less likely to be found fair\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis omitted)); <em>Sunmark, Inc.</em> v. <em>Ocean Spray Cranberries, Inc.</em>, 64 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1059; Restatement (Third) of Unfair Competition, \xc2\xa728; Brief for American Intellectual Property Law Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 13\xe2\x80\x9318; Brief for Private Label Manufacturers Association as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 16\xe2\x80\x9317; Brief for Society of Permanent Cosmetic Professionals et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since we do not rule out the pertinence of the degree of consumer confusion under the fair use defense, we likewise do not pass upon the position of the United States, as <em>amicus</em>, that the \xe2\x80\x9cused fairly\xe2\x80\x9d requirement in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa01115(b)(4) demands only that the descriptive term describe the goods accurately.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.  Accuracy of course has to be a consideration in assessing fair use, but the proceedings in this case so far raise no occasion to evaluate some other concerns that courts might pick as relevant, quite apart from attention to confusion.  The Restatement raises possibilities like commercial justification and the strength of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s mark.  Restatement \xc2\xa728.  As to them, it is enough to say here that the door is not closed.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, a plaintiff claiming infringement of an incontestable mark must show likelihood of consumer confusion as part of the prima facie case, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71115(b), while the defendant has no independent burden to negate the likelihood of any confusion in raising the affirmative defense that a term is used descriptively, not as a mark, fairly, and in good faith, \xc2\xa71115(b)(4).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we read the Court of Appeals as requiring KP to shoulder a burden on the issue of confusion, we vacate the judgment and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia joins all but footnotes 4 and 5 of this opinion.
