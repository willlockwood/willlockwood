The only question, then, is whether this act of the legislature is in conflict with the constitution of the state.  And we perceive no conflict.  The legislature, then, having thought fit to make the judgment of the district court in this case final and without appeal, that court is, for this case, the highest court in which the decision could be made, and the writ of error is therefore warranted by the act of Congress, and regular.
