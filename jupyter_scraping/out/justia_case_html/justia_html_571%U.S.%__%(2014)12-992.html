(Haluch) in Federal District Court to collect benefits contributions required to be paid under federal law.  The Funds also sought attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, which were obligations under both a federal statute and the parties\xe2\x80\x99 collective bargaining agreement (CBA).  The District Court issued an order on June 17, 2011, on the merits of the contribution claim and a separate ruling on July 25 on the Funds\xe2\x80\x99 motion for fees and costs.  The Funds appealed both decisions on August 15.  Haluch argued that the June 17 order was a final decision pursuant to\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71291, and thus, the Funds\xe2\x80\x99 notice of appeal was untimely since it was not filed within the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure\xe2\x80\x99s 30-day deadline.  The Funds disagreed, arguing that there was no final decision until July 25.  The First Circuit acknowledged that an unresolved attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees issue generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final, but held that no final decision was rendered until July 25 since the entitlement to fees and costs provided for in the CBA was an element of damages and thus part of the merits.  Accordingly, the First Circuit addressed the appeal with respect to both the unpaid contributions and the fees and costs.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0The appeal of the June 17 decision was untimely.

Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 196\n.  There, this Court held a district court judgment to be a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa71291 purposes despite an unresolved motion for statutory-based attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, noting that fee awards do not remedy the injury giving rise to the action, are often available to the defending party, and were, at common law, an element of \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d awarded to a prevailing party, not a part of the merits judgment.  Id., at 200.  Even if laws authorizing fees might sometimes treat them as part of the merits, considerations of \xe2\x80\x9coperational consistency and predictability in the overall application of \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x9d favored a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 202.

More basic, Budinich\xe2\x80\x99s uniform rule did not depend on whether the law authorizing a particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits, 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201, and there is no reason to depart from that sound reasoning here.  The operational consistency stressed in Budinich is not promoted by providing for different jurisdictional effect based solely on whether an asserted right to fees is based on contract or statute.  Nor is predictability promoted since it is not always clear whether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory.  The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation, but the Budinich Court was aware of such concerns when it adopted a uniform rule, and it suffices to say that those concerns are counterbalanced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed, especially given the complexity and amount of time it may take to resolve attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees claims.  Furthermore, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in many cases.  See, e.g., Rules 54(d)(2), 58(e).  Complex variations in statutory and contractual fee-shifting provisions also counsel against treating attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees claims authorized by contract and statute differently for finality purposes.  The Budinich rule looks solely to the character of the issue that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits.  The Funds suggest that it is unclear whether Budinich applies where, as here, nonattorney professional fees are included in a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  They are mistaken to the extent that they suggest that such fees will be claimed only where a contractual fee claim is involved.  Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to award related litigation expenses like expert fees, see West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, n.\xc2\xa04, and there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell that Budinich remains applicable where such fees are claimed and awarded incidental to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.

Budinich referred to fees \xe2\x80\x9cfor the litigation in question,\xe2\x80\x9d 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202, or \xe2\x80\x9cattributable to the case,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 203, but this Court has observed that \xe2\x80\x9csome of the services performed before a lawsuit is formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are performed \xe2\x80\x98on the litigation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Webb v.

In Budinich v. Becton Dickinson &amp; Co.,\n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 196 (1988)\n, this Court held that a decision on the merits is a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decision\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa71291 even if the award or amount of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the litigation remains to be determined.  The issue in this case is whether a different result obtains if the unresolved claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is based on a contract rather than, or in addition to, a statute.  The answer here, for purposes of \xc2\xa71291 and the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is that the result is not different.  Whether the claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is based on a statute, a contract, or both, the pendency of a ruling on an award for fees and costs does not prevent, as a general rule, the merits judgment from becoming final for purposes of appeal.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner Ray Haluch Gravel Co. (Haluch) is a landscape supply company.  Under a collective-bargaining agreement (CBA) with the International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 98, Haluch was required to pay contributions to union-affiliated benefit funds.  Various of those funds are respondents here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In 2007, respondents (Funds) commissioned an audit to determine whether Haluch was meeting its obligations under the CBA.  Based on the audit, the Funds demanded additional contributions.  Haluch refused to pay, and the Funds filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds alleged that Haluch\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the required contributions was a violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) and the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947.  The Funds also sought attorney\xe2\x80\x99s and auditor\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, under \xc2\xa7502(g)(2)(D) of ERISA,\n\n94Stat.\n1295,\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71132(g)(2)(D) (providing for \xe2\x80\x9creasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs of the action, to be paid by the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d), and the CBA itself, App. to Pet. for Cert. 52a (providing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny costs, including legal fees, of collecting payments due these Funds shall be borne by the defaulting Employer\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At the conclusion of a bench trial, the District Court asked the parties to submit proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to allow the court \xe2\x80\x9cto consider both the possibility of enforcing [a] settlement and a decision on the merits at the same time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 50 (Feb. 28, 2011).  These submissions were due on March 14, 2011.  The District Court went on to observe that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder our rules .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if there is a judgment for the plaintiffs, typically a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees can be filed\xe2\x80\x9d shortly thereafter.

It gave the plaintiffs the option to offer a submission with regard to fees along with their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, or to \xe2\x80\x9cwait to see if I find in your favor and submit the fee petition later on.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds initially chose to submit their fee petitionat the same time as their proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law, but they later changed course.  They requested an extension of time to file their \xe2\x80\x9crequest for reimbursement of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and costs in the above matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Motion to Extend Time to Submit Request for Attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 Fees in No. 09\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9311607\xe2\x80\x93MAP (D Mass.), p. 1.  The District Court agreed; and on April 4, the Funds moved \xe2\x80\x9cfor an [o]rder awarding the total attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and costs incurred .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in attempting to collect this delinquency, in obtaining the audit, in protecting Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 interests, and in protecting the interests of the participants and beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 72.  The motion alleged that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hose fees and costs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. amount to $143,600.44,\xe2\x80\x9d and stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]efendants are liable for these monies pursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d ERISA, \xe2\x80\x9cand for the reasons detailed in the accompanying\xe2\x80\x9d affidavit.  Ibid.  The accompanying \xe2\x80\x9caffidavit in support of [the] application for attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees and costs,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, cited the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreements (including the CBA, as well as related trust agreements) and \xc2\xa7502(g)(2)(D) of ERISA.  Id., at 74.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As to the merits of the claim that Haluch had underpaid, on June 17, 2011, the District Court issued a memorandum and order ruling that the Funds were entitled to certain unpaid contributions, though less than had been requested.  International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 98 Health and Welfare, Pension and Annuity Funds v. Ray Haluch Gravel Co., 792 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 129 (Mass.).  A judgment in favor of the Funds in the amount of $26,897.41 was issued the same day.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a\xe2\x80\x9340a.  The District Court did not rule on the Funds\xe2\x80\x99 motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs until July 25, 2011.  On that date it awarded $18,000 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, plus costs of $16,688.15, for a total award of $34,688.15.  792 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 139, 143.  On August 15, 2011, the Funds ap-pealed from both decisions.  Haluch filed a cross-appeal a week later.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the Court of Appeals Haluch argued that there had been no timely appeal from the June 17 decision on the merits.  In its view, the June 17 decision was a final decision under \xc2\xa71291, so that notice of appeal had to be filed within 30 days thereafter, see Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(1)(A).  The Funds disagreed.  They argued that there was no final decision until July 25, when the District Court rendered a decision on their request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  In their view the appeal was timely as to all issues in the case.  See Digital Equipment Corp. v. Desktop Direct, Inc.,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 863,\n868 (1994)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court of Appeals agreed with the Funds.  695 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 7 (CA1 2012).  It acknowledged this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that an unresolved issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees generally does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.  But it held that this rule does not \xe2\x80\x9cmechanically .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0apply to all claims for attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees, whatever their genesis,\xe2\x80\x9d and that, instead, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here, as here, an entitlement to attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees derives from a contract .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the critical question is whether the claim for attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees is part of the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 6.  Interpreting the CBA in this case as \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] for the payment of attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 fees as an element of damages in the event of a breach,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals held that the June 17 decision was not final.  Ibid.  Concluding that the appeal was timely as to all issues, the Court of Appeals addressed the merits of the dispute with respect to the amount of unpaid remittances as well as the issue of fees and costs, remanding both aspects of the case to the District Court.  Id., at 11.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Haluch sought review here, and certiorari was granted to resolve a conflict in the Courts of Appeals over whether and when an unresolved issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based on a contract prevents a judgment on the merits from being final.  570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).

Catlin v. United States,\n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 229,\n233 (1945)\n.  In Budinich, this Court addressed the question whether an unresolved issue of at-torney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the litigation prevents a judgment from be-ing final.  486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202.  There, a District Court in a diversity case had entered a judgment that left unresolved a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees based on a Colorado statute providing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to prevailing parties in certain cases.

Though the Court acknowledged that the statutory or decisional law authorizing the fees might sometimes treat the fees as part of the merits, it held that considerations of \xe2\x80\x9coperational consistency and predictability in the overall application of \xc2\xa71291\xe2\x80\x9d favored a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform rule that an unresolved issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the litigation in question does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 202.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The facts of this case have instructive similarities to Budinich.  In both cases, a plaintiff sought to recover employment-related payments.  In both cases, the District Court entered a judgment resolving the claim for unpaid amounts but left outstanding a request for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred in the course of litigating the case.  Despite these similarities, the Funds offer two arguments to distinguish Budinich.  First, they contend that unresolved claims for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees authorized by contract, unlike those authorized by statute, are not collateral for finality purposes.  Second, they argue that the claim left unresolved as of June 17 included fees incurred prior to the commencement of formal litigation and that those fees, at least, fall beyond the scope of the rule announced in Budinich.  For the reasons given below, the Court rejects these arguments.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds\xe2\x80\x99 principal argument for the nonfinality of the June 17 decision is that a district court decision that does not resolve a fee claim authorized by contract is not final for purposes of \xc2\xa71291, because it leaves open a claim for contract damages.  They argue that contractual provi-sions for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees or costs of collection, in contrastto statutory attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees provisions, are liquidated-damages provisions intended to remedy the injury giving rise to the action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The premise that contractual attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees provisions are always a measure of damages is unpersuasive, for contractual fee provisions often provide attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to prevailing defendants.  See 1 R. Rossi, Attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 Fees \xc2\xa79:25, p. 9\xe2\x80\x9364 (3d ed. 2012); cf. Gleason, supra, at 137, n.\xc2\xa03.  The Funds\xe2\x80\x99 argument fails, however, for a more basic reason, which is that the Court in Budinich rejected the very distinction the Funds now attempt to draw.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The decision in Budinich made it clear that the uniform rule there announced did not depend on whether the statutory or decisional law authorizing a particular fee claim treated the fees as part of the merits.  486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201.  The Court acknowledged that not all statutory or decisional law authorizing attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees treats those fees as part of \xe2\x80\x9ccosts\xe2\x80\x9d or otherwise not part of the merits; and the Court even accepted for purposes of argument that the Colorado statute in that case \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] plain\xe2\x80\x9d that the fees it authorized \xe2\x80\x9care to be part of the merits judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But this did not matter.  As the Court explained, the issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees was still collateral for finality purposes under \xc2\xa71291.  The Court was not then, nor is it now,\xe2\x80\x9cinclined to adopt a disposition that requires the meritsor nonmerits status of each attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee provision to be clearly established before the time to appeal can be clearly known.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 202.  There is no reason to depart here from this sound reasoning.  By arguing that a different rule should apply to fee claims authorized by contract because they are more often a matter of damages and thus part of the merits, the Funds seek in substance to relitigate an issue already decided in Budinich.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Were the jurisdictional effect of an unresolved issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to depend on whether the entitlement to fees is asserted under a statute, as distinct from a contract, the operational consistency and predictability stressed in Budinich would be compromised in many instances.  Operational consistency is not promoted by providing for different jurisdictional effect to district court decisions that leave unresolved otherwise identical fee claims based solely on whether the asserted right to fees is based on a contract or a statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds\xe2\x80\x99 proposed distinction also does not promote predictability.  Although sometimes it may be clear whether and to what extent a fee claim is contractual rather than statutory in nature, that is not always so.  This case provides an apt illustration.  The Funds\xe2\x80\x99 notice of motion itself cited just ERISA; only by consulting the accompanying affidavit, which included an oblique reference to the CBA, could it be discerned that a contractual fee claim was being asserted in that filing.  This may explain why the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s July 25 decision citedjust ERISA, without mention or analysis of the CBA provi-sion or any other contractual provision. 792 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d,at 140.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds urge the importance of avoiding piecemeal litigation.  The basic point is well taken, yet, in the context of distinguishing between different sources for awards of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, quite inapplicable.  The Court was aware of piecemeal litigation concerns in Budinich, but it still adopted a uniform rule that an unresolved issue of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for the litigation does not prevent judgment on the merits from being final.  Here it suffices to say that the Funds\xe2\x80\x99 concern over piecemeal litigation, though starting from a legitimate principle, is counterbalanced by the interest in determining with promptness and clarity whether the ruling on the merits will be appealed.  Thisis especially so because claims for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees may be complex and require a considerable amount of time to resolve.  Indeed, in this rather simple case, the fee-related submissions take up well over 100 pages in the joint appendix.  App. 64\xe2\x80\x93198.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, furthermore, provide a means to avoid a piecemeal approach in the ordinary run of cases where circumstances warrant delaying the time to appeal.  Rule 54(d)(2) provides for motions claiming attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and related nontaxable expenses.  Rule 58(e), in turn, provides that the entry of judgment ordinarily may not be delayed, nor may the time for appeal be extended, in order to tax costs or award fees.  This accords with Budinich and confirms the general practice of treating fees and costs as collateral for finality purposes.  Having recognized this premise, Rule 58(e) further provides that if a timely motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is made under Rule 54(d)(2), the court may act before a notice of appeal has been filed and become effective to order that the motion have the same effect as a timely motion under Rule 59 for purposes of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(4).  This delays the running of the time to file an appeal until the entry of the order disposing of the fee motion.  Rule 4(a)(4)(A)(iii).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In their brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari, the Funds argued that in their case this procedure would not have been applicable.  Brief in Opposition 34.  Rule 54(d)(2) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and related nontaxable expenses must be made by motion unless the substantive law requires those fees to be proved at trial as an element of damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Advisory Committee Notes to Rule 54(d)(2) state that the procedure outlined in that Rule \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. apply to fees recoverable as an element of damages, as when sought under the terms of a contract; such damages typically are to be claimed in a pleading and may involve issues to be resolved by a jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 1993 Note on subd. (d), par. (2) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54, 28 U. S. C. App., pp. 240\xe2\x80\x93241.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds no longer rely on their reading of Rule 54 and the Advisory Committee Notes as a basis for their argument that the June 17 decision was not final under \xc2\xa71291.  And this is not a case in which the parties attempted to invoke Rule 58(e) to delay the time to appeal.  Regardless of how the Funds\xe2\x80\x99 fee claims could or should have been litigated, however, the Rules eliminate concerns over undue piecemeal appeals in the vast range of cases where a claim for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees is made by motion under Rule 54(d)(2).  That includes some cases in which the fees are authorized by contract.  See 2 M. Derfner &amp; A. Wolf, Court Awarded Attorney Fees \xc2\xb618.01[1][c], pp. 18\xe2\x80\x937 to 18\xe2\x80\x938 (2013) (remarking that Rule 54(d)(2) applies \xe2\x80\x9cregardlessof the statutory, contractual, or equitable basis of the request for fees,\xe2\x80\x9d though noting inapplicability where attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees are an element of damages under the substantive law governing the action).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The complex variations in statutory and contractual fee-shifting provisions also counsel against making the distinction the Funds suggest for purposes of finality.  Some fee-shifting provisions treat the fees as part of the merits; some do not.  Some are bilateral, authorizing fees eitherto plaintiffs or defendants; some are unilateral.  Some de-pend on prevailing party status; some do not.  Some may be unclear on these points.  The rule adopted in Budinich ignores these distinctions in favor of an approach that looks solely to the character of the issue that remains open after the court has otherwise ruled on the merits of the case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In support of their argument against treating contractual and statutory fee claims alike the Funds suggest, nevertheless, that it is unclear whether Budinich still applies where, as here, auditor\xe2\x80\x99s fees (or other nonattorney professional fees) are included as an incidental part of a motion for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  (In this case, auditor\xe2\x80\x99s fees accounted for $6,537 of the $143,600.44 requestedin total.)  To the extent the Funds suggest that similar fees will be claimed alongside attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees only where a contractual fee claim is involved, they are incorrect.  Statutory fee claims are not always limited to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees per\xc2\xa0se.  Many fee-shifting statutes authorize courts to award additional litigation expenses, such as expert fees.  See West Virginia Univ. Hospitals, Inc. v. Casey,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83\n, n.\xc2\xa04 (1991) (listing statutes); cf. Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 54(d)(2)(A) (providing mechanism for claims by motion for \xe2\x80\x9cattorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and related nontaxable expenses\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where, as here, those types of fees are claimed and awarded incidental to attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, there is no apparent reason why parties or courts would find it difficult to tell that Budinich remains applicable.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Funds separately contend that the June 17 decision was not final because their motion claimed some $8,561.75 in auditor\xe2\x80\x99s and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees (plus some modest additional expenses) incurred prior to the commencement of litigation.  These included fees for the initial audit to determine whether Haluch was complying with the CBA, as well as attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees incurred in attempting to obtain records from Haluch, researching fund auditing rights, drafting a letter demanding payment, and working on the initial complaint.  Brief for Respondents 4\xe2\x80\x935; App. 64\xe2\x80\x9367, 81\xe2\x80\x9388.  The Funds argue that these fees do not fall within the scope of Budinich, because the Court in Budinich referred only to fees \xe2\x80\x9cfor the litigation in question,\xe2\x80\x9d 486 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202, or, equivalently, \xe2\x80\x9cattributable to the case,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 203.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The fact that some of the claimed fees accrued before the complaint was filed is inconsequential.  As this Court has observed, \xe2\x80\x9csome of the services performed before a lawsuit is formally commenced by the filing of a complaint are performed \xe2\x80\x98on the litigation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Webb v. Dyer County Bd. of Ed.,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 234,\n243 (1985)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cMost obvious examples\xe2\x80\x9d include \xe2\x80\x9cthe drafting of the initial pleadings and the work associated with the development of the theory of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  More generally, pre-filing tasks may be for the litigation if they are \xe2\x80\x9cboth useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in question.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The fees in this case fit that description.  Investigation, preliminary legal research, drafting of demand letters, and working on the initial complaint are standard preliminary steps toward litigation.  See id., at 250 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is settled that a prevailing party may recover fees for the time spent before the formal commencement of the litigation on such matters as .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. investigation of the facts of the case, research on the viability of potential legal claims, [and] drafting of the complaint and accompanying documents .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 Derfner, supra, \xc2\xb616.02[2][b], at 16\xe2\x80\x9315 (\xe2\x80\x9c[H]ours .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. spent investigating facts specific to the client\xe2\x80\x99s case should be included in the lodestar, whether [or not] that time is spent prior to the filing of a complaint\xe2\x80\x9d).  To be sure, the situation would differ if a party brought a freestanding contract action asserting an entitlement to fees incurred in an effort to collect payments that were not themselves the subject of the litigation.  But that is not this case.  Here the unresolved issue left open by the June 17 order was a claim for fees for the case being resolved on the merits. </p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There was no timely appeal of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s June 17 order.
