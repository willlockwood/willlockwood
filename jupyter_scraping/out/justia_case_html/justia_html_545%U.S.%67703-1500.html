The legislative record illustrates that, after accepting the monument from the Fraternal Order of Eagles\xe2\x80\x94a national social, civic, and patriotic organization\xe2\x80\x94the State selected a site for it based on the recommendation of the state organization that maintains the capitol grounds.  Petitioner, an Austin resident who encounters the monument during his frequent visits to those grounds, brought this 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 suit seeking a declaration that the monument\xe2\x80\x99s placement violates the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal.  Holding that the monument did not contravene the Clause, the District Court found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency, and that a reasonable observer, mindful of history, purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State endorsed religion.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The judgment is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">351 F.\xc2\xa03d 173, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice, joined by Justice Scalia, Justice Kennedy, and Justice Thomas, concluded that the Establishment Clause allows the display of a monument inscribed with the Ten Commandments on the Texas State Capitol grounds.  Reconciling the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, see <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html"></a><a href="/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213, with the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom requires that the Court neither abdicate its responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion, <em>e.g., Zorach</em> v. <em>Clauson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/index.html">343 U. S. 306</a>, 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  While the Court has sometimes pointed to <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/index.html">403 U. S. 602</a>, for the governing test, <em>Lemon</em> is not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its capitol grounds.  Instead, the analysis should be driven by both the monument\xe2\x80\x99s nature and the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  From at least 1789, there has been an unbroken history of official acknowledgment by all three branches of government of religion\xe2\x80\x99s role in American life.  <em>Lynch </em>v.<em> Donnelly, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 674.  Texas\xe2\x80\x99 display of the Commandments on government property is typical of such acknowledgments.  Representations of the Commandments appear throughout this Court and its grounds, as well as the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.  Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinions, like its building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in America\xe2\x80\x99s heritage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/index.html">366 U. S. 420</a>, 442, 462.  While the Commandments are religious, they have an undeniable historical meaning.  Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.  See, <em>e.g., Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly, supra</em>, at 680, 687.  There are, of course, limits to the government\xe2\x80\x99s display of religious messages or symbols.  For example, this Court held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom.  <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a>, 41\xe2\x80\x9342.  However, neither <em>Stone</em> itself nor subsequent opinions have indicated that <em>Stone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding would extend beyond the context of public schools to a legislative chamber, see <em>Marsh</em> v.<em> Chambers, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a>, or to capitol grounds.  Texas\xe2\x80\x99 placement of the Commandments monument on its capitol grounds is a far more passive use of those texts than was the case in <em>Stone,</em> where the text confronted elementary school students every day.  Indeed, petitioner here apparently walked by the monument for years before bringing this suit.  <em>Schempp, supra,</em> and <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a>, distinguished.  Texas has treated her capitol grounds monuments as representing several strands in the State\xe2\x80\x99s political and legal history.  The inclusion of the Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government, that cannot be said to violate the Establishment Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer concluded that this is a difficult borderline case where none of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s various tests for evaluating Establishment Clause questions can substitute for the exercise of legal judgment.  See, <em>e.g., School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html"></a><a href="/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a>, 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  That judgment is not a personal judgment.  Rather, as in all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to the underlying purposes of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Religion Clauses\xe2\x80\x94to assure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all, to avoid the religious divisiveness that promotes social conflict, and to maintain the separation of church and state.  No exact formula can dictate a resolution to fact-intensive cases such as this.  Despite the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 religious message, an inquiry into the context in which the text of the Commandments is used demonstrates that the Commandments also convey a secular moral message about proper standards of social conduct and a message about the historic relation between those standards and the law.  The circumstances surrounding the monument\xe2\x80\x99s placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 text as used on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message.  The determinative factor here, however, is that 40 years passed in which the monument\xe2\x80\x99s presence, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner).  Those 40 years<font b="1"> suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their belief systems, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to establish religion.  See <em>ibid.  </em>The public visiting the capitol grounds is more likely to have considered the religious aspect of the tablets\xe2\x80\x99 message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.  For these reasons, the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line.

We hold that it does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 22 acres surrounding the Texas State Capitol contain 17 monuments and 21 historical markers commemorating the \xe2\x80\x9cpeople, ideals, and events that compose Texan identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg. (2001).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The monolith challenged here stands 6-feet high and 3-feet wide.  It is located to the north of the Capitol building, between the Capitol and the Supreme Court building.  Its primary content is the text of the Ten Commandments.  An eagle grasping the American flag, an eye inside of a pyramid, and two small tablets with what appears to be an ancient script are carved above the text of the Ten Commandments.  Below the text are two Stars of David and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho, which represent Christ.  The bottom of the monument bears the inscription \xe2\x80\x9cPRESENTED TO THE PEOPLE AND YOUTH OF TEXAS BY THE FRATERNAL ORDER OF EAGLES OF TEXAS 1961.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 21.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legislative record surrounding the State\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the monument from the Eagles\xe2\x80\x94a national social, civic, and patriotic organization\xe2\x80\x94is limited to legislative journal entries.  After the monument was accepted, the State selected a site for the monument based on the recommendation of the state organization responsible for maintaining the Capitol grounds.  The Eagles paid the cost of erecting the monument, the dedication of which was presided over by two state legislators.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Thomas Van Orden is a native Texan and a resident of Austin.  At one time he was a licensed lawyer, having graduated from Southern Methodist Law School.  Van Orden testified that, since 1995, he has encountered the Ten Commandments monument during his frequent visits to the Capitol grounds.  His visits are typically for the purpose of using the law library in the Supreme Court building, which is located just northwest of the Capitol building.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Forty years after the monument\xe2\x80\x99s erection and six years after Van Orden began to encounter the monument frequently, he sued numerous state officials in their official capacities under Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, seeking both a declaration that the monument\xe2\x80\x99s placement violates the Establishment Clause and an injunction requiring its removal.  After a bench trial, the District Court held that the monument did not contravene the Establishment Clause.  It found that the State had a valid secular purpose in recognizing and commending the Eagles for their efforts to reduce juvenile delinquency.  The District Court also determined that a reasonable observer, mindful of the history, purpose, and context, would not conclude that this passive monument conveyed the message that the State was seeking to endorse religion.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings with respect to the monument\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and effect.  351 F.\xc2\xa03d 173 (CA5 2003).  We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now affirm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases, Januslike, point in two directions in applying the Establishment Clause.  One face looks toward the strong role played by religion and religious traditions throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.  As we observed in <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html"></a><a href="/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a> (1963):</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true that religion has been closely identified with our history and government\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. The fact that the Founding Fathers believed devotedly that there was a God and that the unalienable rights of man were rooted in Him is clearly evidenced in their writings, from the Mayflower Compact to the Constitution itself\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. It can be truly said, therefore, that today, as in the beginning, our national life reflects a religious people who, in the words of Madison, are \xe2\x80\x98earnestly praying, as \xe2\x80\xa6 in duty bound, that the Supreme Lawgiver of the Universe \xe2\x80\xa6 guide them into every measure which may be worthy of his [blessing \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.</em>, at 212\xe2\x80\x93213.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe other face looks toward the principle that governmental intervention in religious matters can itself endanger religious freedom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, like all Establishment Clause challenges, presents us with the difficulty of respecting both faces.  Our institutions presuppose a Supreme Being, yet these institutions must not press religious observances upon their citizens.  One face looks to the past in acknowledgment of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage, while the other looks to the present in demanding a separation between church and state.  Reconciling these two faces requires that we neither abdicate our responsibility to maintain a division between church and state nor evince a hostility to religion by disabling the government from in some ways recognizing our religious heritage:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [W]e find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Zorach</em> v. <em>Clauson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/index.html"></a><a href="/us/343/306/index.html">343 U.

Yet, just two years after <em>Lemon</em> was decided, we noted that the factors identified in <em>Lemon</em> serve as \xe2\x80\x9cno more than helpful signposts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>McNair,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/734/index.html">413 U.

Others have applied it only after concluding that the challenged practice was invalid under a different Establishment Clause test.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever may be the fate of the <em>Lemon</em> test in the larger scheme of Establishment Clause jurisprudence, we think it not useful in dealing with the sort of passive monument that Texas has erected on its Capitol grounds.  Instead, our analysis is driven both by the nature of the monument and by our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>Lynch </em>v.<em> Donnelly, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html">465 U.

For example, both Houses passed resolutions in 1789 asking President George Washington to issue a Thanksgiving Day Proclamation to \xe2\x80\x9crecommend to the people of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer, to be observed by acknowledging, with grateful hearts, the many and signal favors of Almighty God.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong. 90, 914.

Such acknowledgments of the role played by the Ten Commandments in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage are common throughout America.  We need only look within our own Courtroom.  Since 1935, Moses has stood, holding two tablets that reveal portions of the Ten Commandments written in Hebrew, among other lawgivers in the south frieze.  Representations of the Ten Commandments adorn the metal gates lining the north and south sides of the Courtroom as well as the doors leading into the Courtroom.  Moses also sits on the exterior east facade of the building holding the Ten Commandments tablets.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similar acknowledgments can be seen throughout a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s tour of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Capital.  For example, a large statue of Moses holding the Ten Commandments, alongside a statue of the Apostle Paul, has overlooked the rotunda of the Library of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 Jefferson Building since 1897.  And the Jefferson Building\xe2\x80\x99s Great Reading Room contains a sculpture of a woman beside the Ten Commandments with a quote above her from the Old Testament (Micah 6:8).  A medallion with two tablets depicting the Ten Commandments decorates the floor of the National Archives.  Inside the Department of Justice, a statue entitled \xe2\x80\x9cThe Spirit of Law\xe2\x80\x9d has two tablets representing the Ten Commandments lying at its feet.  In front of the Ronald Reagan Building is another sculpture that includes a depiction of the Ten Commandments.  So too a 24-foot-tall sculpture, depicting, among other things, the Ten Commandments and a cross, stands outside the federal courthouse that houses both the Court of Appeals and the District Court for the District of Columbia.  Moses is also prominently featured in the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our opinions, like our building, have recognized the role the Decalogue plays in America\xe2\x80\x99s heritage.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 366 U. S., at 442; <em>id.</em>, at 462 (separate opinion of Frankfurter, J.).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The Executive and Legislative Branches have also acknowledged the historical role of the Ten Commandments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Public Papers of the Presidents, Harry S. Truman, 1950, p. 157 (1965); S. Con. Res. 13, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997); H. Con. Res. 31, 105th Cong., 1st Sess. (1997).  These displays and recognitions of the Ten Commandments bespeak the rich American tradition of religious acknowledgments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the Ten Commandments are religious\xe2\x80\x94they were so viewed at their inception and so remain.  The monument, therefore, has religious significance.  According to Judeo-Christian belief, the Ten Commandments were given to Moses by God on Mt. Sinai.  But Moses was a lawgiver as well as a religious leader.  And the Ten Commandments have an undeniable historical meaning, as the foregoing examples demonstrate.  Simply having religious content or promoting a message consistent with a religious doctrine does not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.  See <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly</em>, 465 U. S., at 680, 687; <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers, </em>463 U. S.,<em> </em>at 792; <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 437\xe2\x80\x93440; <em>Walz</em> v. <em>Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/index.html"></a><a href="/us/397/664/index.html">397 U.

For example, we held unconstitutional a Kentucky statute requiring the posting of the Ten Commandments in every public schoolroom.  <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html"></a><a href="/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a> (1980) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  In the classroom context, we found that the Kentucky statute had an improper and plainly religious purpose.  <em>Id.</em>, at 41.  As evidenced by <em>Stone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s almost exclusive reliance upon two of our school prayer cases, <em>id.</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (citing <em>School Dist. of Abington Township </em>v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html"></a><a href="/us/374/203/index.html">374 U.

Indeed, <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Aguillard</em> recognized that <em>Stone</em>\xe2\x80\x94along with <em>Schempp</em> and <em>Engel</em>\xe2\x80\x94was a consequence of the \xe2\x80\x9cparticular concerns that arise in the context of public elementary and secondary schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  482 U.

Indeed, Van Orden, the petitioner here, apparently walked by the monument for a number of years before bringing this lawsuit.  The monument is therefore also quite different from the prayers involved in <em>Schempp</em> and <em>Lee </em>v.<em> Weisman</em>.  Texas has treated her Capitol grounds monuments as representing the several strands in the State\xe2\x80\x99s political and legal history.  The inclusion of the Ten Commandments monument in this group has a dual significance, partaking of both religion and government.

And \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment practices that have nothing to do with creating or maintaining \xe2\x80\xa6 coercive state establishments\xe2\x80\x9d simply do not \xe2\x80\x9cimplicate the possible liberty interest of being free from coercive state establishments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newdow</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 53 (Thomas, J., concurring in\njudgment). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that, based on the original meaning of the Establishment Clause, the Ten Commandments display at issue here is constitutional.  In no sense does Texas compel petitioner Van Orden to do anything.  The only injury to him is that he takes offense at seeing the monument as he passes it on his way to the Texas Supreme Court Library.  He need not stop to read it or even to look at it, let alone to express support for it or adopt the Commandments as guides for his life.  The mere presence of the monument along his path involves no coercion and thus does not violate the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Returning to the original meaning would do more than simplify our task.  It also would avoid the pitfalls present in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s current approach to such challenges.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent elevates the trivial to the proverbial \xe2\x80\x9cfederal case,\xe2\x80\x9d by making benign signs and postings subject to challenge.  Yet even as it does so, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent attempts to avoid declaring all religious symbols and words of longstanding tradition unconstitutional, by counterfactually declaring them of little religious significance.  Even when the Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases recognize that such symbols have religious meaning, they adopt an unhappy compromise that fails fully to account for either the adherent\xe2\x80\x99s or the nonadherent\xe2\x80\x99s beliefs, and provides no principled way to choose between them.  Even worse, the incoherence of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in this area renders the Establishment Clause impenetrable and incapable of consistent application.  All told, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence leaves courts, governments, and believers and nonbelievers alike confused\xe2\x80\x94an observation that is hardly new.  See <em>Newdow</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 45, n.\xc2\xa01 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent permits even the slightest public recognition of religion to constitute an establishment of religion.  For example, individuals frequenting a county courthouse have successfully challenged as an Establishment Clause violation a sign at the courthouse alerting the public that the building was closed for Good Friday and containing a 4-inch high crucifix.  <em>Granzeier</em> v. <em>Middleton</em>, 955 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 741, 743, and n.\xc2\xa02, 746\xe2\x80\x93747 (ED Ky. 1997), aff\xe2\x80\x99d on other grounds, 173 F.\xc2\xa03d 568, 576 (CA6 1999).  Similarly, a park ranger has claimed that a cross erected to honor World War I veterans on a rock in the Mojave Desert Preserve violated the Establishment Clause, and won.  See <em>Buono</em> v. <em>Norton</em>, 212 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1202, 1204\xe2\x80\x931205, 1215\xe2\x80\x931217 (CD Cal. 2002).  If a cross in the middle of a desert establishes a religion, then no religious observance is safe from challenge.  Still other suits have charged that city seals containing religious symbols violate the Establishment Clause.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>Edmond</em>, 68 F.\xc2\xa03d 1226 (CA10 1995); <em>Murray</em> v. <em>Austin</em>, 947 F.\xc2\xa02d 147 (CA5 1991); <em>Friedman</em> v. <em>Board of Cty. Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs of Bernalillo Cty.</em>, 781 F.\xc2\xa02d 777 (CA10 1985) (en banc).  In every instance, the litigants are mere \xe2\x80\x9c[p]assersby \xe2\x80\xa6 free to ignore [such symbols or signs], or even to turn their backs, just as they are free to do when they disagree with any other form of government speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 664 (1989) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, in a seeming attempt to balance out its willingness to consider almost any acknowledgment of religion an establishment, in other cases Members of this Court have concluded that the term or symbol at issue has no religious meaning by virtue of its ubiquity or rote ceremonial invocation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 630\xe2\x80\x93631 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring); <em>Lynch </em>v.<em> Donnelly,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 716\xe2\x80\x93717 (1984) (Brennan, J., dissenting).  But words such as \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d have religious significance.  For example, just last Term this Court had before it a challenge to the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance, which includes the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cone Nation under God.\xe2\x80\x9d  The declaration that our country is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98one Nation under God\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily \xe2\x80\x9centail[s] an affirmation that God exists.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Newdow</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 48 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment).  This phrase is thus anathema to those who reject God\xe2\x80\x99s existence and a validation of His existence to those who accept it.  Telling either nonbelievers or believers that the words \xe2\x80\x9cunder God\xe2\x80\x9d have no meaning contradicts what they know to be true.  Moreover, repetition does not deprive religious words or symbols of their traditional meaning.  Words like \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d are not vulgarities for which the shock value diminishes with each successive utterance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even when this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents recognize the religious meaning of symbols or words, that recognition fails to respect fully religious belief or disbelief.  This Court looks for the meaning to an observer of indeterminate religious affiliation who knows all the facts and circumstances surrounding a challenged display.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.</em> v. <em>Pinette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/753/index.html">515 U. S. 753</a>, 780 (1995) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (presuming that a reasonable observer is \xe2\x80\x9caware of the history and context of the community and forum in which the religious display appears\xe2\x80\x9d).  In looking to the view of this unusually informed observer, this Court inquires whether the sign or display \xe2\x80\x9csends the ancillary message to \xe2\x80\xa6 nonadherents \xe2\x80\x98that they are outsiders, not full members of the political community, and an accompanying message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the political community.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em> v. <em>Doe, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/290/index.html">530 U. S. 290</a>, 309\xe2\x80\x93310 (2000) (quoting <em>Lynch,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 688 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This analysis is not fully satisfying to either nonadherents or adherents.  For the nonadherent, who may well be more sensitive than the hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9creasonable observer,\xe2\x80\x9d or who may not know all the facts, this test fails to capture completely the honest and deeply felt offense he takes from the government conduct.  For the adherent, this analysis takes no account of the message sent by removal of the sign or display, which may well appear to him to be an act hostile to his religious faith.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s foray into religious meaning either gives insufficient weight to the views of nonadherents and adherents alike, or it provides no principled way to choose between those views.  In sum, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s effort to assess religious meaning is fraught with futility.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the very \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Establishment Clause precedent leaves it incapable of consistent application.  See <em>Edwards</em> v. <em>Aguillard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/578/index.html">482 U. S. 578</a>, 640 (1987) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (criticizing the <em>Lemon</em> test\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe absence of any principled rationale\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The inconsistency between the decisions the Court reaches today in this case and in <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.</em>, <em>post</em>, p. \xe2\x80\x94, only compounds the confusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unintelligibility of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent raises the further concern that, either in appearance or in fact, adjudication of Establishment Clause challenges turns on judicial predilections.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Harris</em> v. <em>Zion, Lake Cty., Ill.</em>, 927 F.\xc2\xa02d 1401, 1425 (CA7 1991) (Easterbrook, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cLine drawing in this area will be erratic and heavily influenced by the personal views of the judges\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>post</em>, at 3 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI see no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal judgment\xe2\x80\x9d).  The outcome of constitutional cases ought to rest on firmer grounds than the personal preferences of judges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Much, if not all, of this would be avoided if the Court would return to the views of the Framers and adopt coercion as the touchstone for our Establishment Clause inquiry.  Every acknowledgment of religion would not give rise to an Establishment Clause claim.  Courts would not act as theological commissions, judging the meaning of religious matters.  Most important, our precedent would be capable of consistent and coherent application.  While the Court correctly rejects the challenge to the Ten Commandments monument on the Texas Capitol grounds, a more fundamental rethinking of our Establishment Clause jurisprudence remains in order.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U.

They seek to \xe2\x80\x9cassure the fullest possible scope of religious liberty and tolerance for all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 305.  They seek to avoid that divisiveness based upon religion that promotes social conflict, sapping the strength of government and religion alike.  <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U.

They seek to further the basic principles set forth today by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor in her concurring opinion in <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.</em>, <em>post, </em>at 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has made clear, as Justices Goldberg and Harlan noted, that the realization of these goals means that government must \xe2\x80\x9cneither engage in nor compel religious practices,\xe2\x80\x9d that it must \xe2\x80\x9ceffect no favoritism among sects or between religion and nonreligion,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it must \xe2\x80\x9cwork deterrence of no religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schempp,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 305 (concurring opinion); see also <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a>, 587 (1992); <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html">330 U. S. 1</a>, 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (1947).  The government must avoid excessive interference with, or promotion of, religion.  See generally <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 593\xe2\x80\x93594 (1989); <em>Zelman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 723\xe2\x80\x93725 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  But the Establishment Clause does not compel the government to purge from the public sphere all that in any way partakes of the religious.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a> (1983).  Such absolutism is not only inconsistent with our national traditions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/index.html">403 U. S. 602</a>, 614 (1971); <em>Lynch </em>v. <em>Donnelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 672\xe2\x80\x93678 (1984), but would also tend to promote the kind of social conflict the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, as Justices Goldberg and Harlan pointed out, the Court has found no single mechanical formula that can accurately draw the constitutional line in every case.  See <em>Schempp</em>, 374 U. S., at 306 (concurring opinion).  Where the Establishment Clause is at issue, tests designed to measure \xe2\x80\x9cneutrality\xe2\x80\x9d alone are insufficient, both because it is sometimes difficult to determine when a legal rule is \xe2\x80\x9cneutral,\xe2\x80\x9d and because</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cuntutored devotion to the concept of neutrality can lead to invocation or approval of results which partake not simply of that noninterference and noninvolvement with the religious which the Constitution commands, but of a brooding and pervasive devotion to the secular and a passive, or even active, hostility to the religious.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither can this Court\xe2\x80\x99s other tests readily explain the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s tolerance, for example, of the prayers that open legislative meetings, see Marsh, supra;</em> certain references to, and invocations of, the Deity in the public words of public officials; the public references to God on coins, decrees, and buildings; or the attention paid to the religious objectives of certain holidays, including Thanksgiving.

And in such cases, I see no test-related substitute for the exercise of legal judgment.  See <em>Schempp, supra</em>, at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring);<em> </em>cf. <em>Zelman,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 726\xe2\x80\x93728 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (need for similar exercise of judgment where quantitative considerations matter).  That judgment is not a personal judgment.  Rather, as in all constitutional cases, it must reflect and remain faithful to the underlying purposes of the Clauses, and it must take account of context and consequences measured in light of those purposes.  While the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior tests provide useful guideposts\xe2\x80\x94and might well lead to the same result the Court<font b="1"> reaches today, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lemon</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 612\xe2\x80\x93613; <em>Capitol Square, supra</em>, at 773\xe2\x80\x93783 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment)\xe2\x80\x94no exact formula can dictate a resolution to such fact-intensive cases.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The case before us is a borderline case.  It concerns a large granite monument bearing the text of the Ten Commandments located on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.  On the one hand, the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 text undeniably has a religious message, invoking, indeed emphasizing, the Diety.  On the other hand, focusing on the text of the Commandments alone cannot conclusively resolve this<font b="1"> case.  Rather, to determine the message that the text here conveys, we must examine how the text is <em>used</em>.  And that inquiry requires us to consider the context of the display.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In certain contexts, a display of the tablets of the Ten Commandments can convey not simply a religious message but also a secular moral message (about proper standards of social conduct).  And in certain contexts, a display of the tablets can also convey a historical message (about a historic relation between those standards and the law)\xe2\x80\x94a fact that helps to explain the display of those tablets in dozens of courthouses throughout the Nation, including the Supreme Court of the United States.  See generally App. to Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 1a\xe2\x80\x937a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the tablets have been used as part of a display that communicates not simply a religious message, but a secular message as well.  The circumstances surrounding the display\xe2\x80\x99s placement on the capitol grounds and its physical setting suggest that the State itself intended the latter, nonreligious aspects of the tablets\xe2\x80\x99 message to predominate.  And the monument\xe2\x80\x99s 40-year history on the Texas state grounds indicates that that has been its effect. <font b="1"> </font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The group that donated the monument, the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a private civic (and primarily secular) organization, while interested in the religious aspect of the Ten Commandments, sought to highlight the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 role in shaping civic morality as part of that organization\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to combat juvenile delinquency.  See 1961 Tex. Gen. Laws 1995.  The Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 consultation with a committee composed of members of several faiths in order to find a nonsectarian text underscores the group\xe2\x80\x99s ethics-based motives.  See Brief for Respondents 5\xe2\x80\x936, and n.\xc2\xa09.  The tablets, as displayed on the monument, prominently acknowledge that the Eagles donated the display, a factor which, though not sufficient, thereby further distances the State itself from the religious aspect of the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 message.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The physical setting of the monument, moreover, suggests little or nothing of the sacred.  See Appendix A, <em>infra.</em>  The monument sits in a large park containing 17 monuments and 21 historical markers, all designed to illustrate the \xe2\x80\x9cideals\xe2\x80\x9d of those who settled in Texas and of those who have lived there since that time.  Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg. (2001); see Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  The setting does not readily lend itself to meditation or any other religious activity.  But it does provide a context of history and moral ideals.  It (together with the display\xe2\x80\x99s inscription about its origin) communicates to visitors that the State sought to reflect moral principles, illustrating a relation between ethics and law that the State\xe2\x80\x99s citizens, historically speaking, have endorsed.  That is to say, the context suggests that the State<em> </em>intended the display\xe2\x80\x99s moral message\xe2\x80\x94an illustrative message reflecting the historical \xe2\x80\x9cideals\xe2\x80\x9d of Texans\xe2\x80\x94to predominate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If these factors provide a strong, but not conclusive, indication that the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 text on this monument conveys a predominantly secular message, a further factor is determinative here.   As far as I can tell, 40 years passed in which the presence of this monument, legally speaking, went unchallenged (until the single legal objection raised by petitioner).  And I am not aware of any evidence suggesting that this was due to a climate of intimidation.  Hence, those 40 years<font b="1"> suggest more strongly than can any set of formulaic tests that few individuals, whatever their system of beliefs, are likely to have understood the monument as amounting, in any significantly detrimental way, to a government effort to favor a particular religious sect, primarily to promote religion over nonreligion, to \xe2\x80\x9cengage in\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9creligious practic[e],\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ccompel\xe2\x80\x9d any \xe2\x80\x9creligious practic[e],\xe2\x80\x9d  or to \xe2\x80\x9cwork deterrence\xe2\x80\x9d of  any \xe2\x80\x9creligious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schempp,</em> 374 U. S., at 305 (Goldberg, J., concurring).  Those 40 years suggest that the public visiting the capitol grounds has considered the religious aspect of the tablets\xe2\x80\x99 message as part of what is a broader moral and historical message reflective of a cultural heritage.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, moreover, is distinguishable from instances where the Court has found Ten Commandments displays impermissible.  The display is not on the grounds of a public school, where, given the impressionability of the young, government must exercise particular care in separating church and state.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Weisman,</em> 505 U. S., at 592; <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a> (1980) <em>(per curiam)</em>.   This case also differs from <em>McCreary County</em>, where the short (and stormy) history of the courthouse Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 displays demonstrates the substantially religious objectives of those who mounted them, and the effect of this readily apparent objective upon those who view them.  See, <em>post,</em> at 21\xe2\x80\x9325 (opinion of the Court).  That history there indicates a governmental effort substantially to promote religion, not simply an effort primarily to reflect, historically, the secular impact of a religiously inspired document.  And, in today\xe2\x80\x99s world, in a Nation of so many different religious and comparable nonreligious fundamental beliefs, a more contemporary state effort to focus attention upon a religious text is certainly likely to prove divisive in a way that this longstanding, pre-existing monument has not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I believe that the Texas display\xe2\x80\x94serving a mixed but primarily nonreligious purpose, not primarily \xe2\x80\x9cadvanc[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinhibit[ing] religion,\xe2\x80\x9d and not creating an \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive government entanglement with religion,\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94might satisfy this Court\xe2\x80\x99s more formal Establishment Clause tests.  <em>Lemon</em>, 403 U. S., at 612\xe2\x80\x93613 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Capitol Square</em>, 515 U. S., at 773\xe2\x80\x93783 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  But, as I have said, in reaching the conclusion that the Texas display falls on the permissible side of the constitutional line, I rely less upon a literal application of any particular test than upon consideration of the basic purposes of the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Religion Clauses themselves.  This display has stood apparently uncontested for nearly two generations.  That experience helps us understand that as a practical matter of <em>degree</em> this display is unlikely to prove divisive.  And this matter of degree is, I believe, critical in a borderline case such as this one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, to reach a contrary conclusion here, based primarily upon on the religious nature of the tablets\xe2\x80\x99 text would, I fear, lead the law to exhibit a hostility toward religion that has no place in our Establishment Clause traditions.  Such a holding might well encourage disputes concerning the removal of longstanding depictions of the Ten Commandments from public buildings across the Nation.  And it could thereby create the very kind of religiously based divisiveness that the Establishment Clause seeks to avoid.  <em>Zelman</em>, 536 U. S., at 717\xe2\x80\x93729 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justices Goldberg and Harlan concluded in <em>Schempp</em> that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he First Amendment does not prohibit practices which by any realistic measure create none of the dangers which it is designed to prevent and which do not so directly or substantially involve the state in religious exercise or in the favoring of religion as to have meaningful and practical impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  374 U.

S. 398</a> (1963), the Establishment Clause requires neutrality as a general rule, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Everson</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Ewing</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/index.html">330 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1947), and thus expresses Madison\xe2\x80\x99s condemnation of \xe2\x80\x9cemploy[ing] Religion as an engine of Civil policy,\xe2\x80\x9d Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, 2 Writings of James Madison 183, 187 (G. Hunt ed. 1901).  A governmental display of an obviously religious text cannot be squared with neutrality, except in a setting that plausibly indicates that the statement is not placed in view with a predominant purpose on the part of government either to adopt the religious message or to urge its acceptance by others.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, only one of our cases addressed the constitutionality of posting the Ten Commandments, <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a>, 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (1980) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  A Kentucky statute required posting the Commandments on the walls of public school classrooms, and the Court described the State\xe2\x80\x99s purpose (relevant under the tripartite test laid out in <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/index.html">403 U. S. 602</a> (1971)) as being at odds with the obligation of religious neutrality.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe pre-eminent purpose for posting the Ten Commandments on schoolroom walls is plainly religious in nature.  The Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths, and no legislative recitation of a supposed secular purpose can blind us to that fact.  The Commandments do not confine themselves to arguably secular matters, such as honoring one\xe2\x80\x99s parents, killing or murder, adultery, stealing, false witness, and covetousness. Rather, the first part of the Commandments concerns the religious duties of believers: worshipping the Lord God alone, avoiding idolatry, not using the Lord\xe2\x80\x99s name in vain, and observing the Sabbath Day.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S. at 41\xe2\x80\x9342 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhat these observations underscore are the simple realities that the Ten Commandments constitute a religious statement, that their message is inherently religious, and that the purpose of singling them out in a display is clearly the same.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, a pedestrian happening upon the monument at issue here needs no training in religious doctrine to realize that the statement of the Commandments, quoting God himself, proclaims that the will of the divine being is the source of obligation to obey the rules, including the facially secular ones.  In this case, moreover, the text is presented to give particular prominence to the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 first sectarian reference, \xe2\x80\x9cI am the Lord thy God.\xe2\x80\x9d  That proclamation is centered on the stone and written in slightly larger letters than the subsequent recitation.  To ensure that the religious nature of the monument is clear to even the most casual passerby, the word \xe2\x80\x9cLord\xe2\x80\x9d appears in all capital letters (as does the word \xe2\x80\x9cam\xe2\x80\x9d), so that the most eye-catching segment of the quotation is the declaration \xe2\x80\x9cI AM the LORD thy God.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 21.  What follows, of course, are the rules against other gods, graven images, vain swearing, and Sabbath breaking.  And the full text of the fifth Commandment puts forward filial respect as a condition of long life in the land \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the Lord they God giveth thee.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid.</em>  These \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ords \xe2\x80\xa6 make [the] \xe2\x80\xa6 religious meaning unmistakably clear.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U. S. 573</a>, 598 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To drive the religious point home, and identify the message as religious to any viewer who failed to read the text, the engraved quotation is framed by religious symbols: two tablets with what appears to be ancient script on them, two Stars of David, and the superimposed Greek letters Chi and Rho as the familiar monogram of Christ.  Nothing on the monument, in fact, detracts from its religious nature,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] see <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cHere, unlike in <em>Lynch</em> [v. <em>Donnelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a> (1984)], nothing in the context of the display detracts from the cr\xc4\x8dche\xe2\x80\x99s religious message\xe2\x80\x9d), and the plurality does not suggest otherwise.  It would therefore be difficult to miss the point that the government of Texas[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] is telling everyone who sees the monument to live up to a moral code because God requires it, with both code and conception of God being rightly understood as the inheritances specifically of Jews and Christians.  And it is likewise unsurprising that the District Court expressly rejected Texas\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the State\xe2\x80\x99s purpose in placing the monument on the capitol grounds was related to the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 role as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the foundation of modern secular law in Texas and elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 32.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The monument\xe2\x80\x99s presentation of the Commandments with<font b="1"> religious text emphasized and enhanced stands in contrast to any number of perfectly constitutional depictions of them, the frieze of our own Courtroom providing a good example, where the figure of Moses stands among history\xe2\x80\x99s great lawgivers.  While Moses holds the tablets of the Commandments showing some Hebrew text, no one looking at the lines of figures in marble relief is likely to see a religious purpose behind the assemblage or take away a religious message from it.  Only one other depiction represents a religious leader, and the historical personages are mixed with symbols of moral and intellectual abstractions like Equity and Authority.  See <em>County of Allegheny</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 652 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Since Moses enjoys no especial prominence on the frieze, viewers can readily take him to be there as a lawgiver in the company of other lawgivers; and the viewers may just as naturally see the tablets of the Commandments (showing the later ones, forbidding things like killing and theft, but without the divine preface) as background from which the concept of law emerged, ultimately having a secular influence in the history of the Nation.  Government may, of course, constitutionally call attention to this influence, and may post displays or erect monuments recounting this aspect of our history no less than any<font super="1"> other, so long as there is a context and that context is historical.  Hence, a display of the Commandments accompanied by an exposition of how they have influenced modern law would most likely be constitutionally unobjectionable.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  And the Decalogue could, as <em>Stone</em> suggested, be integrated constitutionally into a course of study in public schools.  <em>Stone, </em>449 U. S.<em>,</em> at 42.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</font></font></p><font b="1"><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Texas seeks to take advantage of the recognition that visual symbol and written text can manifest a secular purpose in secular company, when it argues that its monument (like Moses in the frieze) is not alone and ought to be viewed as only 1 among 17 placed on the 22 acres surrounding the state capitol.  Texas, indeed, says that the Capitol grounds are like a museum for a collection of exhibits, the kind of setting that several Members of the Court have said can render the exhibition of religious artifacts permissible, even though in other circumstances their display would be seen as meant to convey a religious message forbidden to the State.  <em>County of Allegheny, </em>492 U. S.<em>,</em> at 595 (opinion of Blackmun, J., joined by Stevens, J.); <em>Lynch</em> v. <em>Donnelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 692 (1984) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).  So, for example, the Government of the United States does not violate the Establishment Clause by hanging Giotto\xe2\x80\x99s Madonna on the wall of the National Gallery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But 17 monuments with no common appearance, history, or esthetic role scattered over 22 acres is not a museum, and anyone strolling around the lawn would surely take each memorial on its own terms without any dawning sense that some purpose held the miscellany together more coherently than fortuity and the edge of the grass.  One monument expresses admiration for pioneer women.  One pays respect to the fighters of World War II.  And one quotes the God of Abraham whose command is the sanction for moral law.  The themes are individual grit, patriotic courage, and God as the source of Jewish and Christian morality; there is no common denominator.  In like circumstances, we rejected an argument similar to the State\xe2\x80\x99s, noting in <em>County of Allegheny</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he presence of Santas or other Christmas decorations elsewhere in the . . . [c]ourthouse, and of the nearby gallery forum, fail to negate the [cr\xc4\x8dche\xe2\x80\x99s] endorsement effect. . . .  The record demonstrates . . . that the cr\xc4\x8dche, with its floral frame, was its own display distinct from any other decorations or exhibitions in the building.\xe2\x80\x9d  492 U. S., at 598\xe2\x80\x93599, n. 48.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the State\xe2\x80\x99s museum argument does nothing to blunt the religious message and manifestly religious purpose behind it, neither does the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on generalities culled from cases factually different from this one.  <em>E.g., ante,</em> at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have acknowledged, for example, that \xe2\x80\x98religion has been closely identified with our history and government,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>School Dist. of Abington Township</em> v. <em>Schempp,</em> 374 U.

S. 421</a>, 434 (1962)\xe2\x80\x9d).  In fact, it is not until the end of its opinion that the plurality turns to the relevant precedent of <em>Stone</em>, a case actually dealing with a display of the Decalogue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the plurality finally does confront <em>Stone,</em> it tries to avoid the case\xe2\x80\x99s obvious applicability by limiting its holding to the classroom setting.  The plurality claims to find authority for limiting <em>Stone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reach this way in the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s citations of two school-prayer cases, <em>School Dist. of Abington Township</em> v. <em>Schempp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/index.html">374 U. S. 203</a> (1963), and <em>Engel</em> v. <em>Vitale,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/index.html"></a><a href="/us/370/421/index.html">370 U. S. 421</a> (1962).  But <em>Stone </em>relied on those cases for widely applicable notions, not for any concept specific to schools.  The opinion quoted <em>Schempp</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>statements that \xe2\x80\x9cit is no defense to urge that the religious practices here may be relatively minor encroachments on the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Schempp, supra,</em> at 225, quoted in <em>Stone, </em>449 U. S.<em>, </em>at 42; and<em> </em>that \xe2\x80\x9cthe place of the Bible as an instrument of religion cannot be gainsaid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Schempp, supra,</em> at 224, quoted in <em>Stone, supra, </em>at 41, n.\xc2\xa03.  And <em>Engel</em> was cited to support the proposition that the State was responsible for displaying the Commandments, even though their framed, printed texts were bought with private subscriptions.  <em>Stone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 42 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mere posting of the [Commandments] under the auspices of the legislature provides the official support of the State Government that the Establishment Clause prohibits\xe2\x80\x9d (omission and internal quotation marks omitted)).  Thus, the schoolroom was beside the point of the citations, and that is presumably why the <em>Stone</em> Court failed to discuss the educational setting, as other opinions had done when school was significant.  <em>E.g., Edwards</em> v. <em>Aguillard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/578/index.html">482 U. S. 578</a>, 584 (1987).  <em>Stone</em> did not, for example, speak of children\xe2\x80\x99s impressionability or their captivity as an audience in a school class.  In fact, <em>Stone</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning reached the classroom only in noting the lack of support for the claim that the State had brought the Commandments into schools in order to \xe2\x80\x9cintegrat[e] [them] into the school curriculum.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U. S.<em>,</em> at 42.  Accordingly, our numerous prior discussions of <em>Stone</em> have never treated its holding as restricted to the classroom.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor can the plurality deflect <em>Stone</em> by calling the Texas monument \xe2\x80\x9ca far more passive use of [the Decalogue] than was the case in <em>Stone,</em> where the text confronted elementary school students every day.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 12.  Placing a monument on the ground is not more \xe2\x80\x9cpassive\xe2\x80\x9d than hanging a sheet of paper on a wall when both contain the same text to be read by anyone who<font b="1"> looks at it.  The problem in <em>Stone</em> was simply that the State was putting the Commandments there to be seen, just as the monument\xe2\x80\x99s inscription is there for those who walk by it.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s compulsory-education law meant that the schoolchildren were forced to see the display every day, whereas many see the monument by choice, and those who customarily walk the Capitol grounds can presumably avoid it if they choose.  But in my judgment (and under our often inexact Establishment Clause jurisprudence, such matters often boil down to judgment, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment)), this distinction should make no difference.  The monument in this case sits on the grounds of the Texas State Capitol.  There is something significant in the common term \xe2\x80\x9cstatehouse\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a state capitol building: it is the civic home of every one of the State\xe2\x80\x99s citizens.  If neutrality in religion means something, any citizen should be able to visit that civic home without having to confront religious expressions clearly meant to convey an official religious position that may be at odds with his own religion, or with rejection of religion.  See <em>County of Allegheny</em>, 492 U. S., at 626 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI agree that the cr\xc4\x8dche displayed on the Grand Staircase of the Allegheny County Courthouse, the seat of county government, conveys a message to nonadherents of Christianity that they are not full members of the political community \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  The display of religious symbols in public areas of core government buildings runs a special risk of making religion relevant, in reality or public perception, to status in the political community\xe2\x80\x9d (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, though this too is a point on which judgment will vary, I do not see a persuasive argument for constitutionality in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s observation that Van Orden\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit comes \xe2\x80\x9c[f]orty years after the monument\xe2\x80\x99s erection . . . ,\xe2\x80\x9d a<em>nte, </em>at 2, an observation that echoes the State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that one fact cutting in its favor is that \xe2\x80\x9cthe monument stood \xe2\x80\xa6 in Austin . . . for some forty years without generating any controversy or litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 25.  It is not that I think the passage of time is necessarily irrelevant in Establishment Clause analysis.  We have approved framing-era practices because they must originally have been understood as constitutionally permissible, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Marsh</em> v. <em>Chambers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/783/index.html">463 U. S. 783</a> (1983) (legislative prayer), and we have recognized that Sunday laws have grown recognizably secular<em> </em>over time, <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/index.html"></a><a href="/us/366/420/index.html">366 U. S. 420</a> (1961).  There is also an analogous argument, not yet evaluated, that ritualistic religious expression can become so numbing over time that its initial Establishment Clause violation becomes at some point too diminished for notice.  But I do not understand any of these to be the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument, which rather seems to be that 40 years without a challenge shows that as a factual matter the religious expression is too tepid to provoke a serious reaction and constitute a violation.  Perhaps, but the writer of Exodus chapter 20 was not lukewarm, and other explanations may do better in accounting for the late resort to the courts.  Suing a State over religion puts nothing in a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s pocket and can take a great deal out, and even with volunteer litigators to supply time and energy, the risk of social ostracism can be powerfully deterrent.  I doubt that a slow walk to the courthouse, even one that took 40 years, is much evidentiary help in applying the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The clarity of the religious manifestation in <em>Stone</em> was unaffected by the State\xe2\x80\x99s effort to obscure it: the Kentucky statute that mandated posting the Commandments in classrooms also required the addition to every posting of a notation reading, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he secular application of the Ten Commandments is clearly seen in its adoption as the fundamental legal code of Western Civilization and the Common Law of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U.

When the Fraternal Order of Eagles, the group that gave the monument to the State of Texas, donated identical monuments to other jurisdictions, it was seeking to impart a religious message.  See <em>Adland</em> v. <em>Russ</em>, 307 F.\xc2\xa03d 471, 475 (CA6 2002) (quoting the Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 statement in a letter written to Kentucky when a monument was donated to that Commonwealth: \xe2\x80\x9cMost of today\xe2\x80\x99s younger generation either have not seen the Ten Commandments or have not been taught them.  In our opinion the youth of today is in dire need of learning the simple laws of God . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, it was not just the terms of the moral code, but the proclamation that the terms of the code were enjoined by God, that the Eagles put forward in the monuments they donated.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0That the monument also surrounds the text of the Commandments with various American symbols (notably the U. S. flag and a bald eagle) only underscores the impermissibility of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s actions: by juxtaposing these patriotic symbols with the Commandments and other religious signs, the monument sends the message that being American means being religious (and not just being religious but also subscribing to the Commandments, <em>i.e.,</em> practicing a monotheistic religion).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0There is no question that the State in its own right is broadcasting the religious message.  When Texas accepted the monument from the Eagles, the state legislature, aware that the Eagles \xe2\x80\x9cfor the past several years have placed across the country . . . parchment plaques and granite monoliths of the Ten Commandments . . . [in order] to promote youth morality and help stop the alarming increase in delinquency,\xe2\x80\x9d resolved \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Fraternal Order of the Eagles of the State of Texas be commended and congratulated for its efforts and contributions in combating juvenile delinquency throughout our nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 97.  The State, then, expressly approved of the Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 proselytizing, which it made on its own.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For similar reasons, the other displays of the Commandments that the plurality mentions, <em>ante</em>, at 9, do not run afoul of the Establishment Clause.  The statues of Moses and St. Paul in the Main Reading Room of the Library of Congress are 2 of 16 set in close proximity, statues that \xe2\x80\x9crepresent men illustrious in the various forms of thought and activity \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Library of Congress: The Art and Architecture of the Thomas Jefferson Building 127 (J. Cole and H. Reeds eds. 1997).  Moses and St. Paul represent religion, while the other 14 (a group that includes Beethoven, Shakespeare, Michelangelo, Columbus, and Plato) represent the nonreligious categories of philosophy, art, history, commerce, science, law, and poetry.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Similarly, the sculpture of the woman beside the Decalogue in the Main Reading Room is one of 8 such figures \xe2\x80\x9crepresent[ing] eight characteristic features of civilized life and thought,\xe2\x80\x9d the same 8 features (7 of them nonreligious) that Moses, St. Paul, and the rest of the 16 statues represent.  <em>Id</em>., at 125.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The inlay on the floor of the National Archives Building is one of four such discs, the collective theme of which is not religious.  Rather, the discs \xe2\x80\x9csymbolize the various types of Government records that were to come into the National Archive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Letter from Judith A. Koucky, Archivist, Records Control Section to Catherine Millard, Oct. 1, 2003 (on file with Clerk of the Court).   (The four categories are war and defense, history, justice, and legislation.  Each disc is paired with a winged figure; the disc containing the depiction of the Commandments, a depiction that, notably, omits the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 text, is paired with a figure representing legislation.  <em>Ibid</em>.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for Moses\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cprominen[t] featur[ing] in the Chamber of the United States House of Representatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9 (plurality opinion), Moses is actually 1 of 23 portraits encircling the House Chamber, each approximately the same size, having no religious theme.  The portraits depict \xe2\x80\x9cmen noted in history for the part they played in the evolution of what has become American law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art in the United States Capitol 282; House Doc. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93660 (1978).  More importantly for purposes of this case, each portrait consists only of the subject\xe2\x80\x99s face; the Ten Commandments appear nowhere in Moses\xe2\x80\x99s portrait.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Similarly permissible, though obviously of a different character, are laws that can be traced back to the Commandments (even the more religious ones) but are currently supported by nonreligious considerations.  See <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.,</em> <em>post</em>, at 10 (opinion of the Court) (noting that in <em>McGowan</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/index.html"></a><a href="/us/366/420/index.html">366 U.

There the Commandments were posted at the behest of the county in the first instance, whereas the State of Texas received the monument as a gift from the Eagles, which apparently conceived of the donation at the suggestion of a movie producer bent on promoting his commercial film on the Ten Commandments, <em>Books</em> v. <em>Elkhart</em>, 235 F.\xc2\xa03d 292, 294\xe2\x80\x93295 (CA7 2000), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/1058/index.html">532 U. S. 1058</a> (2001).  But this distinction fails to neutralize the apparent expression of governmental intent to promote a religious message: although the nativity scene in <em>Allegheny County </em>was donated by the Holy Name Society, we concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o viewer could reasonably think that [the scene] occupies [its] location [at the seat of county government] without the support and approval of the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U.

The message transmitted by Texas\xe2\x80\x99 chosen display is quite plain: This State endorses the divine code of the \xe2\x80\x9cJudeo-Christian\xe2\x80\x9d God.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For those of us who learned to recite the King James version of the text long before we understood the meaning of some of its words, God\xe2\x80\x99s Commandments may seem like wise counsel.  The question before this Court, however, is whether it is counsel that the State of Texas may proclaim without violating the Establishment Clause of the Constitution.

S. 203</a>, 222 (1963)\xe2\x80\x94a negative answer to that question is mandatory.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my judgment, at the very least, the Establishment Clause has created a strong presumption against the display of religious symbols on public property.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>County of Allegheny </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Greater Pittsburgh Chapter</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/573/index.html"></a><a href="/us/492/573/index.html">492 U.

S. 753</a>, 797 (1995) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The adornment of our public spaces with displays of religious symbols and messages undoubtedly provides comfort, even inspiration, to many individuals who subscribe to particular faiths.  Unfortunately, the practice also runs the risk of \xe2\x80\x9coffend[ing] nonmembers of the faith being advertised as well as adherents who consider the particular advertisement disrespectful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to avoid divisiveness and exclusion in the religious sphere is compelled by the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses, which together erect a wall of separation between church and state.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  This metaphorical wall protects principles long recognized and often recited in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases.  The first and most fundamental of these principles, one that a majority of this Court today affirms, is that the Establishment Clause demands religious neutrality\xe2\x80\x94government may not exercise a preference for one religious faith over another.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>McCreary County </em>v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union, Ky.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 27\xe2\x80\x9329.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This essential command, however, is not merely a prohibition against the government\xe2\x80\x99s differentiation among religious sects.  We have repeatedly reaffirmed that neither a State nor the Federal Government \xe2\x80\x9ccan constitutionally pass laws or impose requirements which aid all religions as against non-believers, and neither can aid those religions based on a belief in the existence of God as against those religions founded on different beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Torcaso</em> v. <em>Watkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/488/index.html">367 U. S. 488</a>, 495 (1961) (footnote omitted).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This principle is based on the straightforward notion that governmental promotion of orthodoxy is not saved by the aggregation of several orthodoxies under the State\xe2\x80\x99s banner.  See <em>Abington</em>, 374 U. S., at 222.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Acknowledgments of this broad understanding of the neutrality principle are legion in our cases.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Strong arguments to the contrary have been raised from time to time, perhaps the strongest in then-Justice Rehnquist\xe2\x80\x99s scholarly dissent in <em>Wallace</em> v. <em>Jaffree</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/38/index.html"></a><a href="/us/472/38/index.html">472 U. S. 38</a>, 91\xe2\x80\x93114 (1985).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Powerful as his argument was, we squarely rejected it and thereby reaffirmed the principle that the Establishment Clause requires the same respect for the atheist as it does for the adherent of a Christian faith.  As we wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court has unambiguously concluded that the individual freedom of conscience protected by the First Amendment embodies the right to select any religious faith or none at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In restating this principle, I do not discount the importance of avoiding an overly strict interpretation of the metaphor so often used to define the reach of the Establishment Clause.  The plurality is correct to note that \xe2\x80\x9creligion and religious traditions\xe2\x80\x9d have played a \xe2\x80\x9cstrong role \xe2\x80\xa6 throughout our nation\xe2\x80\x99s history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  This Court has often recognized \xe2\x80\x9can unbroken history of official acknowledgment \xe2\x80\xa6 of the role of religion in American life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lynch</em> v.<em> Donnelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html"></a><a href="/us/465/668/index.html">465 U. S. 668</a>, 674 (1984); accord, <em>Edwards </em>v.<em> Aguillard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/578/index.html">482 U. S. 578</a>, 606\xe2\x80\x93608 (1987) (Powell, J., concurring).  Given this history, it is unsurprising that a religious symbol may at times become an important feature of a familiar landscape or a reminder of an important event in the history of a community.  The wall that separates the church from the State does not prohibit the government from acknowledging the religious beliefs and practices of the American people, nor does it require governments to hide works of art or historic memorabilia from public view just because they also have religious significance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, however, is not about historic preservation or the mere recognition of religion.  The issue is obfuscated rather than clarified by simplistic commentary on the various ways in which religion has played a role in American life, see <em>ante, </em>at 3\xe2\x80\x938 (plurality opinion), and by the recitation of the many extant governmental \xe2\x80\x9cacknowledgments\xe2\x80\x9d of the role the Ten Commandments played in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and n.\xc2\xa08.  Surely, the mere compilation of religious symbols, none of which includes the full text of the Commandments and all of which are exhibited in different settings, has only marginal relevance to the question presented in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The monolith displayed on Texas Capitol grounds cannot be discounted as a passive acknowledgment of religion, nor can the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to remove it upon objection be explained as a simple desire to preserve a historic relic.  This Nation\xe2\x80\x99s resolute commitment to neutrality with respect to religion is flatly inconsistent with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s wholehearted validation of an official state endorsement of the message that there is one, and only one, God.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When the Ten Commandments monument was donated to the State of Texas in 1961, it was not for the purpose of commemorating a noteworthy event in Texas history, signifying the Commandments\xe2\x80\x99 influence on the development of secular law, or even denoting the religious beliefs of Texans at that time.  To the contrary, the donation was only one of over a hundred largely identical monoliths, and of over a thousand paper replicas, distributed to state and local governments throughout the Nation over the course of several decades.  This ambitious project was the work of the Fraternal Order of Eagles, a well-respected benevolent organization whose good works have earned the praise of several Presidents.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the story goes, the program was initiated by the late Judge E. J. Ruegemer, a Minnesota juvenile court judge and then-Chairman of the Eagles National Commission on Youth Guidance.  Inspired by a juvenile offender who had never heard of the Ten Commandments, the judge approached the Minnesota Eagles with the idea of distributing paper copies of the Commandments to be posted in courthouses nationwide.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s Aerie undertook this project and its popularity spread.  When Cecil B. DeMille, who at that time was filming the movie The Ten Commandments, heard of the judge\xe2\x80\x99s endeavor, he teamed up with the Eagles to produce the type of granite monolith now displayed in front of the Texas Capitol and at courthouse squares, city halls, and public parks throughout the Nation.  Granite was reportedly chosen over DeMille\xe2\x80\x99s original suggestion of bronze plaques to better replicate the original Ten Commandments.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The donors were motivated by a desire to \xe2\x80\x9cinspire the youth\xe2\x80\x9d and curb juvenile delinquency by providing children with a \xe2\x80\x9ccode of conduct or standards by which to govern their actions.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  It is the Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 belief that disseminating the message conveyed by the Ten Commandments will help to persuade young men and women to observe civilized standards of behavior, and will lead to more productive lives.  Significantly, although the Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 organization is nonsectarian, eligibility for membership is premised on a belief in the existence of a \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme Being.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  As described by the Eagles themselves:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in searching for a youth guidance program, [we] recognized that there can be no better, no more defined program of Youth Guidance, and adult guidance as well, than the laws handed down by God Himself to Moses more than 3000 years ago, which laws have stood unchanged through the years.  They are a fundamental part of our lives, the basis of all our laws for living, the foundation of our relationship with our Creator, with our families and with our fellow men.

But achieving that goal through biblical teachings injects a religious purpose into an otherwise secular endeavor.  By spreading the word of God and converting heathens to Christianity, missionaries expect to enlighten their converts, enhance their satisfaction with life, and improve their behavior.  Similarly, by disseminating the \xe2\x80\x9claw of God\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94directing fidelity to God and proscribing murder, theft, and adultery\xe2\x80\x94the Eagles hope that this divine guidance will help wayward youths conform their behavior and improve their lives.  In my judgment, the significant secular by-products that are intended consequences of religious instruction\xe2\x80\x94indeed, of the establishment of most religions\xe2\x80\x94are not the type of \xe2\x80\x9csecular\xe2\x80\x9d purposes that justify government promulgation of sacred religious messages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the State of Texas may genuinely wish to combat juvenile delinquency, and may rightly want to honor the Eagles for their efforts, it cannot effectuate these admirable purposes through an explicitly religious medium.  See <em>Bowen</em> v. <em>Kendrick</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/589/index.html">487 U. S. 589</a>, 639\xe2\x80\x93640 (1988) (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt should be undeniable by now that religious dogma may not be employed by government even to accomplish laudable secular purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State may admonish its citizens not to lie, cheat or steal, to honor their parents and to respect their neighbors\xe2\x80\x99 property; and it may do so by printed words, in television commercials, or on granite monuments in front of its public buildings.  Moreover, the State may provide its schoolchildren and adult citizens with educational materials that explain the important role that our forebears\xe2\x80\x99 faith in God played in their decisions to select America as a refuge from religious persecution, to declare their independence from the British Crown, and to conceive a new Nation.  See <em>Edwards</em>, 482 U. S., at 606\xe2\x80\x93608 (Powell, J., concurring).  The message at issue in this case, however, is fundamentally different from either a bland admonition to observe generally accepted rules of behavior or a general history lesson.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The reason this message stands apart is that the Decalogue is a venerable religious text.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  As we held 25 years ago, it is beyond dispute that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Ten Commandments are undeniably a sacred text in the Jewish and Christian faiths.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Graham</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/39/index.html">449 U. S. 39</a>, 41 (1980) <em>(per curiam)</em> (footnote omitted).  For many followers, the Commandments represent the literal word of God as spoken to Moses and repeated to his followers after descending from Mount Sinai.  The message conveyed by the Ten Commandments thus cannot be analogized to an appendage to a common article of commerce (\xe2\x80\x9cIn God we Trust\xe2\x80\x9d) or an incidental part of a familiar recital (\xe2\x80\x9cGod save the United States and this honorable Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thankfully, the plurality does not attempt to minimize the religious significance of the Ten Commandments.<em>  Ante</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, the Ten Commandments are religious\xe2\x80\x94they were so viewed at their inception and so remain\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Thomas, J., concurring); see also <em>McCreary County</em> v. <em>American Civil Liberties Union of Ky.</em>, <em>post</em>, at 19 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Attempts to secularize what is unquestionably a sacred text defy credibility and disserve people of faith.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The profoundly sacred message embodied by the text inscribed on the Texas monument is emphasized by the especially large letters that identify its author: \xe2\x80\x9cI AM the LORD thy God.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Appendix, <em>infra</em>.  It commands present worship of Him and no other deity.  It directs us to be guided by His teaching in the current and future conduct of all of our affairs.  It instructs us to follow a code of divine law, some of which has informed and been integrated into our secular legal code (\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not kill\xe2\x80\x9d), but much of which has not (\xe2\x80\x9cThou shalt not make to thyself any graven images\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Thou shalt not covet\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, despite the Eagles\xe2\x80\x99 best efforts to choose a benign nondenominational text,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] the Ten Commandments display projects not just a religious, but an inherently sectarian message.  There are many distinctive versions of the Decalogue, ascribed to by different religions and even different denominations within a particular faith; to a pious and learned observer, these differences may be of enormous religious significance.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  See Lubet, The Ten Commandments in Alabama, 15 Constitutional Commentary 471, 474\xe2\x80\x93476 (Fall 1998).  In choosing to display this version of the Commandments, Texas tells the observer that the State supports this side of the doctrinal religious debate.  The reasonable observer, after all, has no way of knowing that this text was the product of a compromise, or that there is a rationale of any kind for the text\xe2\x80\x99s selection.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Establishment Clause, if nothing else, forbids government from \xe2\x80\x9cspecifying details upon which men and women who believe in a benevolent, omnipotent Creator and Ruler of the world are known to differ.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Weisman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/577/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/577/index.html">505 U. S. 577</a>, 641 (1992) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Given that the chosen text inscribed on the Ten Commandments monument invariably places the State at the center of a serious sectarian dispute, the display is unquestionably unconstitutional under our case law.  See <em>Larson</em> v. <em>Valente</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/228/index.html"></a><a href="/us/456/228/index.html">456 U. S. 228</a>, 244 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe clearest command of the Establishment Clause is that one religious denomination cannot be officially preferred over another\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if, however, the message of the monument, despite the inscribed text, fairly could be said to represent the belief system of all Judeo-Christians, it would still run afoul of the Establishment Clause by prescribing a compelled code of conduct from one God, namely a Judeo-Christian God, that is rejected by prominent polytheistic sects, such as Hinduism, as well as nontheistic religions, such as Buddhism.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 615 (opinion of Blackmun, J.) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe simultaneous endorsement of Judaism and Christianity is no less constitutionally infirm than the endorsement of Christianity alone\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, at the very least, the text of the Ten Commandments impermissibly commands a preference for religion over irreligion.  See, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 590 (The Establishment Clause \xe2\x80\x9cguarantee[s] religious liberty and equality to the \xe2\x80\x98infidel, the atheist, or the adherent of a non-Christian faith such as Islam or Judaism\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Wallace</em>, 472 U. S., at 52)).  Any of those bases, in my judgment, would be sufficient to conclude that the message should not be proclaimed by the State of Texas on a permanent monument at the seat of its government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not doubt that some Texans, including those elected to the Texas Legislature, may believe that the statues displayed on the Texas Capitol grounds, including the Ten Commandments monument, reflect the \xe2\x80\x9cideals . . . that compose Texan identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. H. Con. Res. 38, 77th Leg. 6473 (2001).  But Texas, like our entire country, is now a much more diversified community than it was when it became a part of the United States or even when the monument was erected.  Today there are many Texans who do not believe in the God whose Commandments are displayed at their seat of government.  Many of them worship a different god or no god at all.  Some may believe that the account of the creation in the Book of Genesis is less reliable than the views of men like Darwin and Einstein.  The monument is no more an expression of the views of every true Texan than was the \xe2\x80\x9cLive Free or Die\xe2\x80\x9d motto that the State of New Hampshire placed on its license plates in 1969 an accurate expression of the views of every citizen of New Hampshire.  See <em>Wooley</em> v. <em>Maynard,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/705/index.html">430 U. S. 705</a> (1977).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recognizing the diversity of religious and secular beliefs held by Texans and by all Americans, it seems beyond peradventure that allowing the seat of government to serve as a stage for the propagation of an unmistakably Judeo-Christian message of piety would have the tendency to make nonmonotheists and nonbelievers \xe2\x80\x9cfeel like [outsiders] in matters of faith, and [strangers] in the political community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pinette</em>, 515 U. S., at 799 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]isplays of this kind inevitably have a greater tendency to emphasize sincere and deeply felt differences among individuals than to achieve an ecumenical goal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 651 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even more than the display of a religious symbol on government property, see <em>Pinette</em>, 515 U. S., at 797 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 650\xe2\x80\x93651 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), displaying this sectarian text at the state capitol should invoke a powerful presumption of invalidity.  As Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s opinion persuasively demonstrates, the physical setting in which the Texas monument is displayed\xe2\x80\x94far from rebutting that presumption\xe2\x80\x94actually enhances the religious content of its message.  See <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  The monument\xe2\x80\x99s permanent fixture at the seat of Texas government is of immense significance.  The fact that a monument:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cis installed on public property implies official recognition and reinforcement of its message.  That implication is especially strong when the sign stands in front of the seat of government itself.  The \xe2\x80\x98reasonable observer\xe2\x80\x99 of any symbol placed unattended in front of any capitol in the world will normally assume that the sovereign\xe2\x80\x94which is not only the owner of that parcel of real estate but also the lawgiver for the surrounding territory\xe2\x80\x94has sponsored and facilitated its message.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pinette</em>, 515 U. S., at 801\xe2\x80\x93802 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Critical examination of the Decalogue\xe2\x80\x99s prominent display at the seat of Texas government, rather than generic citation to the role of religion in American life, unmistakably reveals on which side of the \xe2\x80\x9cslippery slope,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), this display must fall.  God, as the author of its message, the Eagles, as the donor of the monument, and the State of Texas, as its proud owner, speak with one voice for a common purpose\xe2\x80\x94to encourage Texans to abide by the divine code of a \xe2\x80\x9cJudeo-Christian\xe2\x80\x9d God.  If this message is permissible, then the shining principle of neutrality to which we have long adhered is nothing more than mere shadow.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality relies heavily on the fact that our Republic was founded, and has been governed since its nascence, by leaders who spoke then (and speak still) in plainly religious rhetoric.  The Chief Justice cites, for instance, George Washington\xe2\x80\x99s 1789 Thanksgiving Proclamation in support of the proposition that the Establishment Clause does not proscribe official recognition of God\xe2\x80\x99s role in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s heritage, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Further, the plurality emphatically endorses the seemingly timeless recognition that our \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutions presuppose a Supreme Being,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 4.  Many of the submissions made to this Court by the parties and <em>amici</em>, in accord with the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,<em> </em>have relied on the ubiquity of references to God throughout our history.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The speeches and rhetoric characteristic of the founding era, however, do not answer the question before us.  I have already explained why Texas\xe2\x80\x99 display of the full text of the Ten Commandments, given the content of the actual display and the context in which it is situated, sets this case apart from the countless examples of benign government recognitions of religion.  But there is another crucial difference.  Our leaders, when delivering public addresses, often express their blessings simultaneously in the service of God and their constituents.  Thus, when public officials deliver public speeches, we recognize that their words are not exclusively a transmission from <em>the</em> government because those oratories have embedded within them the inherently personal views of the speaker as an individual member of the polity.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  The permanent placement of a textual religious display on state property is different in kind; it amalgamates otherwise discordant individual views into a collective statement of government approval.  Moreover, the message never ceases to transmit itself to objecting viewers whose only choices are to accept the message or to ignore the offense by averting their gaze.  Cf. <em>Allegheny County</em>, 492 U. S., at 664 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); <em>ante</em>, at 4 (Thomas, J., concurring).  In this sense, although Thanksgiving Day proclamations and inaugural speeches undoubtedly seem official, in most circumstances they will not constitute the sort of governmental endorsement of religion at which the separation of church and state is aimed.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on early religious statements and proclamations made by the Founders is also problematic because those views were not espoused at the Constitutional Convention in 1787[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] nor enshrined in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Thus, the presentation of these religious statements as a unified historical narrative is bound to paint a misleading picture.  It does so here.  In according deference to the statements of George Washington and John Adams, The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia, see <em>ante</em>, at 7 (plurality opinion); <em>McCreary County</em>, <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion), fail to account for the acts and publicly espoused views of other influential leaders of that time.  Notably absent from their historical snapshot is the fact that Thomas Jefferson refused to issue the Thanksgiving proclamations that Washington had so readily embraced based on the argument that to do so would violate the Establishment Clause.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia disregard the substantial debates that took place regarding the constitutionality of the early proclamations and acts they cite, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Letter from James Madison to Edward Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution 105\xe2\x80\x93106 (P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987) (hereinafter Founders\xe2\x80\x99 Constitution) (arguing that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 appointment of Chaplains to be paid from the National Treasury was \xe2\x80\x9cnot with my approbation\xe2\x80\x9d and was a \xe2\x80\x9cdeviation\xe2\x80\x9d from the principle of \xe2\x80\x9cimmunity of Religion from civil jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d),[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] and paper over the fact that Madison more than once repudiated the views attributed to him by many, stating unequivocally that with respect to government\xe2\x80\x99s involvement with religion, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98tendency to a usurpation on one side, or the other, or to a corrupting coalition or alliance between them, will be best guarded against by an entire abstinence of the Government from interference, in any way whatever, beyond the necessity of preserving public order, &amp; protecting each sect against trespasses on its legal rights by others.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These seemingly nonconforming sentiments should come as no surprise.  Not insignificant numbers of colonists came to this country with memories of religious persecution by monarchs on the other side of the Atlantic.  See A. Stokes &amp; L. Pfeffer, Church and State in the United States 3\xe2\x80\x9323 (rev. ed. 1964).  Others experienced religious intolerance at the hands of colonial Puritans, who regrettably failed to practice the tolerance that some of their contemporaries preached.  <em>Engel</em> v. <em>Vitale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/index.html"></a><a href="/us/370/421/index.html">370 U. S. 421</a>, 427\xe2\x80\x93429 (1962).  The Chief Justice and Justice Scalia ignore the separationist impulses\xe2\x80\x94in accord with the principle of \xe2\x80\x9cneutrality\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that these individuals brought to the debates surrounding the adoption of the Establishment Clause.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ardent separationists aside, there is another critical nuance lost in the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s portrayal of history.  Simply put, many of the Founders who are often cited as authoritative expositors of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning understood the Establishment Clause to stand for a <em>narrower</em> proposition than the plurality, for whatever reason, is willing to accept.  Namely, many of the Framers understood the word \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d in the Establishment Clause to encompass only the various sects of Christianity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence is compelling.  Prior to the Philadelphia Convention, the States had begun to protect \xe2\x80\x9creligious freedom\xe2\x80\x9d in their various constitutions.  Many of those provisions, however, restricted \xe2\x80\x9cequal protection\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfree exercise\xe2\x80\x9d to Christians, and invocations of the divine were commonly understood to refer to Christ.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  That historical background likely informed the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of the First Amendment.  Accordingly, one influential thinker wrote of the First Amendment that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cestablishment\xe2\x80\x9d in this amendment unquestionably is, the preference and establishment given by law to one sect of Christians over every other.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Jasper Adams, The Relation of Christianity to Civil Government in the United States (Feb. 13, 1833) (quoted in Dreisbach 16).  That definition tracked the understanding of the text Justice Story adopted in his famous Commentaries, in which he wrote that the \xe2\x80\x9creal object\xe2\x80\x9d of the Clause was:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cnot to countenance, much less to advance Mahometanism, or Judaism, or infidelity, by prostrating Christianity; but to exclude all rivalry among Christian sects, and to prevent any national ecclesiastical establishment, which should give to an hierarchy the exclusive patronage of the national government.  It thus sought to cut off the means of religious persecution, (the vice and pest of former ages,) and the power of subverting the rights of conscience in matters of religion, which had been trampled upon almost from the days of the Apostles to the present age.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa7991, p. 701 (R. Rotunda &amp; J. Nowak eds. 1987) (hereinafter Story); see also <em>Wallace</em>, 472 U. S., at 52\xe2\x80\x9355, and n. 36.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nAlong these lines, for nearly a century after the Founding, many accepted the idea that America was not just a <em>religious </em>nation, but \xe2\x80\x9ca Christian nation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Church of Holy Trinity</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/143/457/index.html"></a><a href="/us/143/457/index.html">143 U. S. 457</a>, 471 (1892).[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The original understanding of the type of \xe2\x80\x9creligion\xe2\x80\x9d that qualified for constitutional protection under the Establishment Clause likely did not include those followers of Judaism and Islam who are among the preferred \xe2\x80\x9cmonotheistic\xe2\x80\x9d religions Justice Scalia has embraced in his <em>McCreary County </em>opinion.  See <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (dissenting opinion).[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  The inclusion of Jews and Muslims inside the category of constitutionally favored religions surely would have shocked Chief Justice Marshall and Justice Story.  Indeed, Justice Scalia is unable to point to any persuasive historical evidence or entrenched traditions in support of his decision to give specially preferred constitutional status to all monotheistic religions.  Perhaps this is because the history of the Establishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99s original meaning just as strongly supports a preference for Christianity as it does a preference for monotheism.  Generic references to \xe2\x80\x9cGod\xe2\x80\x9d hardly constitute evidence that those who spoke the word meant to be inclusive of all monotheistic believers; nor do such references demonstrate that those who heard the word spoken understood it broadly to include all monotheistic faiths.  See <em>supra</em>, at 21.  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of Judaism and Islam is a laudable act of religious tolerance, but it is one that is unmoored from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s history and text, and moreover one that is patently arbitrary in its inclusion of some, but exclusion of other (<em>e.g.</em>, Buddhism), widely practiced non-Christian religions.  See <em>supra</em>, at 12, 13\xe2\x80\x9314, and n. 16 (noting that followers of Buddhism nearly equal the number of Americans who follow Islam).  Given the original understanding of the men who championed our \xe2\x80\x9cChristian nation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94men who had no cause to view anti-Semitism or contempt for atheists as problems worthy of civic concern\xe2\x80\x94one must ask whether Justice Scalia \xe2\x80\x9chas not had the courage (or the foolhardiness) to apply [his originalism] principle consistently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCreary County, post</em>, at 7.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, to constrict narrowly the reach of the Establishment Clause to the views of the Founders would lead to more than this unpalatable result; it would also leave us with an unincorporated constitutional provision\xe2\x80\x94in other words, one that limits only the <em>federal </em>establishment of \xe2\x80\x9ca national religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Elk Grove Unified School Dist.</em> v. <em>Newdow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/1/index.html">542 U. S. 1</a>, 45 (2004) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment); cf. A. Amar, The Bill of Rights 36\xe2\x80\x9339 (1998).  Under this view, not only could a State constitutionally adorn all of its public spaces with crucifixes or passages from the New Testament, it would also have full authority to prescribe the teachings of Martin Luther or Joseph Smith as <em>the</em> official state religion.  Only the Federal Government would be prohibited from taking sides, (and only then as between Christian sects).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A reading of the First Amendment dependent on either of the purported original meanings expressed above would eviscerate the heart of the Establishment Clause.  It would replace Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwall of separation\xe2\x80\x9d with a perverse wall of exclusion\xe2\x80\x94Christians inside, non-Christians out.  It would permit States to construct walls of their own choosing\xe2\x80\x94Baptists inside, Mormons out; Jewish Orthodox inside, Jewish Reform out.  A Clause so understood might be faithful to the expectations of some of our Founders, but it is plainly not worthy of a society whose enviable hallmark over the course of two centuries has been the continuing expansion of religious pluralism and tolerance.  Cf. <em>Abington</em>, 374 U. S., at 214; <em>Zelman</em> v. <em>Simmons-Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/639/index.html">536 U.

S. 296</a>, 303 (1940), appeals to the religiosity of the Framers ring hollow.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  But even if there were a coherent way to embrace incorporation with one hand while steadfastly abiding by the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 purported religious views on the other, the problem of the selective use of history remains.  As the widely divergent views espoused by the leaders of our founding era plainly reveal, the historical record of the preincorporation Establishment Clause is too indeterminate to serve as an interpretive North Star.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is our duty, therefore, to interpret the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s command that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\xe2\x80\x9d not by merely asking what those words meant to observers at the time of the founding, but instead by deriving from the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s text and history the broad principles that remain valid today.  As we have said in the context of statutory interpretation, legislation \xe2\x80\x9coften [goes] beyond the principal evil [at which the statute was aimed] to cover reasonably comparable evils, and it is ultimately the provisions of our laws rather than the principal concerns of our legislators by which we are governed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Oncale</em> v. <em>Sundowner Offshore Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/75/index.html">523 U.

In similar fashion, we have construed the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to prohibit segregated schools, see <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/294/index.html">349 U.

S. 677</a> (1973), despite the fact that the contemporaries of the Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt[ed] very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Slaughter-House Cases,</em> 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873).  And we have construed \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards of decency\xe2\x80\x9d to make impermissible practices that were not considered \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual\xe2\x80\x9d at the founding.  See <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, 543 U.

The task of applying the broad principles that the Framers wrote into the text of the First Amendment is, in any event, no more a matter of personal preference than is one\xe2\x80\x99s selection between two (or more) sides in a heated historical debate.  We serve our constitutional mandate by expounding the meaning of constitutional provisions with one eye towards our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and the other fixed on its democratic aspirations.  See <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland,</em> 4 Wheat. 316, 407, 415 (1819) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must never forget, that it is <em>a constitution</em> we are expounding\xe2\x80\x9d that is intended to \xe2\x80\x9cendure for ages to come, and, consequently, to be adapted to the various <em>crises</em> of human affairs\xe2\x80\x9d).  Constitutions, after all,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9care not ephemeral enactments, designed to meet passing occasions.  They are, to use the words of Chief Justice Marshall, \xe2\x80\x98designed to approach immortality as nearly as human institutions can approach it.\xe2\x80\x99  The future is their care and provision for events of good and bad tendencies of which no prophecy can be made.  In the application of a constitution, therefore, our contemplation cannot be only of what has been but of what may be.  Under any other rule a constitution would indeed be as easy of application as it would be deficient in efficacy and power.  Its general principles would have little value and be converted by precedent into impotent and lifeless formulas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weems</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/index.html">217 U. S. 349</a>, 373 (1910).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principle that guides my analysis is neutrality.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  The basis for that principle is firmly rooted in our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and our Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text.  I recognize that the requirement that government must remain neutral between religion and irreligion would have seemed foreign to some of the Framers; so too would a requirement of neutrality between Jews and Christians.  But cf. Letter from George Washington to the Hebrew Congregation in Newport, R.\xc2\xa0I. (Aug. 18, 1790), in 6 Papers of George Washington 284, 285 (D. Twohig ed. 1996).  Fortunately, we are not bound by the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 expectations\xe2\x80\x94we are bound by the legal principles they enshrined in our Constitution.  Story\xe2\x80\x99s vision that States should not discriminate between Christian sects has as its foundation the principle that government must remain neutral between valid systems of belief.  As religious pluralism has expanded, so has our acceptance of what constitutes valid belief systems.  The evil of discriminating today against atheists, \xe2\x80\x9cpolytheists[,] and believers in unconcerned deities,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McCreary County</em>, <em>post</em>, at 10 (Scalia, J., dissenting), is in my view a direct descendent of the evil of discriminating among Christian sects.  The Establishment Clause thus forbids it and, in turn, forbids Texas from displaying the Ten Commandments monument the plurality so casually affirms.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eagles may donate as many monuments as they choose to be displayed in front of Protestant churches, benevolent organizations\xe2\x80\x99 meeting places, or on the front lawns of private citizens.  The expurgated text of the King James version of the Ten Commandments that they have crafted is unlikely to be accepted by Catholic parishes, Jewish synagogues, or even some Protestant denominations, but the message they seek to convey is surely more compatible with church property than with property that is located on the government side of the metaphorical wall.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court in this case stands for the proposition that the Constitution permits governmental displays of sacred religious texts.  This makes a mockery of the constitutional ideal that government must remain neutral between religion and irreligion.  If a State may endorse a particular deity\xe2\x80\x99s command to \xe2\x80\x9chave no other gods before me,\xe2\x80\x9d it is difficult to conceive of any textual display that would run afoul of the Establishment Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The disconnect between this Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval of Texas\xe2\x80\x99s monument and the constitutional prohibition against preferring religion to irreligion cannot be reduced to the exercise of plotting two adjacent locations on a slippery slope.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 8 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  Rather, it is the difference between the shelter of a fortress and exposure to \xe2\x80\x9cthe winds that would blow\xe2\x80\x9d if the wall were allowed to crumble.

See <em>McCreary County</em>, <em>post</em>, at 13 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  To adopt such an interpretive approach would misguidedly give authoritative weight to the fact that the Congress that passed the Fourteenth Amendment also enacted laws that tolerated segregation, and the fact that the Congress that passed the First Amendment also enacted laws, such as the Alien and Sedition Act, that indisputably violated our present understanding of the First Amendment.

There is no evidence, for example, that incorporation of the Confrontation Clause ran contrary to the core of the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s original understanding.  There is, however, some persuasive evidence to this effect regarding the Establishment Clause.

In my view, although actual religious coercion is undoubtedly forbidden by the Establishment Clause, that cannot be the full extent of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwall\xe2\x80\x9d metaphor and his refusal to issue Thanksgiving proclamations, see <em>supra, </em>at 19, would have been nonsensical if the Clause reached only direct coercion.  Further, under the \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d view, the Establishment Clause would amount to little more than a replica of our compelled speech doctrine, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>West Virginia Bd. of Ed.</em> v. <em>Barnette</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/index.html">319 U. S. 624</a>, 639 (1943), with a religious flavor.  A Clause so interpreted would not prohibit explicit state endorsements of religious orthodoxies of particular sects, actions that lie at the heart of what the Clause was meant to regulate.  The government could, for example, take out television advertisements lauding Catholicism as the only pure religion.  Under the reasoning endorsed by Justice Thomas, those programs would not be coercive because the viewer could simply turn off the television or ignore the ad.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mere presence of the monument \xe2\x80\xa6 involves no coercion\xe2\x80\x9d because the passerby \xe2\x80\x9cneed not stop to read it or even to look at it\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further, the notion that the application of a \xe2\x80\x9ccoercion\xe2\x80\x9d principle would somehow lead to a more consistent jurisprudence is dubious.  Enshrining coercion as the Establishment Clause touchstone fails to eliminate the difficult judgment calls regarding \xe2\x80\x9cthe form that coercion must take.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCreary County</em>, <em>post</em>, at 25 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Coercion may seem obvious to some, while appearing nonexistent to others.  Compare <em>Santa\xc2\xa0Fe Independent School Dist.</em>, 530 U. S., at 312, with <em>Lee</em>, 505 U. S., at 642 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  It may be a legal requirement or an effect that is indirectly inferred from a variety of factors.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Engel</em> v. <em>Vitale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/421/index.html"></a><a href="/us/370/421/index.html">370 U. S. 421</a>, 431 (1962) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, \xe2\x80\x9creasonable people could, and no doubt would, argue about whether coercion existed in a particular situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Feldman, The Intellectual Origins of the Establishment Clause, 77 N.\xc2\xa0Y.
