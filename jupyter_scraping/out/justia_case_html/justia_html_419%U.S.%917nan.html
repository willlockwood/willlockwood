The witness, one Perry Scheer, had been a principal in a collapsed brokerage house whose activities were under investigation by the SEC and the FBI; there was strong evidence that Scheer had been involved in at least seven illegal securities transactions. Petitioner, who was allegedly in league with various persons who could have been harmed by Scheer\'s testimony before a grand jury investigating the affairs of the brokerage house, met with Scheer on several occasions and sought to secure Scheer\'s silence through veiled threats and suggestions that Scheer \'take the Fifth\' (or, in more contemporary parlance, \'stonewall it\'). Unbeknownst to petitioner, Scheer by this time was cooperating fully with federal authorities, and had been fitted out with a recording device on which he recorded several of his conversations with petitioner; these recordings were introduced at trial to corroborate and supplement Scheer\'s own testimony, and were played several times for the jury.

See, e. g., Lewis v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/385/206/case.html">385 U.S. 206</a>, 344-347 ( Douglas, J., dissenting); Hoffa v.

Ed.2d 394, the Court upheld the use of a recording of a face-to-face conversation where there had been prior dudicial authorization for the recording. Id., at 329-330. In my dissent from Osborn and elsewhere, I have set forth my view that even prior judicial approval cannot validate intrusions into constitutionally protected zones of privacy for the seizure of mere evidentiary material; the need for this protection is particularly acute when the items to be seized are an individual\'s own words, thoughts, papers and personal effects, even if no Fifth Amendment problem is squarely presented. Id., at 349-354 (Douglas, J., dissenting); Warden v. Hayden, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/294/case.html">387 U.S. 294</a>, 319-325 (Douglas, J., dissenting); Couch v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#343">409 U.S. 322, 343</a> (Douglas, J., dissenting). In light of the absence of any attempt to secure judicial authorization in the present case, I see no need to press that view further at this time. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> See, e. g., Osborn v.
