The word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d usually connotes a requirement, unlike the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d which implies discretion.  Compare <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26\n, with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rodgers</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677\n.  The use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b) and (c) confirms this reading; for when a statute distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshall,\xe2\x80\x9d the latter generally imposes a mandatory duty.

First, \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s prefatory clause, which declares that the Rule of Two is designed \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d meeting \xc2\xa78127(a)\xe2\x80\x99s annual contracting goals, has no bearing on whether \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement is mandatory or discretionary.  The prefatory clause\xe2\x80\x99s announcement of an objective does not change the operative clause\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning.  See <i>Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley R.

Second, an FSS order is a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d within the ordinary meaning of that term; thus, FSS orders do not fall outside \xc2\xa78127(d), which applies when the Department \xe2\x80\x9caward[s] contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Third, to say that the Rule of Two will hamper mundane Government purchases misapprehends current FSS practices, which have expanded well beyond simple procurement to, as in this case, contracts concerning complex information technology services over a multiyear period.  Finally, because the mandate \xc2\xa78127(d) imposes is unambiguous, this Court declines the invitation to defer to the Department\xe2\x80\x99s declaration that \xc2\xa78127 procedures are inapplicable to FSS orders.

The Small Business Act thus requires many federal agencies, including the Department of Veterans Affairs, to set aside contracts to be awarded to small businesses.  The Act requires each agency to set \xe2\x80\x9can annual goal that presents, for that agency, the maximum practicable opportunity\xe2\x80\x9d for contracting with small businesses, including those \xe2\x80\x9csmall business concerns owned and controlled by service-disabled veterans.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7644(g)(1)(B).

The Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cRule of Two,\xe2\x80\x9d at issue here, provides that the Department \xe2\x80\x9cshall award\xe2\x80\x9d contracts by restricting competition for the contract to service-disabled or other veteran-owned small businesses.  To restrict competition under the Act, the contracting officer must reasonably expect that at least two of these businesses will submit offers and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe award can be made at a fair and reasonable price that offers best value to the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa78127(d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress provided two exceptions to the Rule.

Around January 2012, the Department decided to procure an Emergency Notification Service for four medical centers.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  In an emergency, this service sends important information to Department personnel.  The Department sent a request for a price quotation to a non-veteran-owned company through the FSS system.  That company responded with a favorable price, which the Department accepted around February 22, 2012.  The agreement was for one year, with an option to extend the agreement for two more.  The Department exercised the one option to extend the time, and performance was completed in May 2013.

Kingdomware alleged that the Department procured multiple contracts through the FSS without restricting competition using the Rule of Two, as required by \xc2\xa78127.  Kingdomware contended that the Department could not award the contracts at issue here without first checking to see whether at least two veteran-owned small businesses could perform the work at a fair and reasonable price.  The GAO issued a nonbinding determination that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s failure to employ the Rule of Two was unlawful and recommended that the Department conduct market research to determine whether there were two veteran-owned businesses that could fulfill the procurement.

When Kingdomware filed this suit four years ago, it sought a permanent injunction and declara-tory relief with respect to a particular procurement.

See Decl. of Corydon Ford Heard III \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb66\xe2\x80\x938.  As a result, no court can enjoin further performance of those services or solicit new bids for the performance of those services.  And declaratory relief would have no effect here with respect to the present procurements because the services have already been rendered.</b></p><b>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although a case would generally be moot in such circumstances, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents recognize an exception to the mootness doctrine for a controversy that is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Spencer</i> v. <i>Kemna</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n17 (1998)\n.

First, the procurements were fully performed in less than two years after they were awarded.  We have previously held that a period of two years is too short to complete judicial review of the lawfulness of the procurement.  See <i>Southern Pacific Terminal Co.</i> v. <i>ICC</i>,\n\n219 U.\xc2\xa0S. 498\n\xe2\x80\x93516 (1911).  Second, it is reasonable to expect that the Department will refuse to apply the Rule of Two in a future procurement for the kind of services provided by Kingdomware.  If Kingdomware\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa78127(d) is correct, then the Department must use restricted competition rather than procure on the open market.  And Kingdomware, which has been awarded many previous contracts, has shown a reasonable likelihood that it would be awarded a future contract if its interpretation of \xc2\xa78127(d) prevails.  See Decl. of Corydon Ford Heard III \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb611\xe2\x80\x9315 (explaining that the company continues to bid on similar contracts).  Thus, we have jurisdiction because the same legal issue in this case is likely to recur in future controversies between the same parties in circumstances where the period of contract performance is too short to allow full judicial review before performance is complete.  Our interpretation of \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements in this case will govern the Department\xe2\x80\x99s future contracting.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">On the merits, we hold that \xc2\xa78127 is mandatory, not discretionary.  Its text requires the Department to apply the Rule of Two to all contracting determinations and to award contracts to veteran-owned small businesses.  The Act does not allow the Department to evade the Rule of Two on the ground that it has already met its contracting goals or on the ground that the Department has placed an order through the FSS.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In statutory construction, we begin \xe2\x80\x9cwith the language of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barnhart </i>v. <i>Sigmon Coal Co.</i>,\n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n450 (2002)\n.

Section 8127(d) requires that \xe2\x80\x9ca contracting officer of the Department <i>shall</i> award contracts\xe2\x80\x9d to veteran-owned small businesses using restricted competition whenever the Rule of Two is satisfied, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as provided in subsections (b) and (c).\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  Subsections (b) and (c) provide, in turn, that the Department \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d use noncompetitive procedures and sole-source contracts for lower value acquisitions.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b), (c).  Except when the Department uses the noncompetitive and sole-source contracting procedures in subsections (b) and (c), \xc2\xa78127(d) requires the Department to use the Rule of Two before awarding a contract to another supplier.

Unlike the word \xe2\x80\x9cmay,\xe2\x80\x9d which implies discretion, the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d usually connotes a requirement.  Compare <i>Lexecon Inc.</i> v. <i>Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes &amp; Lerach</i>,\n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 26,\n35 (1998)\n<i> </i>(recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnormally creates an obligation<i> </i>impervious to judicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Rodgers</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677,\n706 (1983)\n (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he word \xe2\x80\x98may,\xe2\x80\x99 when used in a statute, usually implies some degree of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Accordingly, the Department <i>shall </i>(or <i>must</i>) prefer veteran-owned small businesses when the Rule of Two is satisfied.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The surrounding subsections of \xc2\xa78127 confirm that Congress used the word \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa78127(d) as a command.  Like \xc2\xa78127(d), both \xc2\xa78127(b) and \xc2\xa78127(c) provide special procedures \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of meeting the goals under [\xc2\xa78127(a)].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b), (c).  But, in contrast to \xc2\xa78127(d), those latter two provisions state that \xe2\x80\x9ca contracting officer of the Department <i>may</i> use\xe2\x80\x9d (or, for \xc2\xa78127(c), \xe2\x80\x9c<i>may</i> award\xe2\x80\x9d) such contracts.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b), (c) (emphasis added).  When a statute distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshall,\xe2\x80\x9d it is generally clear that \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d imposes a mandatory duty.  See <i>United States ex rel. Siegel</i> v. <i>Thoman</i>,\n\n156 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353\n\xe2\x80\x93360 (1895).  We see no reason to depart from the usual inference here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore hold that, before contracting with a non-veteran owned business, the Department must first apply the Rule of Two.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Federal Circuit and the Department offered several reasons for their alternative reading of \xc2\xa78127(d) as a discretionary provision that the Department can disregard for at least some contracting decisions.  We disagree with them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To hold that \xc2\xa78127(d) is discretionary, the Federal Circuit relied on \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s prefatory clause.  754 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 933.  That clause declares that the Rule of Two is designed \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purposes of\xe2\x80\x9d meeting the annual contracting goals that the Department is required to set under \xc2\xa78127(a).  The Department originally made a similar argument before changing arguments in its briefing on the merits.  Compare Brief in Opposition 13\xe2\x80\x9315 with Brief for United States 24\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the prefatory clause has no bearing on whether \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement is mandatory or discretionary.  The clause announces an objective that Congress hoped that the Department would achieve and charges the Secretary with setting annual benchmarks, but it does not change the plain meaning of the operative clause, \xc2\xa78127(d).  See <i>Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley R. Co.</i> v. <i>Thomas</i>,\n\n132 U.\xc2\xa0S. 174,\n188 (1889)\n (explaining that prefatory clauses or preambles cannot change the scope of the operative clause).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation also would produce an anomaly.  If the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of \xc2\xa78127(d)\xe2\x80\x99s prefatory clause were correct, then \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b) and (c), which also contain \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of meeting the goals\xe2\x80\x9d clauses, would cease to apply once the Department meets the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s goal, and the Department would be required to return to competitive bidding.  If we interpreted the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes\xe2\x80\x9d clause of \xc2\xa78127(d) to mean that its mandate no longer applies if the goals are met, then the identical \xe2\x80\x9cpurposes\xe2\x80\x9d clauses of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b) and (c) would also render those clauses\xe2\x80\x99 permissive mandates inapplic-able.  This would require the Department, once the goals are met, to award bids using the default contracting procedures rather than to use the noncompetitive and single-source provisions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78127(b) and (c).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Department argues that the mandatory provision does not apply to \xe2\x80\x9corders\xe2\x80\x9d under \xe2\x80\x9cpre-existing FSS contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 25.  The Department failed to raise this argument in the courts below, and we normally decline to entertain such forfeited arguments.  See <i>OBB Personenverkehr AG</i> v. <i>Sachs</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 10).  But the Department\xe2\x80\x99s forfeited argument fails in any event.  Section 8127(d) applies when the Department \xe2\x80\x9caward[s] contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  When the Department places an FSS order, that order creates contractual obligations for each party and is a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d within the ordinary meaning of that term.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 389 (10th ed. 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]n agreement between two or more parties creating obligations that are enforce-able or otherwise recognizable at law\xe2\x80\x9d).  It also creates a \xe2\x80\x9ccontract\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by federal regulations, namely, a \xe2\x80\x9cmutually binding legal relationship obligating the seller to furnish the supplies or services .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the buyer to pay for them,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9call types of commitments that obligate the Government to an expenditure of appropriated funds and\xe2\x80\x9d (as a general matter) \xe2\x80\x9care in writing.\xe2\x80\x9d  48 CFR \xc2\xa72.101 (2015).  An FSS order creates mutually binding obligations: for the contractor, to supply certain goods or services, and for the Government, to pay.  The placement of the order creates a new contract; the underlying FSS contract gives the Government the option to buy, but it does not require the Government to make a purchase or expend funds.  Further confirming that FSS orders are contracts, the Government is not completely bound by the FSS contract\xe2\x80\x99s terms; to the contrary, when placing orders, agencies may sometimes seek different terms than are listed in the FSS.  See \xc2\xa78.405\xe2\x80\x934 (permitting agencies to negotiate some new terms, such as requesting \xe2\x80\x9ca price reduction,\xe2\x80\x9d when ordering from the FSS).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the Department contends that our interpretation fails to appreciate the distinction between FSS orders and contracts.  The Department maintains that FSS orders are only for simplified acquisitions, and that using the Rule of Two for these purchases will hamper mundane purchases like \xe2\x80\x9cgriddles or food slicers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 21.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this argument understates current practices under the FSS.  The Department has expanded use of the FSS well beyond simple procurement.  See Brief for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>14\xe2\x80\x9316.  This case proves the point: the contract at issue here concerned complex information technology services over a multiyear period.  Moreover, the Department may con-tinue to purchase items that cost less than the simplified acquisition threshold (currently $150,000) through the FSS, if the Department procures them from a veteran-owned small business.  See\n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa78127(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally and relatedly, the Department asks us to defer to its interpretation that FSS \xe2\x80\x9corders\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9ccontracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n467 U.\xc2\xa0S. 837\n\xe2\x80\x93844 (1984) (establishing deference to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of an ambiguous statute).  Even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the preamble to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s rulemaking could be owed <i>Chevron </i>deference, we do not defer to the agency when the statute is unambiguous.  See <i>id., </i>at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  For the reasons already given, the text of \xc2\xa78127(d) clearly imposes a mandatory duty.  Thus, we decline the Department\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to defer to its interpretation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We hold that the Rule of Two contracting procedures in \xc2\xa78127(d) are not limited to those contracts necessary to fulfill the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s goals under \xc2\xa78127(a).  We also hold that \xc2\xa78127(d) applies to orders placed under the FSS.
