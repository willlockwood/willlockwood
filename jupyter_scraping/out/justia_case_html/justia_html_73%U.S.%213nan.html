JUSTICE FIELD, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court, as follows:</p>\n<p>There is no doubt, as stated by the counsel for the appellant, that the jurisdiction of the admiralty extends to all cases of tort committed on the high seas, and in this country on navigable waters.  For the redress of these torts, the courts of admiralty may proceed <em>in personam,</em> and when the cause of the injury is the subject of a maritime lien, may also proceed <em>in rem.</em>  The latter proceeding is the remedy afforded for the enforcement of liens of that character.</p>\n<p>A maritime lien, unlike a lien at common law, may in many cases exist without possession of the thing, upon which it is asserted, either actual or constructive.  It confers, however, upon its holder such a right in the thing that he may subject it to condemnation and sale to satisfy his claim or damages, and when the lien arises from torts committed at sea, it travels with the thing wherever that goes and into whosesoever hands it may pass.  The only object of the proceeding <em>in rem</em> is to make this right, where it exists, available -- to carry it into effect.  It subserves no other purpose.</p>\n<p>The lien and the proceeding <em>in rem</em> are therefore correlative -- where one exists, the other can be taken, and not otherwise.  Such is the language of the Privy Council in the decision of the case of <em>The Bold Buccleugh.</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  "A maritime lien," says that court,</p>\n<p>"is the foundation of the proceeding <em>in rem,</em> a process to make perfect a right inchoate from the moment the lien attaches, and whilst it must be admitted that where such lien exists, a proceeding <em>in rem</em> may be had, it will be found to be equally true that in all cases where a proceeding <em>in rem</em> is the proper course, there a maritime lien exists which gives a privilege or claim upon the thing to be carried into effect by legal process."</p>\n<p>There is an expression in the case of <em>The Volant,</em> [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] attributed to Dr. Lushington, which militates against this view.  He is reported to have said that the damage committed on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 73 U. S. 216</a></p><p> the high seas confers no lien upon the ship, and this is cited by the counsel of the appellant to show that a maritime lien is not the foundation of a proceeding <em>in rem.</em>  But the expression is a mere dictum, and the Privy Council in the case cited allude to it and observe that it is doubtful, from a contemporaneous report of the same case, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] whether the learned judge made use of it, and add that if he did, the expression is certainly inaccurate, and, not being necessary for the decision of the case cannot be taken as authority.</p>\n<p>A maritime lien can only exist upon movable things engaged in navigation or upon things which are the subjects of commerce on the high seas or navigable waters.  It may arise with reference to vessels, steamers, and rafts, and upon goods and merchandise carried by them.  But it cannot arise upon anything which is fixed and immovable like a wharf, a bridge, or real estate of any kind.  Though bridges and wharves may aid commerce by facilitating intercourse on land or the discharge of cargoes, they are not in any sense the subjects of maritime lien.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>7 Moore 284.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>1 W.
