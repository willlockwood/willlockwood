S. 368</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A motion has been made to dismiss the writ of error upon the ground that there is nothing apparent upon the record which brings the case within the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, under the 25th section of the Judiciary Act of 1789.  It is conceded on all sides that this is entirely correct unless the report of the judge who tried the cause, which contains a statement of the facts, is to be considered as a part of the record.  And we are unanimously of opinion that it cannot be so considered.  It is not like a special verdict or a statement of facts agreed of record, upon which the court is to pronounce its judgment.  The judgment is rendered upon a general verdict, and the report is mere matter <em>in pais,</em> to regulate the discretion of the court as to the propriety of granting relief, or sustaining a motion for a new trial.</p>\n<p>The writ of error must therefore be</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
