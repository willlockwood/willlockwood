Application of these principles in Pinkerton and Darden was difficult, given my view that the petitions in those cases were meritless. This case plainly presents weaker grounds for affirming the decision reached below. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p></p><h3><p> II </p></h3> <p> The second point which the dissent raises requires less discussion. The dissent appears to conclude that it is inappropriate, in cases such as this one, to vacate a stay prior to the filing of the petition for certiorari. This position would render the grant of a stay effectively unreviewable in capital cases. The role of a stay in such cases is to delay the execution while the petition for certiorari is prepared and filed. If a stay, once entered, must necessarily remain in place until it has accomplished its purpose, then review of decisions to grant stays is senseless. This Court has never suggested that the discretion to grant or deny stays in capital cases (or any other class of cases) is total. </p><p> Finally, it bears emphasizing that the State has a legitimate interest in carrying out its lawfully imposed sentences. Respondent was sentenced to death for a particularly brutal murder in 1978. His conviction and sentence have thrice been reviewed by the Florida Supreme Court. Booker v. State, 441 So.2d 148 (1983); Booker v. State, 413 So.2d 756 (1982); Booker v. State, 397 So.2d 910, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 957 (1981). He has filed two petitions for habeas corpus in federal court; both have been denied. Booker v. Wainwright, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/764/1371/">764 F.2d 1371</a> (CAll 1985); Booker v. Wainwright, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/703/1241/">703 F.2d 1241</a> (CAll), rehearing denied, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/708/734/">708 F.2d 734</a>, cert. denied, 464 U.S. 922 (1983). This Court has twice denied certiorari. Booker v. Wainwright, 464 U.S. 922 (1983); Booker v. Florida, 454 U.S. 957 (1981). None of the many opinions that have been filed in this protracted litigation suggests that respondent is innocent or that his conviction raises any serious constitutional issues. For our system of justice to function effectively, litigation in cases such as this one must cease when there is no reasonable ground for questioning either the guilt of the defendant or the constitutional sufficiency of the procedures employed to convict and sentence him. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="938">Page 473 U.S. 935 , 938</a></p><p> </p><p> Justice MARSHALL, with whom Justice BRENNAN joins, dissenting from the grant of application to vacate stay of execution. </p><p> Today the Court vacates a stay pending certiorari granted by the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, although we have not even received the petition for certiorari. In so doing, the Court ignores repeated reminders by Justices of the Court that our power to vacate a stay entered by a lower court should be reserved only for exceptional circumstances, see, e.g., Kemp v. Smith, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1321/case.html">463 U.S. 1321</a>, 77 L. Ed.2d 1424 (1983) (POWELL, J., Circuit Justice); O\'Connor v. Board of Education, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/1301/case.html">449 U.S. 1301</a> (1980) (STEVENS, J., Circuit Justice), and that the lower court\'s decision is "deserving of great weight," Commodity Futures Trading Commission v. British American Commodity Options Corp., <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/1316/case.html#1319">434 U.S. 1316, 1319</a>, 12 (1977) (MARSHALL, J., Circuit Justice). </p><p> Although the state\'s brief motion fails even to suggest that it has met this heavy burden, the Court has moved "with an impetuousness and arrogance that is truly astonishing," Wainwright v. Adams, 466 U.S. 964, 966, 2185 (1984) (MARSHALL, J., dissenting from the grant of application to vacate stay of execution). The apparent basis for the state\'s motion is a concern that the Court of Appeals understood our recent decisions in Pinkerton v. McCotter, 473 U.S. 925 (1985), and Darden v. Wainwright, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/928/case.html">473 U.S. 928</a> (1985), to mandate the grant of a stay in this case. However, this Court has provided detailed guidance to the courts of appeals as to stays in capital cases, see Barefoot v. Estelle, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/880/case.html">463 U.S. 880</a>, 887-896, 3391-3396 (1983). There is no reason for us to assume, on the meager record before us, that the Court of Appeals was unaware of, or misapplied, those standards-let alone that it committed the gross abuse of discretion necessary to support a grant of this motion, see Wainwright v. Adams, supra, 473 U.S. at 965, 104 S.Ct. at 2184. I am therefore at a loss to understand the Court\'s unwillingness to let matters run their ordinary course. </p><p> I dissent. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] This opinion was filed September 24, 1985. </p><p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> The third requirement-that irreparable harm will result if a stay is not granted-is necessarily present in capital cases. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Darden v. Wainwright, 473 U.S., at 926, 106 S.Ct., at ---(POWELL, J., concurring); Pinkerton v.
