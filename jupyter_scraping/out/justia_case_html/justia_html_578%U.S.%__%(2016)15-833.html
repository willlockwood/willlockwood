If the state courts adjudicate the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s federal claim \xe2\x80\x9con the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d), then AEDPA mandates deferential, rather than <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>, review, prohibiting federal courts from granting habeas relief unless the state-court decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  The Ninth Circuit in this case decided that the Supreme Court of California\xe2\x80\x99s summary denial of a habeas petition was <i>not</i> \xe2\x80\x9con the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential-review provisions did not apply.  We summarily reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent Antonio Hinojosa was serving a 16-year sentence for armed robbery and related crimes when,in 2009, California prison officials \xe2\x80\x9cvalidated\xe2\x80\x9d him as a prison-gang associate and placed him in a secured housing unit.  At the time of Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s offense and conviction, California law had permitted prisoners placed in a secured housing unit solely by virtue of their prison-gang affiliations to continue to accrue good-time credits.  See Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa72933.6 (West 2000).  In 2010, the California Legislature amended the law so that prison-gang associates placed in a secured housing unit could no longer earn future good-time credits, although they would retain any credits already earned.  \xc2\xa72933.6(a) (West Supp. 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hinojosa filed a state habeas petition, arguing (as relevant here) that applying the new law to him violated the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of <i>ex post facto</i> laws.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa710, cl.\xc2\xa01; <i>Weaver</i> v. <i>Graham</i>,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 24 (1981)\n.  The Orange County Superior Court denied the claim \xe2\x80\x9con grounds petitioner has not sought review of his claim of error in the proper judicial venue.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 44a.  The court explained:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Although any superior court has jurisdiction to entertain and adjudicate a petition for writ of habeas corpus, it does not follow that it should do so in all instances.\xe2\x80\x99  Challenges to conditions of an inmate\xe2\x80\x99s confinement should be entertained by the superior court of county wherein the inmate is confined.  (<i>Griggs v. Superior Court</i> (1976) 16 Cal.\xc2\xa03d 341, 347.)</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9cThe petition for writ of habeas corpus is DENIED.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 44a\xe2\x80\x9345a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather than file a new petition in the correct venue (Kings County Superior Court), Hinojosa turned to the appellate court, which summarily denied his petition.  Instead of appealing that denial, see Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71506 (West Supp. 2016), Hinojosa sought an original writ of habeas corpus in the Supreme Court of California, see Cal. Const., Art. 6, \xc2\xa710, which summarily denied relief without explanation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A petition for federal habeas relief followed.  Adopting the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings and recommendation, the District Court denied Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s <i>ex post facto</i> claim under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential review.  A Ninth Circuit panel reversed.  <i>Hinojosa</i> v. <i>Davey</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 412 (2015).  Citing our decision in <i>Ylst</i> v. <i>Nunnemaker</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 797 (1991)\n, the panel \xe2\x80\x9clooked through\xe2\x80\x9d the Supreme Court of California\xe2\x80\x99s summary denial to the last reasoned decision adjudicating Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s claim: the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal for improper venue.  The panel reasoned that the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cis not a determination \xe2\x80\x98on the merits\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that as a result it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot bound by AEDPA.\xe2\x80\x9d  803 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 419.  Having thus freed itself from AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s strictures, the court granted Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s petition for habeas relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reverse.  In <i>Ylst</i>, we said that where \xe2\x80\x9cthe last reasoned opinion on the claim explicitly imposes a procedural default, we will presume that a later decision rejecting the claim did not silently disregard that bar and consider the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 803.  We adopted this presumption because \xe2\x80\x9csilence implies consent, not the opposite\xe2\x80\x94and courts generally behave accordingly, affirming without further discussion when they agree, not when they disagree, with the reasons given below.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 804.  But we pointedly refused to make the presumption irrebuttable; \xe2\x80\x9cstrong evidence can refute it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is amply refuted here.  Improper venue could not possibly have been a ground for the high court\xe2\x80\x99s summary denial of Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  There is only one Supreme Court of California\xe2\x80\x94and thus only one venue in which Hinojosa could have sought an original writ of habeas corpus in that court.  Under these circumstances, it cannot be that the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial \xe2\x80\x9crest[ed] upon the same ground\xe2\x80\x9d as the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  <i>Id.,</i> at 803.  It quite obviously rested upon some different ground.  <i>Ylst</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clook-through\xe2\x80\x9d approach is therefore inapplicable.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Hinojosa resists this conclusion, remarking that \xe2\x80\x9ca reviewing court has discretion to deny <i>without prejudice</i> a habeas corpus petition that was not filed first in a proper lower court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Steele</i>, 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P.\xc2\xa03d 444, 449 (2004) (emphasis added).  But there is no indication that the summary denial here was without prejudice, thus refuting Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s speculation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Containing no statement to the contrary, the Supreme Court of California\xe2\x80\x99s summary denial of Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s petition was therefore on the merits.  <i>Harrington</i> v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86,\n99 (2011)\n.  Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit should have reviewed Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s <i>ex post facto</i> claim through AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential lens.  And although we express no view on the merits of that claim, we note that the Ninth Circuit has already held that state-court denials of claims identical to Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s are not contrary to clearly established federal law.  See <i>Nevarez</i> v. <i>Barnes</i>, 749 F.\xc2\xa03d 1124 (CA9 2014); see also <i>In\xc2\xa0re Efstathiou</i>, 200 Cal. App. 4th 725, 730\xe2\x80\x93732, 133 Cal. Rptr. 3d 34, 37\xe2\x80\x9340 (2011); <i>In\xc2\xa0re Sampson</i>, 197 Cal. App. 4th 1234, 1240\xe2\x80\x931244, 130 Cal. Rptr. 3d 39, 43\xe2\x80\x9346 (2011).  The panel below recognized as much: \xe2\x80\x9cIf AEDPA applies here, we are bound by our decision in <i>Nevarez</i> and must affirm the district court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  803 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 418.  AEDPA applies here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The petition for a writ of certiorari and Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In <i>Griggs</i> v. <i>Superior Ct. of San Bernardino Cty.</i>, 16 Cal.\xc2\xa03d 341, 347, 546 P.\xc2\xa02d 727, 731 (1976), the Supreme Court of California stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general rule,\xe2\x80\x9d if a prisoner files a habeas petition challenging the conditions of his confinement in a county other than the one in which he is confined, the court should not deny the petition unless it fails to state a prima facie case.

In this case, the parties agree that a California Superior Court denied a petition for improper venue because it was filed in the wrong county.  The California Supreme Court later denied the same petition for no explained reason.  Applying <i>Ylst</i>\xe2\x80\x99s commonsense presumption, it is \xe2\x80\x9cmost improbable\xe2\x80\x9d that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s unexplained order disagreed with the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned order.  <i>Id.,</i> at 804.  We should therefore presume that the California Supreme Court denied Antonio Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition because he filed the first one in the wrong county.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court, however, believes there is <i>strong</i> evidence to the contrary\xe2\x80\x94for two inexplicable reasons.  The first reason\xe2\x80\x94the California Supreme Court could not have denied the petition for \xe2\x80\x9cimproper venue\xe2\x80\x9d because there is only one California Supreme Court, <i>ante,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x94is a straw man, and a poorly constructed one at that.  Obviously the California Supreme Court did not deny Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s petition because he filed it in the wrong State Supreme Court.  But it easily could have denied his petition because it agreed with the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that he filed the first petition in the wrong county.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re Steele</i>, 32 Cal. 4th 682, 692, 85 P.\xc2\xa03d 444, 449 (2004).  That possibility becomes even more likely in light of California\xe2\x80\x99s atypical habeas rules, which treat an original habeas petition to the California Supreme Court as the commonplace method for seeking review of a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  See <i>Carey</i> v. <i>Saffold</i>,\n\n536 U. S. 214\n\xe2\x80\x93222 (2002).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*  By issuing a silent order after reviewing the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned decision, the California Supreme Court presumably denied Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s petition on the same ground.  Cf. <i>Ylst</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 800 (applying its presumption on an identical posture out of California).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s second reason is even flimsier.  The majority suggests that the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s order did not include the words \xe2\x80\x9cwithout prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore could not have agreed with the Superior Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial\xe2\x80\x94which the majority assumes was without prejudice.  <i>Ante</i>, at 4.  But as the majority quotes, the Superior Court simply \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98DENIED\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the petition; neither it nor the California Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cDENIED\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cwithout prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 2, 4.  It is mindboggling how one opinion necessarily disagrees with another opinion merely because it omits language that the other opinion also lacks.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would hold, as the Ninth Circuit did, that the California Supreme Court presumably agreed with the reasoning of the Superior Court.  See <i>Ylst</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 804.<i> </i>At the very least, I would not hold that there is such \xe2\x80\x9c<i>strong </i>evidence\xe2\x80\x9d to the contrary that we should summarily reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s order\xe2\x80\x94and, in the process, reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s separate conclusion that Hinojosa\xe2\x80\x99s incarceration had been unconstitutionally extended.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, Hinojosa did not file his petition \xe2\x80\x9c[i]nstead of appealing\xe2\x80\x9d the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s denial, <i>ante</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x94his petition was itself his appeal.
