PRAIRIE BAND POTAWATOMI NATION</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the tenth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 04\xe2\x80\x93631.\xe2\x80\x83Argued October 3, 2005\xe2\x80\x94Decided December 6, 2005</p>\n<p align="left">Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 motor fuel tax applies to the receipt of fuel by off-reservation non-Indian distributors who subsequently deliver it to the gas station owned by, and located on the Reservation of, the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (Nation).  The station is meant to accommodate reservation traffic, including patrons driving to the casino the Nation owns and operates there.  Most of the station\xe2\x80\x99s fuel is sold to such patrons, but some sales are made to persons living or working on the reservation.  The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s own tax on the station\xe2\x80\x99s fuel sales generates revenue for reservation infrastructure.  The Nation sued for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the State\xe2\x80\x99s collection of its tax from distributors delivering fuel to the reservation.  Granting the State summary judgment, the District Court determined that the balance of state, federal, and tribal interests tilted in favor of the State under the test set forth in<em> White Mountain Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Bracker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/index.html">448 U. S. 136</a>.  The Tenth Circuit reversed, agreeing with the Nation that the Kansas tax is an impermissible affront to its sovereignty.  The court reasoned that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fuel revenues were derived from value generated primarily on its reservation\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.,</em> the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the casino\xe2\x80\x94and that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s interests in taxing this reservation-created value to raise revenue for reservation infrastructure outweighed the State\xe2\x80\x99s general interest in raising revenues. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> Because Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 motor fuel tax is a nondiscriminatory tax imposed on an off-reservation transaction between non-Indians, the tax is valid and poses no affront to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty.  The <em>Bracker</em> interest-balancing test does not apply to a tax that results from an off-reservation transaction between non-Indians.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The Kansas tax is imposed on non-Indian distributors based upon their off-reservation receipt of motor fuel, not on the on-reservation sale and delivery of that fuel.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Indian tax immunity cases, the \xe2\x80\x9cwho\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cwhere\xe2\x80\x9d of a challenged tax have significant consequences.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe initial and frequently dispositive question \xe2\x80\xa6 is <em>who</em> bears [a tax\xe2\x80\x99s] legal incidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Chickasaw Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html">515 U. S. 450</a>, 458 (emphasis added).  Moreover, the States are categorically barred from placing a tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence \xe2\x80\x9c<em>on a tribe or on tribal members</em> for sales made <em>inside Indian country</em>\xe2\x80\x9d without congressional authorization.  <em>Id.</em>, at 459 (emphasis added).  Even when a State imposes a tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence on a non-Indian seller, the tax may nonetheless be pre-empted if the transaction giving rise to tax liability occurs on the reservation and the imposition of the tax fails to satisfy the <em>Bracker </em>interest-balancing test.  See,<em> e.g., Central Machinery Co.</em> v. <em>Arizona Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/160/index.html">448 U. S. 160</a>.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it is entitled to prevail under <em>Chickasaw</em>\xe2\x80\x99s categorical bar because the fairest reading of the Kansas statute is that the tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence actually falls on the Tribe on the reservation.  Under the statute, the tax\xe2\x80\x99s incidence is expressly imposed on the distributor that first receives the fuel.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive language\xe2\x80\x9d from the state legislature is determinative of who bears a state excise tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence.  <em>Chickasaw, supra</em>, at 461.  Even absent such \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive language,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court would nonetheless conclude that the tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence is on the distributor because Kansas law makes clear that it is the distributor, not the retailer, that is liable for the tax.  The lower courts and the Kansas agency charged with administering the motor fuel tax reached the same conclusion.  <em>Kaul </em>v. <em>Kansas Dept. of Revenue</em>, 266 Kan. 464, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d 60, distinguished.  Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that the <em>Bracker</em> test must be applied irrespective of who bears the Kansas tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence because the tax arises as a result of the <em>on-reservation</em> sale and delivery of fuel.  The Nation presented a starkly different, and correct, interpretation of the statute in the Tenth Circuit, arguing that the balancing test is appropriate even though the tax\xe2\x80\x99s legal incidence is imposed on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s non-Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of fuel <em>outside the reservation</em>.  The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s argument here is rebutted by provisions of the Kansas statute demonstrating that the only taxable event occurs when the distributor first receives the fuel and by a final determination by the State reaching the same conclusion.  The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s theory that the existence of statutory deductions for certain postreceipt transactions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its ultimate tax liability without knowing whether, where, and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered suffers from several conceptual defects.  For example, availability of the deductions does not change the nature of the taxable event, the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of the fuel.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Tenth Circuit erred in concluding that the Kansas tax is nevertheless subject to <em>Bracker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s test.  That test applies only where \xe2\x80\x9ca State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  448 U. S., at 144.  It has never been applied where, as here, a state tax imposed on a non-Indian arises from a transaction occurring off the reservation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s Indian tax immunity cases counsel against such an application.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9318. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Limiting the <em>Bracker</em> test exclusively to <em>on-reservation</em> transactions between a nontribal entity and a tribe or tribal member is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s unique Indian tax immunity jurisprudence, which relies \xe2\x80\x9cheavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty [giving] state law \xe2\x80\x98no role to play\xe2\x80\x99 within a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s territorial boundaries,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Sac and Fox Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/114/index.html">508 U. S. 114</a>, 123\xe2\x80\x93124.  The Court has taken an altogether different course, by contrast, when a State asserts its taxing authority outside of Indian Country.  <em>E.g., Chickasaw</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html">515 U. S. 450</a>.  In such cases, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to non-discriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/index.html">411 U. S. 145</a>, 148\xe2\x80\x93149.  If a State may apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone beyond the reservation\xe2\x80\x99s boundaries, it may also apply a nondiscriminatory tax where, as here, the tax is imposed on non-Indians as a result of an off-reservation transaction.  In these circumstances, <em>Bracker</em> is inapplicable.  Cf. <em>Arizona Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Blaze Constr. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/32/index.html">526 U. S. 32</a>, 37.  The application of the test here is also inconsistent with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to establish \xe2\x80\x9cbright line standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the tax administration context.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Nation is not entitled to interest balancing by virtue of its claim that the Kansas tax interferes with the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s own motor fuel tax.  This is ultimately a complaint about the state tax\xe2\x80\x99s downstream economic consequences.  The Nation cannot invalidate that tax by complaining about a decrease in its revenues.  See, <em>e.g., Washington</em> v. <em>Confederated Tribes of Colville Reservation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/134/index.html">447 U. S. 134</a>, 156.  Nor would the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis change if legal significance were accorded the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s decision to label a portion of its gas station\xe2\x80\x99s revenues as tax proceeds.  See <em>id., </em>at 184, n.\xc2\xa09.  Pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0This Court rejects the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Kansas tax is invalid notwithstanding the<em> Bracker</em> test\xe2\x80\x99s inapplicability because it exempts from taxation fuel sold or delivered to state and federal sovereigns and is therefore impermissibly discriminatory.  The Nation is not similarly situated to the exempted sovereigns.  While Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 tax pays for roads and bridges on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s reservation, including the main highway used by casino patrons, Kansas offers no such services to the several States or the Federal Government.  Moreover, to the extent Kansas retailers bear the tax\xe2\x80\x99s cost, that burden applies equally to all retailers within the State regardless of whether they are located on a reservation.

Kansas applies that tax to motor fuel received by non-Indian fuel distributors who subsequently deliver that fuel to a gas station owned by, and located on, the Reservation of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation (Nation).  The Nation maintains that this application of the Kansas motor fuel tax is an impermissible affront to its sovereignty.  The Court of Appeals agreed, holding that the application of the Kansas tax to fuel received by a non-Indian distributor, but subsequently delivered to the Nation, was invalid under the interest-balancing test set forth in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Bracker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html">448 U.

But the <em>Bracker</em> interest-balancing test applies only where \xe2\x80\x9ca State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id</em>., at 144.  It does not apply where, as here, a state tax is imposed on a non-Indian and arises as a result of a transaction that occurs off the reservation.  Accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation is a federally recognized Indian Tribe whose reservation is on United States trust land in Jackson County, Kansas.  The Nation owns and operates a casino on its reservation.  In order to accommodate casino patrons and other reservation-related traffic, the Nation constructed, and now owns and operates, a gas station on its reservation next to the casino.  Seventy-three percent of the station\xe2\x80\x99s fuel sales are made to casino patrons, while 11 percent of the station\xe2\x80\x99s fuel sales are made to persons who live or work on the reservation.  The Nation purchases fuel for its gas station from non-Indian distributors located off its reservation.  Those distributors pay a state fuel tax on their initial receipt of motor fuel, Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408 (2003 Cum.

It does so notwithstanding the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s decision to pass along the cost of the State\xe2\x80\x99s fuel tax to the Nation, and the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s decision to impose its own tax on the station\xe2\x80\x99s fuel sales in the amount of 16 cents per gallon of gasoline and 18 cents per gallon of diesel (increased to 20 cents for gasoline and 22 cents for diesel in January 2003).  <em>Id.,</em>  at 982.  The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fuel tax generates approximately $300,000 annually, funds that the Nation uses for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98constructing and maintaining roads, bridges and rights-of-way located on or near the Reservation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d including the access road between the state-funded highway and the casino.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation brought an action in Federal District Court for declaratory judgment and injunctive relief from the State\xe2\x80\x99s collection of motor fuel tax from distributors who deliver fuel to the reservation.  The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the State.  Applying the <em>Bracker </em>interest-balancing test, it determined that the balance of state, federal, and tribal interests tilted in favor of the State.  The court reached this determination because \xe2\x80\x9cit is undisputed that the legal incidence of the tax is directed off-reservation at the fuel distributors,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation</em> v. <em>Richards,</em> 241 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1295, 1311 (Kan. 2003), and because the ultimate purchasers of the fuel, non-Indian casino patrons, receive the bulk of their governmental services from the State, <em>id</em>., at 1309.  The court held that the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax did not interfere with the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s right of self-government, adding that \xe2\x80\x9ca tribe cannot oust a state from any power to tax on-reservation purchases by nonmembers of the tribe by simply imposing its own tax on the transactions or by otherwise earning its revenues from the tribal business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit reversed.  379 F.\xc2\xa03d 979 (2004).  It determined that, under <em>Bracker</em>, the balance of state, federal, and tribal interests favored the Tribe.  The Tenth Circuit reasoned that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fuel revenues were \xe2\x80\x9cderived from value generated primarily on its reservation,\xe2\x80\x9d 379 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 984\xe2\x80\x94namely, the creation of a new fuel market by virtue of the presence of the casino\xe2\x80\x94and that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s interests in taxing this reservation-created value to raise revenue for reservation infrastructure outweighed the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral interest in raising revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 986.

The lower courts reached the same conclusion.  379 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 982 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Kansas legislature structured the tax so that its legal incidence is placed on non-Indian distributors\xe2\x80\x9d); 241 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1311 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is undisputed that the legal incidence of the tax is directed off-reservation at the fuel distributors\xe2\x80\x9d); see also<em> Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri </em>v.<em> Pierce</em>, 213 F. 3d 566, 578 (CA10 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legal incidence of the [Kansas] tax law as presently written falls on the fuel distributors rather than on the Tribes\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Winnebago Tribe of Nebraska</em> v. <em>Kline</em>, 297 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1291, 1294 (Kan. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cUnder the Kansas statutory scheme, the legal incidence of the state\xe2\x80\x99s fuel tax falls on the \xe2\x80\x98distributor of first receipt\xe2\x80\x99 of such fuel\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Sac and Fox Nation of Missouri</em> v. <em>LaFaver</em>, 31 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1298, 1307 (Kan. 1998) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he statutes are extremely clear in providing that the tax in question is imposed upon the distributor\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the Kansas Department of Revenue, the state agency charged with administering the motor fuel tax, has concluded likewise.  See<em> </em>Letter from David J. Heinemann, Office of Administrative Appeals, to Mark Burghart, Written Final Determination in Request for Informal Conference for Reconsideration of Agency Action, <em>Davies Oil Co., Inc.,</em> Docket No. 01\xe2\x80\x93970 (Jan. 3, 2002) (hereinafter Kansas Dept. of Revenue Letter) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe legal incidence of the Kansas fuel tax rests with Davies, the distributor, who is up-stream from Nation, the\nretailer\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States, as <em>amicus</em>, contends that this conclusion is foreclosed by the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Kaul </em>v. <em>Kansas Dept. of Revenue</em>, 266 Kan. 464, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d 60 (1998).  The United States reads <em>Kaul </em>as holding that the legal incidence of Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 motor fuel tax rests on the Indian retailers, rather than on the non-Indian distributors.  And, under the United States\xe2\x80\x99 view, so long as the Kansas Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98definitive determination as to the operating incidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of its fuel tax is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98consistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it should be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98deemed conclusive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 10 (quoting <em>Gurley</em> v. <em>Rhoden,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/200/index.html">421 U.

The Kansas Supreme Court determined that the station owners had standing to challenge the tax because the statute provided that the distributor was entitled to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98charge and collect such tax . . . as a part of the selling price.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kaul, supra, </em>at 474, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 67 (quoting Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933409 (1995); emphasis deleted).  The court determined that the station owners were not entitled to an injunction, however, because they were not members of a Kansas Tribe and thus there had \xe2\x80\x9cbeen no showing by Retailers that payment of fuel tax to Kansas interferes with the self-government of a Kansas tribe or a Kansas tribal member.\xe2\x80\x9d  266 Kan., at 464, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 69.  The court then noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal incidence of the tax on motor fuel rests on nontribal members and does not affect the Potawatomi Indian reservation within the state of Kansas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Kaul</em> does not foreclose our determination that the distributor bears the legal incidence of the Kansas motor fuel tax.  As an initial matter, it is unclear whether the court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9cnontribal members\xe2\x80\x9d is a reference to the non-tribal-member retailers or the non-tribal-member distributors.  At the very least, <em>Kaul</em>\xe2\x80\x99s imprecise language cannot be characterized as a definitive determination.  Moreover, the 1998 amendments to the Kansas fuel provisions, including the amendment to \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(c) that provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor,\xe2\x80\x9d were not applied in <em>Kaul.</em> <em>Id., </em>at 473, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d,<em> </em>at 66 (identifying provisions that were repealed in 1998 as being \xe2\x80\x9cin effect during the period relevant to this case\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 474, 970 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 67 (noting that a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical statute\xe2\x80\x9d to its holding was the 1995 version of \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933409, which was amended in 1998).  Accordingly, <em>Kaul </em>did not speak authoritatively on the provisions before us today.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation maintains that we must apply the <em>Bracker</em> interest-balancing test, irrespective of the identity of the taxpayer (<em>i.e.,</em> the party bearing the legal incidence), because the Kansas fuel tax arises as a result of the <em>on-reservation</em> sale and delivery of the motor fuel.  See<em> </em>Brief for Respondent 15.  Notably, however, the Nation presented a starkly different interpretation of the statute in the proceedings before the Court of Appeals, arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he balancing test is appropriate even though the legal incidence of the tax is imposed on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s non-Indian distributor and is triggered by the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of fuel <em>outside the reservation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Reply Brief in No. 03\xe2\x80\x933218 (CA10), p. 3 (emphasis added); see also 241 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1311 (District Court observing that \xe2\x80\x9cit is undisputed that the legal incidence of the tax is directed off-reservation at the fuel distributors\xe2\x80\x9d).  A \xe2\x80\x9cfair interpretation of the taxing statute as written and applied,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chemehuevi Tribe,</em> 474 U. S., at 11, confirms that the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute before the Court of Appeals was correct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As written, the Kansas fuel tax provisions state that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel and such taxes shall be paid but once.  Such tax shall be computed on all motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by each distributor, manufacturer or importer in this state and paid in the manner provided for herein . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(c) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  Under this provision, the distributor who initially receives the motor fuel is liable for payment of the fuel tax, and the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability is determined by calculating the amount of fuel received by the distributor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 79\xe2\x80\x933410(a) (1997) confirms that it is the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s off-reservation receipt of the motor fuel, and not any subsequent event, that establishes tax liability.  That section provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[E]very distributor, manufacturer, importer, exporter or retailer of motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels, on or before the 25th day of each month, shall render to the director . . . a report certified to be true and correct showing the number of gallons of motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by such distributor, manufacturer, importer, exporter or retailer during the preceding calendar month . . . .  Every distributor, manufacturer or importer within the time herein fixed for the rendering of such reports, shall compute and shall pay to the director at the director\'s office the amount of taxes due to the state on all motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels received by such distributor, manufacturer or importer during the preceding calendar month.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThus, Kansas law expressly provides that a distributor\xe2\x80\x99s monthly tax obligations are determined by the amount of fuel received by the distributor during the preceding month.  See <em>Kline</em>, 297 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1294 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe distributor must compute and remit the tax each month for the fuel received by the distributor in the State of Kansas\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation disagrees.  It contends that what is taxed is not the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 (off-reservation) receipt of the fuel, but rather the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 use, sale, or delivery of the motor fuel\xe2\x80\x94in this case, the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 (on-reservation) sale or delivery to the Nation.  The Nation grounds support for this proposition in \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(a) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  That section provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] tax . . . is hereby imposed on the use, sale or delivery of all motor vehicle fuels or special fuels which are used, sold or delivered in this state for any purpose whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  But this section cannot be read in isolation.  If it were, it would permit Kansas to tax the same fuel multiple times\xe2\x80\x94namely, every time fuel is sold, delivered, or used.  Section 79\xe2\x80\x933408(a) must be read in conjunction with subsection (c), which specifies that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel <em>and such taxes shall be paid but once.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The identity of the single, taxable event is revealed in the very next sentence of subsection (c), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch tax shall be computed on all . . . fuels <em>received by each distributor.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  In short, the \xe2\x80\x9cuse, sale or delivery\xe2\x80\x9d that triggers tax liability is the sale or delivery of the fuel to the distributor.  The Kansas Department of Revenue has issued a final determination reaching the same conclusion.  See<em> </em>Kansas Dept. of Revenue Letter (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]ursuant to the Kansas Motor Fuel Tax Act \xe2\x80\xa6 the state fuel tax was imposed on Davies, a distributor, <em>when Davies first received the fuel at its business, a site located off of Nation\xe2\x80\x99s reservation</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation claims further support for its interpretation of the statute in \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(d) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  Section 79\xe2\x80\x933408(d) permits distributors to obtain deductions from the Kansas motor fuel tax for certain postreceipt transactions, such as sale or delivery of fuel for export from the State and sale or delivery of fuel to the United States.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  The Nation argues that these exemptions make it impossible for a distributor to calculate its \xe2\x80\x9cultimate tax liability\xe2\x80\x9d without knowing \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, where, and to whom the fuel is ultimately sold or delivered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 15.  The Nation infers from these provisions that the taxable event is actually the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 postreceipt delivery of fuel to retailers such as the Nation, rather than the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 initial receipt of the fuel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s theory suffers from a number of conceptual defects.  First, under Kansas law, a distributor must pay the tax even for fuel that sits in its inventory\xe2\x80\x94fuel that is not (or at least has not yet been) used, sold, or delivered by the distributor.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  But the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation presumes that the tax is owed <em>only</em> on a distributor\xe2\x80\x99s postreceipt use, sale, or delivery of fuel.  As this interpretation cannot be reconciled with the manner in which the Kansas motor fuel tax is actually applied, it must be rejected.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Second, the availability of tax deductions does not change the nature of the taxable event, here the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of the fuel.  By analogy, an individual federal income taxpayer may reduce his tax liability by paying home mortgage interest.  But that entitlement does not render the taxable event anything other than the receipt of income by the taxpayer.  See 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 (2000 ed. and Supp. II), \xc2\xa7163(h) (2000 ed.); cf. <em>North American Oil Consol.</em> v. <em>Burnet,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/417/index.html">286 U. S. 417</a>, 424 (1932) (federal income tax liability arises when \xe2\x80\x9ca taxpayer \xe2\x80\xa6 has received income\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Nation contends that its interpretation of the statute is supported by Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933417 (1997), which permits a refund\xe2\x80\x94in certain circumstances\xe2\x80\x94for destroyed fuel.  However, the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is actually foreclosed by that section.  Section 79\xe2\x80\x933417 entitles a distributor to a \xe2\x80\x9crefund from the state of the amount of motor-vehicle fuels or special fuels tax paid on any . . . fuels of 100 gallons or more in quantity, which are lost or destroyed at any one time while such distributor is the owner thereof,\xe2\x80\x9d provided the distributor supplies the required notification and documentation to the State.  This section illustrates that a distributor pays taxes for fuel in its possession that it has not delivered or sold, and is only entitled to the refund described in this section for tax it has already paid on fuel that is subsequently destroyed.  While this section does not specify the event that gives rise to the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability, it forecloses the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s contention that such liability does not arise until fuel is sold or delivered to a nonexempt entity.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 fuel tax is imposed on non-Indian distributors based upon those distributors\xe2\x80\x99 off-reservation receipt of motor fuel, the Tenth Circuit concluded that the tax was nevertheless still subject to the interest-balancing test this Court set forth in <em>Bracker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html">448 U. S. 136</a>.  As <em>Bracker</em> itself explained, however, we formulated the balancing test to address the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult questio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d that arises when \xe2\x80\x9ca State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity <em>on the reservation</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (emphasis added).  The <em>Bracker </em>interest-balancing test has never been applied where, as here, the State asserts \nits taxing authority over non-Indians off the reservation.  And although we have never addressed this precise issue, our Indian tax immunity cases counsel against such an application.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have applied the balancing test articulated in <em>Bracker</em> only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal incidence of the tax fell on a nontribal entity engaged in a transaction with tribes or tribal members,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Arizona Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Blaze Constr.

We have explained that this jurisprudence relies \xe2\x80\x9cheavily on the doctrine of tribal sovereignty . . . which historically gave state law \xe2\x80\x98no role to play\xe2\x80\x99 within a tribe\xe2\x80\x99s territorial boundaries.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Sac and Fox Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/114/index.html">508 U.

We have further explained that the doctrine of tribal sovereignty, which has a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant geographical component,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Bracker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 151, requires us to \xe2\x80\x9crevers[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98general rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exemptions from tax laws should . . . be clearly expressed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Sac and Fox</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 124 (quoting <em>McClanahan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 176).  And we have determined that the geographical component of tribal sovereignty \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provide[s] a backdrop against which the applicable treaties and federal statutes must be read.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sac and Fox</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 124 (quoting <em>McClanahan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 172).  Indeed, the particularized inquiry we set forth in <em>Bracker</em> relied specifically on that backdrop.  See 448 U. S., at 144\xe2\x80\x93145 (noting that where \xe2\x80\x9ca State asserts authority over the conduct of non-Indians engaging in activity <em>on the reservation</em> . . . we have examined the language of the relevant federal treaties and statutes in terms of both the broad policies that underlie them and the notions of sovereignty that have developed from historical traditions of tribal independence\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have taken an altogether different course, by contrast, when a State asserts its taxing authority outside of Indian Country.  Without applying the interest-balancing test, we have permitted the taxation of the gross receipts of an off-reservation, Indian-owned ski resort, <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/index.html">411 U. S. 145</a> (1973), and the taxation of income earned by Indians working on-reservation but living off-reservation, <em>Chickasaw</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html">515 U. S. 450</a>.  In these cases, we have concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mescalero Apache</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 148\xe2\x80\x93149; <em>Chickasaw</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 465 (quoting <em>Mescalero Apache</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 148\xe2\x80\x93149).  If a State may apply a nondiscriminatory tax to Indians who have gone beyond the boundaries of the reservation, then it follows that it may apply a nondiscriminatory tax where, as here, the tax is imposed on non-Indians as a result of an off-reservation transaction.  In these circumstances, the interest-balancing test set forth in <em>Bracker</em> is inapplicable.  Cf. <em>Blaze Constr.</em>, 526 U. S., at 37 (declining to apply the <em>Bracker</em> interest-balancing test \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a State seeks to tax a transaction [on-reservation] between the Federal Government and its non-Indian private contractor\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The application of the interest-balancing test to the Kansas motor fuel tax is not only inconsistent with the special geographic sovereignty concerns that gave rise to that test, but also with our efforts to establish \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line standard[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of tax administration.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe need to avoid litigation and to ensure efficient tax administration counsels in favor of a bright-line standard for taxation of federal contracts, regardless of whether the contracted-for activity takes place on Indian reservations\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Chickasaw</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 460 (noting that the legal incidence test \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provide[s] a reasonably bright-line standard\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>County of Yakima</em> v. <em>Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakima Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/251/index.html">502 U. S. 251</a>, 267\xe2\x80\x93268 (1992).  Indeed, we have recognized that the <em>Bracker</em> interest-balancing test \xe2\x80\x9conly cloud[s]\xe2\x80\x9d our efforts to establish such standards.  <em>Blaze Constr.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 37.  Under the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s view, however, any off-reservation tax imposed on the manufacture or sale of any good imported by the Nation or one of its members would be subject to interest balancing.  Such an expansion of the application of the <em>Bracker </em>test is not supported by our cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the Nation entitled to interest balancing by virtue of its claim that the Kansas motor fuel tax interferes with its own motor fuel tax.  As an initial matter, this is ultimately a complaint about the downstream economic consequences of the Kansas tax.  As the owner of the station, the Nation will keep every dollar it collects above its operating costs.  Given that the Nation sells gas at prevailing market rates, its decision to impose a tax should have no effect on its net revenues from the operation of the station; it should not matter whether those revenues are labeled \xe2\x80\x9cprofits\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctax proceeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Nation merely seeks to increase those revenues by purchasing untaxed fuel.  But the Nation cannot invalidate the Kansas tax by complaining about a decrease in revenues.  See <em>Colville</em>, 447 U. S., at 156 (\xe2\x80\x9cWashington does not infringe the right of reservation Indians to \xe2\x80\x98make their own laws and be ruled by them,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Lee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/index.html"></a><a href="/us/358/217/index.html">358 U. S. 217</a>, 220 (1959), merely because the result of imposing its taxes will be to deprive the Tribes of revenues which they currently are receiving\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor would our analysis change if we accorded legal significance to the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s decision to label a portion of the station\xe2\x80\x99s revenues as tax proceeds.  See <em>id., </em>at 184, n.\xc2\xa09 (Rehnquist, J., concurring in part, concuring in result in part, and dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen two sovereigns have legitimate authority to tax the same transaction, exercise of that authority by one sovereign does not oust the jurisdiction of the other.  If it were otherwise, we would not be obligated to pay federal as well as state taxes on our income or gasoline purchases.

But the Nation is not similarly situated to the sovereigns exempted from the Kansas fuel tax.  While Kansas uses the proceeds from its fuel tax to pay for a significant portion of the costs of maintaining the roads and bridges on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s reservation, including the main highway used by the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s casino patrons, Kansas offers no such services to the several States or the Federal Government.  Moreover, to the extent Kansas fuel retailers bear the cost of the fuel tax, that burden falls equally upon all retailers within the State regardless of whether those retailers are located on an Indian reservation.  Accordingly, the Kansas motor fuel tax is not impermissibly discriminatory.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Kansas motor fuel tax is a nondiscriminatory tax imposed on an off-reservation transaction between non-Indians.

See Kansas Form MF\xe2\x80\x9352, available at http://www.ksrevenue.org/pdf/forms/mf52.pdf (as visited Nov. 21, 2005, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The form instructs distributors to enter in line 1 \xe2\x80\x9cthe total net gallons of gasoline, gasohol and special fuel received or imported\xe2\x80\x9d during the preceding month.  <em>Id.,</em> at 2.  The distributors may then \xe2\x80\x9c[e]nter the deductions that apply to your business\xe2\x80\x9d in lines 2(a)-to-(e) for the preceding month.  Those deductions include \xe2\x80\x9c[n]et gallons of fuel exported from Kansas,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[n]et gallons of fuel sold to the U. S. Government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[n]et gallons of fuel sold for aviation purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]et gallons of dyed diesel fuel <em>received</em> for the month,\xe2\x80\x9d the very deductions described in \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(d), <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The distributor\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability is then calculated by subtracting the total deductions from the total fuel received, and applying the 2.5 percent handling allowance to the difference.  Thus, the event that generates a distributor\xe2\x80\x99s tax liability is its receipt of fuel.  And the distributor must pay tax on that fuel even if it is not subsequently delivered or sold.  While a distributor may decrease its tax liability by engaging in transactions that entitle it to deductions, such as by selling or delivering fuel to an exempt entity like the United States, its tax liability is unaffected by sales or deliveries to nonexempt entities like the Nation.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, the dissent acknowledges that tax is owed on fuel a distributor receives and holds in inventory\xe2\x80\x94and thus implicitly concedes that the distributors\xe2\x80\x99 off-reservation receipt of motor fuel is the event that gives rise to tax liability.  See <em>post</em>, at 5 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  While the dissent contends that such tax is ultimately \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively offset\xe2\x80\x9d by a subsequent delivery of the inventoried fuel, <em>ibid.,</em> the dissent does not explain the meaning of this opaque contention.  A distributor\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent delivery of fuel to the Nation or any other fuel retailer in Kansas has <em>no effect </em>on tax that it has already paid in a preceding month.  Indeed, the distributor does not report delivery to retailers on its monthly tax return.  See Kansas Form MF\xe2\x80\x9352.  And a distributor must pay the tax even if the fuel is <em>never </em>delivered.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our recent discussion in <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n </em>v. <em>Chickasaw Nation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html"></a><a href="/us/515/450/index.html">515 U.

On nearby tribal land, as an adjunct to its casino, the Nation built, owns, and operates a gas station known as the Nation Station.

Effectively double-taxed, the Nation Station must operate as an unprofitable venture, or not at all.  In these circumstances, which tax is paramount?  Applying the interest-balancing approach described in <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Bracker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/136/index.html">448 U.

In that case, Arizona sought to enforce its fuel-use and vehicle-license taxes against a non-Indian enterprise that contracted with the White Mountain Apache Tribe to harvest timber from reservation forests.  448 U. S., at 138\xe2\x80\x93140.  The Court recognized that Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s levies raised difficult questions concerning \xe2\x80\x9cthe boundaries between state regulatory authority and tribal self-government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 141.  Determining whether taxes formally imposed on non-Indians are preempted, the Court instructed, should not turn \xe2\x80\x9con mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty, but [calls] for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 145.  This inquiry is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to determine whether, in the specific context, the exercise of state authority would violate federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, or \xe2\x80\x9cunlawfully infringe \xe2\x80\x98on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 142 (quoting <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Lee,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/index.html"></a><a href="/us/358/217/index.html">358 U.

See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Cotton Petroleum Corp.</em> v. <em>New Mexico,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/163/index.html">490 U.

Reply Brief 2\xe2\x80\x936.  Given these circumstances, Kansas urges and the Court accepts, no balancing is in order.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313; Brief for Petitioner 6, 14\xe2\x80\x9321.  It is irrelevant in the State\xe2\x80\x99s calculus that its approach would effectively nullify the tribal fuel tax.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I note first that Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 placement of the legal incidence of the fuel tax is not as clear and certain as the State suggests and the Court holds.  True, the statute states that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor of the first receipt of the motor fuel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kan. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(c) (2003 Cum. Supp.).  But the statute declares initially that the tax \xe2\x80\x9cis hereby imposed on the use, sale or delivery of all motor vehicle fuels \xe2\x80\xa6 used, sold or delivered in this state for any purpose whatsoever,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(a), and it authorizes distributors to pass on the tax to retailers, \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933409.  Notably, the statute excludes from taxation several \xe2\x80\x9ctransactions,\xe2\x80\x9d including the \xe2\x80\x9csale or delivery of motor-vehicle fuel \xe2\x80\xa6 for export from the state of Kansas to any other state or territory or to any foreign country\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9csale or delivery \xe2\x80\xa6 to the United States\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9csale or delivery \xe2\x80\xa6 to a contractor for use in performing work for the United States\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9csale or delivery \xe2\x80\xa6 to another duly licensed distributor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(d).  Kansas also excludes from taxation \xe2\x80\x9clost or destroyed\xe2\x80\x9d fuel, which is never sold by the distributor.  \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933417 (1997).  These provisions indicate not only that the Kansas Legislature anticipated that distributors would shift the tax burden further downstream.  They reveal as well where the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the fuel tax goes awry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When all the exclusions are netted out, the Kansas tax is imposed not on all the distributor\xe2\x80\x99s receipts, but effectively <em>only </em>on fuel actually <em>resold </em>by the distributor to an in-state nonexempt purchaser.  To illustrate: Suppose in January a distributor acquires 100,000 gallons of fuel and promptly sells 80,000 to in-state nonexempt purchasers and 20,000 to exempt purchasers, for example, the United States or a U. S. contractor.  The distributor would compute its tax liability by \xe2\x80\x9cdeducting\xe2\x80\x9d the 20,000 gallons, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa03, but would <em>remit tax </em>only on the 80,000 gallons bought by in-state nonexempt retailers.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  If the distributor elected to build inventory in January by holding an additional 10,000 gallons for resale in February, Kansas would tax in January, but the distributor would effectively offset in February the tax paid in January on the inventory buildup.  Again, in the end, only fuel actually sold to in-state nonexempt buyers would be burdened by Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 fuel tax.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 attribution of controlling effect to the formal legal incidence of the tax rests in part on the State\xe2\x80\x99s misreading of <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Chickasaw Nation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/450/index.html">515 U.

The Court in that case distinguished instances in which the legal incidence of a State\xe2\x80\x99s excise tax rests on a Tribe or tribal members, from instances in which the legal incidence rests on non-Indians.  When \xe2\x80\x9cthe legal incidence \xe2\x80\xa6 rests on a tribe or on tribal members for sales made inside Indian country,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe tax cannot be enforced absent clear congressional authorization.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U. S., at 459.  This \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line standard,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 460, is sensitive to the sovereign status of Indian Tribes, and reflects the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that \xe2\x80\x9ctribal sovereignty is dependent on, and subordinate to, only the Federal Government, not the States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Colville</em>, 447 U.

In cases of this genre, <em>Chickasaw Nation</em> recognized, the Court has resisted adoption of a categorical rule.  In lieu of attributing dispositive significance to the legal incidence, the Court has focused on the particular levy, and has evaluated the federal, state, and tribal interests at stake.  515 U. S., at 459; see <em>Cotton Petroleum</em>, 490 U.

S., at 460.  Kansas took the cue.  After our decision in <em>Chickasaw Nation</em>, Kansas amended its fuel tax statute to state that \xe2\x80\x9cthe incidence of this tax is imposed on the distributor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kan. Stat.

At the same time, <em>Chickasaw Nation</em> indicated that a shift in the legal incidence of the kind Kansas has legislated would trigger\xe2\x80\x94not foreclose\xe2\x80\x94interest balancing.  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kansas and the Court heavily rely upon <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/index.html">411 U.

This Court upheld New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of a tax on the gross receipts of the resort.  Balancing was not in order, the Court explained, because the Tribe had ventured outside its own domain, and was fairly treated, for gross receipts purposes, just as a non-Indian enterprise would be.  In such cases, the Court observed, an express-preemption standard is appropriately applied.  As the Court put it: \xe2\x80\x9cAbsent express federal law to the contrary, Indians going beyond reservation boundaries have generally been held subject to nondiscriminatory state law otherwise applicable to all citizens of the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 148\xe2\x80\x93149.

As earlier explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, one can demur to the assertion that the legal incidence of the tax falls on the distributor, a nontribal entity.  With respect to sales and deliveries to the Nation Station, however, the nontribal entity can indeed be described as \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in [an on-reservation] transaction with [a Tribe].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arizona Dept. of Revenue</em> v. <em>Blaze Constr.

The destination of the fuel counts not only under \xc2\xa779\xe2\x80\x933408(a) (2003 Cum.

As earlier explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, the tax is in reality imposed only on fuel actually resold by the distributor to an in-state nonexempt purchaser.

The one the Court adopts inevitably means, so long as the State officially places the burden on the non-Indian distributor in cases of this order, the Tribe loses.  <em>Faute de mieux</em> and absent congressional instruction otherwise, I would adhere to precedent calling for \xe2\x80\x9ca particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bracker</em>,<em> </em>448 U.

The shared interest of the Federal Government and the Nation in improving reservation roads is reflected in Department of the Interior regulations implementing the Indian Reservation Roads Program.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 43090 (2004); 25 CFR \xc2\xa7170 <em>et seq</em>.<em> </em>(2005).  The regulations aim at enhancing the ability of tribal governments to promote road construction and maintenance.

See <em>id.,</em> at 982; Brief for Respondent 12 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he tax revenues at issue\xe2\x80\x94roughly $300,000 annually\xe2\x80\x94are less than one-tenth of one percent of the total state fuel tax revenues\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cKansas uses the proceeds from its fuel tax to pay for a significant portion of the costs of maintaining the roads and bridges on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  The record reveals a different reality.  According to the affidavit of the Director of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s Road and Bridge Department, Kansas and its subdivisions have failed to provide proper maintenance even on their own roads running through the reservation.  App. 79.  As a result, the Nation has had to assume responsibility for a steadily growing number of road miles within the reservation (roughly 118 of the 212 total miles in 2000).  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also Brief for Respondent 3, 40, 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Of greater significance, Kansas expends <em>none</em> of its fuel tax revenue on the upkeep or improvement of tribally owned reservation roads.  379 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 986\xe2\x80\x93987; cf. <em>Ramah</em>, 458 U.

And, as indicated earlier, <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, Kansas accords the Nation no dispensation based on the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s sovereign status.  The Nation thus receives neither a state exemption so that it can impose its own fuel tax, nor a share of the State\xe2\x80\x99s fuel tax revenues. Accordingly, the net result of invalidating Kansas\xe2\x80\x99 tax as applied to fuel distributed to the Nation Station would be a somewhat more equitable distribution of road maintenance revenues in Kansas.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kansas argues that, were the Nation to prevail in this case, nothing would stop the Nation from reducing its tax in order to sell gas below the market price.

Were the Nation to pursue such a course, it would be marketing an exemption, much as the smokeshops did in <em>Colville</em>, and hence, interest balancing would likely yield a judgment for the State.  See 447 U. S., at 155\xe2\x80\x93157.  In any event, as the Nation points out, the State could guard against the risk that \xe2\x80\x9cTribes will impose a \xe2\x80\x98nominal tax\xe2\x80\x99 and sell goods at a deep discount on the reservation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 34\xe2\x80\x9335.

Neither the State nor the Nation contests the applicability of this tax to fuel destined for the Nation Station.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court has also applied the interest-balancing approach to other forms of state regulation relating to Indian tribal societies.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>California</em> v. <em>Cabazon Band of Mission Indians,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/202/index.html"></a><a href="/us/480/202/index.html">480 U.

The analogy is misconceived.  An excise tax \xe2\x80\x9cdeduction\xe2\x80\x9d bears no realistic resemblance to a personal income tax deduction provided by Congress for a nonbusiness personal expense.  An excise tax \xe2\x80\x9cdeduction,\xe2\x80\x9d however, may fairly be compared to the standard income tax treatment of merchandise returns.  In any period, goods returned and held for resale offset goods sold, so that only net sales yield gross profits for taxation purposes.  See 26 CFR \xc2\xa71.446\xe2\x80\x931(a)(4)(i) (2005); cf. \xc2\xa71.458\xe2\x80\x931(g) (adjustments under elective treatment of certain post-year-end returns of magazines, paperback books, and recordings).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0If in February, the 10,000 gallons were destroyed and thus not sold, Kansas would nonetheless offset the fuel tax burden as Kan.

S., at 460.  No doubt a tribal retailer may find an upstream state tax on its suppliers less burdensome than a downstream tax on its consumers.  See <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa05.  But administrative ease is hardly the dispositive consideration.  The Court has never limited interest-balancing to state taxes imposed on the non-Indian consumers of tribal enterprises; it has also applied this approach to state regulation of the non-Indian suppliers of tribal enterprises.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Department of Taxation and Finance of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Milhelm Attea &amp; Bros.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/61/index.html">512 U.

See <em>ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0At the Court of Appeals level, the Nation presented no \xe2\x80\x9cstarkly different interpretation of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  This Court, in citing Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Reply Brief 3 to the contrary, apparently failed to read on.  At page 12, the Reply Brief states: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that the state tax is technically imposed off-reservation on a non-Indian is not controlling.  The state tax is directed at and burdens reservation value.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, it is surely putting words in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s mouth to assert that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s view \xe2\x80\xa6 any off-reservation tax imposed on the manufacture or sale of any good imported by the Nation or one of its members would be subject to interest balancing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.  The Nation itself expressly \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not contend \xe2\x80\xa6 that a non-discriminatory, off-reservation state tax of general applicability may be precluded simply because the tax has an adverse economic impact on a Tribe or its members.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 1.  As the Nation points out and the Court of Appeals comprehended, \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual issue presented here [is] the permissibility of a state tax that effectively <em>nullifies</em> a Tribe\xe2\x80\x99s power to impose a comparable tax on fuel sold at market price by a tribally owned, on-reservation gas station.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in the original); see <em>Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation </em>v. <em>Richards</em>, 379 F.\xc2\xa03d 979, 986 (CA10 2004).</p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left"> Tribes, it should be plain, cannot prevail in the interest-balancing analysis simply because they tax the same product or activity that the State seeks to tax.

Otherwise, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Tribes could impose a nominal tax and open chains of discount stores at reservation borders, selling goods of all descriptions at deep discounts and drawing custom from surrounding areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 155; see <em>infra</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0At oral argument, it was suggested that the Nation Station might pass on both taxes to its customers if it were willing to forgo some of its profits.
