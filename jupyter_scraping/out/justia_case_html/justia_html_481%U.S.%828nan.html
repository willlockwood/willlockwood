On October 30, 1984, they were transported to Denver, Colorado, where a group deportation hearing was held for respondents along with 11 other persons, all of whom were, like respondents, Mexican nationals. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  After the hearing, respondents were ordered deported and were bused to El Paso, Texas.  They were deported from El Paso on November 1, 1984.  Each received, at the time of his deportation, a copy of Form I-294, which advised, in both Spanish and English, that a return to the United States without permission following deportation would constitute a felony.</p>\n<p>On December 12, 1984, both respondents were once again separately arrested in Lincoln, Nebraska.  They were subsequently indicted by a grand jury in the District of Nebraska on charges of violating 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1326, which provides:</p>\n<p>"Any alien who -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) has been arrested and deported or excluded and deported, and thereafter"</p>\n<p>"(2) enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in the United States . . . </p><p><a class="page-number" name="831">Page 481 U. S. 831</a></p><p> shall be guilty of a felony, and upon conviction thereof, be punished by imprisonment of not more than two years, or by a fine of not more than $1,000, or both. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]"</p>\n<p>Respondents moved in the District Court to dismiss their indictments on the ground that they were denied fundamentally fair deportation hearings.  They contended that the Immigration Law Judge inadequately informed them of their right to counsel at the hearing, and accepted their unknowing waivers of the right to apply for suspension of deportation. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court ruled that respondents could collaterally attack their previous deportation orders.  <em>United States v. Landeros-Quinones,</em> CR 85-L-06 (Feb. 28, 1985).  It rejected their claims that they were not adequately informed of their right to counsel.  It found, however, that respondents had apparently failed to understand the Immigration Judge\'s explanation of suspension of deportation. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="832">Page 481 U. S. 832</a></p><p> Court concluded that respondents had not made knowing and intelligent waivers of their rights to apply for suspension of deportation or their rights to appeal, finding it</p>\n<p>"inconceivable that they would so lightly waive their rights to appeal, and thus to the relief they now claim entitlement, [<em>sic</em>] if they had been fully apprised of the ramifications of such a choice."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. 23a.  Holding that the</p>\n<p>"failure to overcome these defendants\' lack of understanding about the proceedings, which is apparent from listening to the tape recording, totally undermined the reliability of the proceedings"</p>\n<p>and that "substantial justice was not done," the District Court dismissed the indictments in both cases.  <em>Id.</em> at 26a.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.  781 F.2d 111 (1985).  Noting a conflict among the Circuits regarding whether a defendant prosecuted under \xc2\xa7 1326 may collaterally attack a deportation order, the court agreed with those Courts of Appeals that had concluded that a material element of the offense prohibited by \xc2\xa7 1326 was a "lawful" deportation.  <em>Id.</em> at 112.  It went on to state that principles of fundamental fairness required a pretrial review of the underlying deportation to examine whether the alien received due process of law.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s conclusion that there was a due process violation in this case, holding that,</p>\n<p>"[b]ecause the defendants did not fully understand the proceedings, the hearing was fundamentally unfair, and the deportation order was obtained unlawfully.  Thus, it cannot stand as a material element forming the basis of the charges against the defendants."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 113.

We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Spector,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/169/case.html">343 U. S. 169</a></span> (1952), we left open whether the validity of an underlying order of deportation may be challenged in a criminal prosecution in which that prior deportation is an element of the crime. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Today, we </p><p><a class="page-number" name="834">Page 481 U. S. 834</a></p><p> squarely confront this question in the context of \xc2\xa7 1326, which imposes a criminal penalty on any alien who has been deported and subsequently enters, attempts to enter, or is found in, the United States.  The issue before us is whether a federal court must <em>always</em> accept as conclusive the fact of the deportation order, even if the deportation proceeding was not conducted in conformity with due process. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>The first question we must address is whether the statute itself provides for a challenge to the validity of the deportation order in a proceeding under \xc2\xa7 1326.  Some of the Courts of Appeals considering the question have held that a deportation is an element of the offense defined by \xc2\xa7 1326 only if it is "lawful," [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and that \xc2\xa7 1326 therefore permits collateral </p><p><a class="page-number" name="835">Page 481 U. S. 835</a></p><p> challenge to the legality of an underlying deportation order.  The language of the statute, however, suggests no such limitation, stating simply that "[a]ny alien who has been arrested and deported or excluded and deported," 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1326(1), will be guilty of a felony if the alien thereafter enters, attempts to enter, or is at any time found in, the United States, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1326(2).</p>\n<p>Nor does the sparse legislative history contain any evidence that Congress intended to permit challenge to the validity of the deportation in the \xc2\xa7 1326 proceeding.  Before \xc2\xa7 1326 was enacted, three statutory sections imposed criminal penalties upon aliens who reentered the country after deportation:  8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 180(a) (1946 ed.) (repealed 1952), which provided that any alien who had been "deported in pursuance of law" and subsequently entered the United States would be guilty of a felony; 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 138 (1946 ed.) (repealed 1952), which provided that an alien deported for prostitution, procuring, or similar immoral activity, and who thereafter reentered the United States, would be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a different penalty; and 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 137-7(b) (1946 ed., Supp. V) (repealed 1952), which stated that any alien who reentered the country after being deported for subversive activity would be guilty of a felony and subject to yet a third, more severe penalty. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1365, 82d Cong., 2d Sess., 219-220 (1952). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="836">Page 481 U. S. 836</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Congress thus had available to it in at least one of the predecessor sections -- \xc2\xa7 180(a) -- express language that would have permitted collateral challenges to the validity of deportation proceedings in a criminal prosecution for reentry after deportation. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  It nonetheless failed to include in \xc2\xa7 1326 the "in pursuance of law" language of \xc2\xa7 180(a).  And while there was, at the time of the enactment of \xc2\xa7 1326, some case law suggesting that a collateral attack on a deportation proceeding might, under certain circumstances, be permitted, that principle was not so unequivocally established as to persuade us that Congress must have intended to incorporate that prior law into \xc2\xa7 1326. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Immigration and Nationality Act does include sections that limit judicial review of deportation orders.  8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1105a provides that, outside of enumerated exceptions, the procedures prescribed by Title 28 of the United States Code for review of federal agency orders "shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation."  The enumerated exceptions permit an alien to challenge a deportation order, the validity of which has not previously been judicially determined, in a criminal proceeding against the alien for violation of 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1252(d) or (e), 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1105a(a)(6), and any alien held in custody </p><p><a class="page-number" name="837">Page 481 U. S. 837</a></p><p> pursuant to an order of deportation may obtain judicial review of that order in a habeas corpus proceeding, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1105a(a)(9).  These sections are not directly applicable to this case, since respondents did not ask the District Court to vacate their deportation orders, and the court did not do so.  It ruled only that the orders could not properly be used as the predicate for a \xc2\xa7 1326 conviction.  Yet the text of \xc2\xa7 1105a indicates that Congress considered and addressed some of the various circumstances in which challenges to deportation orders might arise and did not mention \xc2\xa7 1326.  <em>See also</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101(g) ("For the purposes of this chapter any alien ordered deported . . . who has left the United States, shall be considered to have been deported in pursuance of law . . ."); <em>but see Mendez v. INS,</em> 563 F.2d 956, 959 (CA9 1977). [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The text and background of \xc2\xa7 1326 thus indicate no congressional intent to sanction challenges to deportation orders in proceedings under \xc2\xa7 1326.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>That Congress did not intend the validity of the deportation order to be contestable in a \xc2\xa7 1326 prosecution does not end our inquiry.  If the statute envisions that a court may impose a criminal penalty for reentry after any deportation, regardless of how violative of the rights of the alien the deportation proceeding may have been, the statute does not comport with the constitutional requirement of due process. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Our cases establish that where a determination made in an administrative proceeding is to play a critical role in the subsequent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="838">Page 481 U. S. 838</a></p><p> imposition of a criminal sanction, there must be <em>some</em> meaningful review of the administrative proceeding.  <em>See Estep v.

[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  This principle means, at the very least, that, where the defects in an administrative proceeding foreclose judicial review of that proceeding, an alternative means of obtaining judicial review must be made available before the administrative order may be used to establish conclusively an element of a criminal offense. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The result of those proceedings may subsequently be used to convert the misdemeanor of unlawful entry into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="839">Page 481 U. S. 839</a></p><p> the felony of unlawful entry after a deportation.  Depriving an alien of the right to have the disposition in a deportation hearing reviewed in a judicial forum requires, at a minimum, that review be made available in any subsequent proceeding in which the result of the deportation proceeding is used to establish an element of a criminal offense. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Having established that a collateral challenge to the use of a deportation proceeding as an element of a criminal offense must be permitted where the deportation proceeding effectively eliminates the right of the alien to obtain judicial review, the question remains whether that occurred in this case.  The United States did not seek this Court\'s review of the determination of the courts below that respondents\' rights to due process were violated by the failure of the Immigration Judge to explain adequately their right to suspension of deportation or their right to appeal.  Pet. for Cert. 7.  The United States has asked this Court to assume that respondents\' deportation hearing was fundamentally unfair in considering whether collateral attack on the hearing may be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="840">Page 481 U. S. 840</a></p><p> permitted.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7.  We consequently accept the legal conclusions of the court below that the deportation hearing violated due process.  If the violation of respondents\' rights that took place in this case amounted to a complete deprivation of judicial review of the determination, that determination may not be used to enhance the penalty for an unlawful entry under \xc2\xa7 1326.  We think that it did.  The Immigration Judge permitted waivers of the right to appeal that were not the result of considered judgments by respondents, and failed to advise respondents properly of their eligibility to apply for suspension of deportation.  Because the waivers of their rights to appeal were not considered or intelligent, respondents were deprived of judicial review of their deportation proceeding.  The Government may not, therefore, rely on those orders as reliable proof of an element of a criminal offense.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The United States asserts that our decision in <em>Lewis v.

In <em>Lewis,</em> the Court held that a state court conviction, even though it was uncounseled and therefore obtained in violation of the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights of the defendant under <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U.

We do not consider <em>Lewis</em> to control the issues raised by this case.  The question in <em>Lewis</em> was whether Congress could define that "class of persons who should be disabled from dealing in or possessing firearms," 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html#67">445 U.

[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The Court there rejected Lewis\' statutory challenge, holding that Congress had manifested no intent to permit collateral attacks upon the prior state convictions in federal criminal proceedings, and further held that this use of uncounseled prior convictions did not violate the equal protection component of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  In rejecting the notion that the statute permitted, or the Constitution required, this "new form of collateral attack" on prior convictions, the Court pointed to the availability of alternative means to secure judicial review of the conviction:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is important to note that a convicted felon may challenge the validity of a prior conviction, or otherwise remove his disability, before obtaining a firearm."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>It is precisely the unavailability of effective judicial review of the administrative determination at issue here that sets this case apart from <em>Lewis.</em>  The fundamental procedural defects of the deportation hearing in this case rendered direct review of the Immigration Judge\'s determination unavailable to respondents.  What was assumed in <em>Lewis,</em> namely the opportunity to challenge the predicate conviction in a judicial forum, was precisely that which was denied to respondents here.  Persons charged with crime are entitled to have the factual and legal determinations upon which convictions are based subjected to the scrutiny of an impartial judicial officer. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="842">Page 481 U.

Under different circumstances, the propriety of using an administrative ruling in such a way remains open to question.  We do not reach this issue here, however, holding that, at a minimum, the result of an administrative proceeding may not be used as a conclusive element of a criminal offense where the judicial review that legitimated such a practice in the first instance has effectively been denied.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>A number of commentators have expressed the notion that, where the deportation proceeding violated fundamental fairness, its validity may be challenged in a criminal proceeding under \xc2\xa7 1326.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Comment, Collateral Attacks on Deportation Orders in Prosecutions for Illegal Reentry, 48 U.Chi.L.Rev. 83, 90-91, 102-103 (1981) (where alien was denied fundamental fairness at the deportation hearing, collateral attacks in \xc2\xa7 1326 proceedings would be proper); Note, Collaterally Attacking Deportation Orders in Criminal Prosecutions for Illegal Reentry Under Section 276 of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, 56 Notre Dame Law. 677, 686-688 (1981) (fundamental fairness requires some form of collateral review of civil deportation proceedings which have criminal consequences).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>We decline at this stage to enumerate which procedural errors are so fundamental that they may functionally deprive the alien of judicial review, requiring that the result of the hearing in which they took place not be used to support a criminal conviction.

The court, however, treated the issue as subsidiary to its determination that the Immigration Judge did not fully apprise respondents of their rights to apply for suspension of deportation.  In ultimately disposing of the issue, the court stated:</p>\n<p>"In light of their claimed eligibility for suspension of deportation, . . . I find it inconceivable that they would so lightly waive their rights to appeal, and thus to the relief they now claim entitlement, [<em>sic</em>] if they had been fully apprised of the ramifications of such a choice."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Landeros-Quinones, supra,</em> at 12.</p>\n<p>The narrow scope of the District Court\'s resolution of the question whether respondents had effectively waived their appeal rights is further demonstrated by the District Court\'s examination of the prejudice resulting from the manner in which the deportation hearing was conducted.  Determining that a showing of prejudice was a necessary predicate to a successful collateral attack to a prior deportation order, the court concluded that there was a substantial likelihood that respondents were harmed by "the failure of the Immigration Law Judge to fully comply with the provisions of 8 C.F.R. \xc2\xa7 242.17," the regulation governing notification of apparent eligibility for suspension of deportation.  <em>Id.</em> at 14.  Yet, aside from possible harm to respondents resulting from their failure to pursue suspension of deportation relief, the District Court did not identify any prejudice from respondents\' failure to appeal.  From these findings of the District Court, the most that can be said with certainty is that the court determined that respondents did not understand that they could pursue their claimed eligibility for suspension of deportation in further proceedings.</p>\n<p>In affirming the District Court\'s decision in this case, the Court of Appeals did not at all address the question whether respondents knowingly waived their rights to appeal, but instead </p><p><a class="page-number" name="844">Page 481 U.

Without such a finding, the only articulated basis for the Court\'s due process holding is respondents\' claim that their deportation orders were invalid because they were not adequately informed that they could apply for suspension of deportation.  The Court\'s acceptance of this latter claim provides little foundation for its decision.</p>\n<p>Recognizing that Congress intended to limit the number of aliens qualifying for suspension of deportation, we have interpreted the statutory section providing for such relief, 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1254(a)(1), as establishing strict threshold criteria that must be met before the Attorney General may grant the relief.  <em>See INS v.

For example, the District Court noted that the Immigration Judge commenced the hearing by instructing respondents</p>\n<p>"that, if any of them did not understand any of the proceedings, to raise their hands and their misunderstandings would be addressed so as to eliminate any confusion."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Landeros-Quinones,</em> No. CR85-L-06, p. 9 (Neb., Feb. 28, 1985).  Respondents indicated their understanding of this arrangement.  Moreover, the Immigration Judge informed respondents that they were entitled to be represented by counsel, and made certain that they received a list of the free legal services available to them.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge asked respondents whether they wished to accept his ruling that they were deportable, appeal the ruling, or reserve decision, and respondents each stated that they accepted the judge\'s ruling.  Under these circumstances, I cannot say that respondents\' deportation proceedings violated the dictates of the Due </p><p><a class="page-number" name="846">Page 481 U. S. 846</a></p><p> Process Clause. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html">*</a></span> I would therefore hold that the courts below erred in concluding that respondents\' prior deportation orders may not be used in the \xc2\xa7 1326 proceedings brought against them.</p>\n<p>* Because the Government took the position before this Court that deportation orders may never be collaterally attacked in a \xc2\xa7 1326 proceeding, it did not request the Court to pass on the question whether respondents\' deportation proceedings violated their due process rights.  The Government, however, has not conceded that the deportation proceedings were fundamentally unfair.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 13-14.  Because the fairness of these proceedings was litigated in the courts below and is a matter subsumed in the precise question presented for this Court\'s review, it cannot be seriously argued that the issue is not properly before this Court.  Indeed, the Court itself has chosen to decide the issue, albeit in a manner different from that suggested here.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE SCALIA, dissenting.</p>\n<p>When respondents were deported from the United States in October, 1984, they were specifically warned that 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1326 made it a felony for them to reenter the United States illegally.  Two months later, they were apprehended in the United States and charged with violating \xc2\xa7 1326.  Respondents assert that, even if their reentry was illegal, they cannot lawfully be punished for violating \xc2\xa7 1326, because the proceedings in which they were originally deported violated the Due Process Clause. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I agree with the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="847">Page 481 U. S. 847</a></p><p> Court that the lawfulness of respondents\' original deportation proceedings is irrelevant to the question whether respondents violated \xc2\xa7 1326.  I dissent, however, because I do not share the Court\'s view that the lawfulness of those proceedings is relevant to the question whether respondents may constitutionally be punished if they violated \xc2\xa7 1326.</p>\n<p>I think it clear that Congress may constitutionally make it a felony for deportees -- irrespective of the legality of their deportations -- to reenter the United States illegally.  <em>See Lewis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html">445 U. S. 55</a></span> (1980) (Congress may constitutionally make it a felony for convicted felons -- irrespective of the legality of their convictions -- to deal in or possess firearms). [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  The sole ground upon which the Court attempts to distinguish <em>Lewis</em> is that, in this case, respondents were completely foreclosed from obtaining "effective judicial review" of their deportations, while in <em>Lewis,</em> the felons could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="848">Page 481 U. S. 848</a></p><p> have obtained collateral review of their convictions before obtaining firearms.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#837">481 U. S. 837</a></span>-840,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#841">481 U. S. 841</a></span>.  It is true that the Court in <em>Lewis</em> relied on the availability of collateral review.  445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html#64">445 U. S. 64</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html#67">445 U. S. 67</a></span>.  But, contrary to the Court\'s implication, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#837">481 U. S. 837</a></span>, neither <em>Lewis</em> nor any of the other cases relied upon by the Court squarely holds that the Due Process Clause invariably forbids reliance upon the outcome of unreviewable administrative determinations in subsequent criminal proceedings.  <em>See McKart v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/185/case.html">395 U. S. 185</a></span> (1969) (interpreting a statute to permit collateral attack of prior administrative orders); <em>Estep v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/327/114/case.html">327 U. S. 114</a></span> (1946) (same); <em>Yakus v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/case.html">321 U. S. 414</a></span> (1944) (interpreting a statute to forbid collateral attack of earlier administrative orders).</p>\n<p>The Court\'s apparent adoption of that conclusion today seems to me wrong.  To illustrate that point by one out of many possible examples, imagine that a State establishes an administrative agency that (after investigation and full judicial-type administrative hearings) periodically publishes a list of unethical businesses.  Further imagine that the State, having discovered that a number of previously listed businesses are bribing the agency\'s investigators to avoid future listing, passes a law making it a felony for a business that has been listed to bribe agency investigators.  It cannot be that the Due Process Clause forbids the State to punish violations of that law unless it either makes the agency\'s listing decisions judicially reviewable or permits those charged with violating the law to defend themselves on the ground that the original listing decisions were in some way unlawful.</p>\n<p>Even if I believed the availability of "effective judicial review" to be relevant, I would still dissent, because review was available here.  It is true, as the Court notes, that the District Court found that respondents\' waivers of any appeal from the Immigration Judge\'s deportation order were "not the result of considered judgments," App. to Pet. for Cert. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="849">Page 481 U. S. 849</a></p><p> 23a, because they were affected by the Immigration Judge\'s failure adequately to explain to respondents that they could apply for suspension of deportation, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#839">481 U. S. 839</a></span>.  There is a world of difference, however, between denial of a right to appeal and failure to assure that parties understand the available grounds for appeal, and forgo them in a "considered" fashion.  Since, to my knowledge, administrative agencies rarely undertake such assurance, the Court\'s unbounded and unexplained conception of "effective" denial of a right of appeal, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#839">481 U. S. 839</a></span>, n. 17, apparently leads to the peculiar conclusion that administrative proceedings are almost always without judicial review.  I reject this conclusion.</p>\n<p>Moreover, in concluding that the Immigration Judge\'s acceptance of respondents\' unconsidered waivers effectively denied respondents their rights to appeal, the Court completely ignores the possibility that, notwithstanding their waivers and the fact that they had been deported, respondents could still have appealed their deportations on the ground that the deportations were unlawful and the waivers were unlawfully secured, <em>cf., e.g., Mendez v. INS,</em> 563 F.2d 956, 959 (CA9 1977), or could have brought other collateral challenges to their deportations.  I express no view on the question whether such suits would have been permissible under the applicable statutes, <em>see, e.g.,</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1101(g), but merely note that a negative answer to that question is a necessary, and entirely unexplained, component of the Court\'s holding. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="850">Page 481 U. S. 850</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For these reasons, I think that, if respondents\' reentry into the United States was unlawful, respondents may constitutionally be punished for violating \xc2\xa7 1326.  I would reverse the contrary judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court and the Court of Appeals both held that the proceedings in question violated the Due Process Clause.  I agree with the Court that, because the Government did not ask us to review those holdings, <em>see</em> Pet. for Cert. 7, n. 6; Brief for United States 5-6, n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 6-7, it is not appropriate to do so.  <em>See</em> this Court\'s Rule 21.1(a) ("Only the questions set forth in the petition or fairly included therein will be considered by the Court").  <em>See also e.g., INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html">480 U. S. 421</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/480/421/case.html#448">480 U. S. 448</a></span>-449, n. 32 (1987).  In arguing to the contrary, THE CHIEF JUSTICE first observes that the lawfulness of respondents\' deportation proceedings was litigated in the Court of Appeals, and that the Government has not conceded the point.  <em>Ante</em> this page, n.  While these observations dispose of other possible objections to consideration of the unchallenged holdings, they in no way displace the application of Rule 21.1(a).  THE CHIEF JUSTICE also suggests that the dissent is free to consider the due process holdings because the Court itself does.  <em>Ibid.</em>  But I understand the Court to accept, rather than review, the holdings.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#840">481 U. S. 840</a></span>.  Finally, THE CHIEF JUSTICE asserts that the question of the correctness of the holdings is "subsumed in the precise question presented for this Court\'s review."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#846">481 U. S. 846</a></span>, n.  I disagree.  As formulated by the Government, the question presented is</p>\n<p>"Whether a defendant prosecuted under 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1326 for reentering the United States after having been deported may collaterally attack the validity of his deportation proceeding?"</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. I.  I fail to see how there is subsumed within this the question whether a collateral attack in the present case would be successful.  But for these points, I would agree with THE CHIEF JUSTICE that no due process violation occurred.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Lewis</em> involved a statute that relied upon the fact of a prior <em>criminal</em> conviction, rather than, as in this case, the fact of a prior <em>civil</em> deportation.  As the Court notes, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/481/828/case.html#838">481 U. S. 838</a></span>, n. 15, it has been suggested that the Constitution may, in some circumstances, forbid use of the outcomes of administrative proceedings -- even those lawfully conducted and subject to judicial review -- in subsequent criminal proceedings.  Whether or not that is so, I do not believe this case presents such circumstances.  In any event, respondents have not claimed that it does, instead arguing only that they must be permitted to show that their deportation proceedings were not lawfully conducted.  The validity of that argument can have nothing to do with whether the proceedings were administrative or criminal.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Nor could it be argued that, although avenues of judicial review were theoretically available, respondents -- not having been informed of the grounds upon which they should seek relief -- could not reasonably have been expected to pursue them.  That argument plainly is foreclosed by <em>Lewis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html">445 U. S. 55</a></span> (1980), in which the Court rejected the analogous argument, advanced by the dissent, that it was unreasonable to rely on the availability of collateral relief where the defect in the original proceeding was that the felon lacked the assistance of counsel.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/55/case.html#73">445 U.
