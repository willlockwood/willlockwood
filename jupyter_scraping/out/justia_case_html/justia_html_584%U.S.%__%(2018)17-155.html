No single interpretation or rationale commanded a majority, however.  Some Courts of Appeals, turning to <i>Marks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 188, for guidance, adopted the reasoning of Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion concurring in the judgment.  Others interpreted <i>Marks</i> differently and adopted the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  Because this Court can now resolve the substantive, sentencing issue discussed in <i>Freeman, </i>it is unnecessary to reach questions regarding the proper application of <i>Marks</i>. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 authorizes the United States Sentencing Commission to establish, and retroactively amend, Sentencing Guidelines.  Though the Guidelines are only advisory, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220, a district court must consult them during sentencing, <i>id., </i>at 264, along with other factors specified in\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a), including \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73553(a)(6).  When an amendment applies retroactively, district courts may reduce the sentences of prisoners whose sentences were \xe2\x80\x9cbased on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">This case concerns the issue whether a defendant may seek relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) if he entered a plea agreement under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C) (Type-C agreement), which permits the defendant and the Government to \xe2\x80\x9cagree that a specific sentence or sentencing range is the appropriate disposition of the case,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbinds the court [to the agreed-upon sentence] once [it] accepts the plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  In making its decision, the district court must consider the Sentencing Guidelines.  And it may not accept the agreement unless the sentence is within the applicable Guidelines range, or it is outside that range for justifiable reasons specifically set out.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">After petitioner Erik Hughes was indicted on drug and gun charges, he and the Government negotiated a Type-C plea agreement, which stipulated that Hughes would receive a sentence of 180 months but did not refer to a particular Guidelines range.  Hughes pleaded guilty.  At his sentencing hearing, the District Court accepted the agreement and sentenced him to 180 months.  In so doing, it calculated Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 Guidelines range as 188 to 235 months and determined that the sentence was in accordance with the Guidelines and other factors the court was required to consider.  Less than two months later, the Sentencing Commission adopted, and made retroactive, an amendment that had the effect of reducing Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing range to 151 to 188 months.  The District Court denied Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 motion for a reduced sentence under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2), and the Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  Both courts concluded that, under the <i>Freeman</i> concurrence, Hughes was ineligible for a reduced sentence because his plea agreement did not expressly rely on a Guidelines range.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held:</i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0A sentence imposed pursuant to a Type-C agreement is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range so long as that range was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0A principal purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines is to promote sentencing uniformity.  But in the aftermath of <i>Freeman</i>, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for a reduced sentence under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) turns on the Circuit in which the case arises.  Even within Circuits that follow the <i>Freeman </i>concurrence, unwarranted disparities have resulted depending on whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Type-C agreement has a specific-enough reference to a Guidelines range.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents since <i>Freeman</i> have confirmed that the Guidelines remain the foundation of federal sentencing decisions.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Peugh </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530; <i>Molina-Martinez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0A district court imposes a sentence that is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a Guidelines range for purposes of \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) if the range was a basis for the court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence.  Given the standard legal definition of \xe2\x80\x9cbase,\xe2\x80\x9d there will be no question in the typical case that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range was a basis for his sentence.  A district court is required to calculate and consider a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range in every case.  \xc2\xa73553(a).  Indeed, the Guidelines are \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 542.  Thus, in general, \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) allows district courts to reconsider a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence based on a new starting point\xe2\x80\x94that is, a lower Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94and determine whether a reduction is appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">A sentence imposed pursuant to a Type-C agreement is no exception to the general rule that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range is the starting point and a basis for his ultimate sentence.  The Government and the defendant may agree to a specific sentence, but the Sentencing Guidelines prohibit district courts from accepting Type-C agreements without first evaluating the recommended sentence in light of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range.  So in the usual case the court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of a Type-C agreement and the sentence to be imposed pursuant to that agreement are \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range.  Since the Guidelines are a district court\xe2\x80\x99s starting point, when the Commission lowers the range, the defendant will be eligible for relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) absent clear demonstration, based on the record as a whole, that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This interpretation furthers \xc2\xa73582(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, as well as the broader purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act.  It is also reinforced by <i>Molina-Martinez </i>and <i>Peugh</i>, which both confirm that the Guidelines remain a basis for almost all federal sentences.  Experience has shown that, although the interpretation proffered by Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion in <i>Freeman</i> could be one permissible reading of \xc2\xa73582(c)(2), as a systemic, structural matter the system Congress put in place is best implemented by the interpretation confirmed in this case.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s counterarguments\xe2\x80\x94that allowing defendants with Type-C agreements to seek reduced sentences under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) would deprive the Government of a benefit of its bargain, namely, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to a particular sentence; and that allowing courts to reduce the sentences of defendants like Hughes would be inconsistent with one of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statements\xe2\x80\x94are unpersuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Hughes is eligible for relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).  The District Court accepted his Type-C agreement after concluding that a 180-month sentence was consistent with the Guidelines, and then calculated Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing range and imposed a sentence it deemed \xe2\x80\x9ccompatible\xe2\x80\x9d with the Guidelines.  The sentencing range was thus a basis for the sentence imposed.  And that range has since been lowered by the Commission.  The District Court has discretion to decide whether to reduce Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 sentence after considering the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s relevant policy statements.

Seven Terms ago the Court considered one of these issues in a case involving a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reduce his sentence, where the prisoner had been sentenced under a plea agreement authorized by a specific Rule of criminal procedure.  <i>Freeman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522 (2011).

The courts of appeals then confronted the question of what principle or principles considered in <i>Freeman</i> controlled when an opinion by four Justices and a concurring opinion by a single Justice had allowed a majority of this Court to agree on the judgment in <i>Freeman</i> but not on one interpretation or rule that courts could follow in later cases when similar questions arose under the same statute and Rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For guidance courts turned to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Marks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 188 (1977).  Some courts interpreted <i>Marks</i> as directing them to follow the \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowest\xe2\x80\x9d opinion in <i>Freeman</i> that was necessary for the judgment in that case; and, accordingly, they adopted the reasoning of the opinion concurring in the judgment by Justice Sotomayor.

The first two questions, relating to <i>Marks</i>, are as follows: (1) \xe2\x80\x9cWhether this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Marks</i> means that the concurring opinion in a 4\xe2\x80\x931\xe2\x80\x934 decision represents the holding of the Court where neither the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning nor the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is a logical subset of the other\xe2\x80\x9d; and (2) \xe2\x80\x9cWhether, under <i>Marks</i>, the lower courts are bound by the four-Justice plurality opinion in <i>Freeman</i>, or, instead, by Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s separate concurring opinion with which all eight other Justices disagreed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The third question is directed to the underlying statu- tory issue in this case, the substantive, sentencing issue the Court discussed in the three opinions issued in <i>Freeman</i>.  That question is: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether, as the four-Justice plurality in <i>Freeman</i> concluded, a defendant who enters into a Fed. R. Crim.

So it will be unnecessary to consider questions one and two despite the extensive briefing and careful argument the parties presented to the Court concerning the proper application of <i>Marks</i>.  The opinion that follows resolves the sentencing issue in this case; and, as well, it should give the necessary guidance to federal district courts and to the courts of appeals with respect to plea agreements of the kind presented here and in <i>Freeman</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">With that explanation, the Court now turns to the circumstances of this case and the sentencing issue it presents.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, the United States Sentencing Commission establishes Sentencing Guidelines based on the seriousness of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offense and his criminal history.  <i>Dillon</i> v. <i>United States</i>, \n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 817, 820 (2010).  In combination, these two factors yield a range of potential sentences for a district court to choose from in sentencing a particular defendant.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Sentencing Guidelines provide the framework for the tens of thousands of federal sentencing proceedings that occur each year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Molina-Martinez </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220 (2005), the Guidelines are advisory only.

About four months later, the Government and Hughes negotiated a Type-C plea agreement.  Hughes agreed to plead guilty to two of the four charges (conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine and being a felon in possession of a gun); and in exchange the Government agreed to dismiss the other two charges and to refrain from filing an information giving formal notification to the District Court of his prior drug felonies.

The Commission later made amendment 782 retroactive for defendants who, like Hughes, already had been sentenced under the higher offense levels.  Amdt. 788.

Yet in the aftermath of <i>Freeman</i>, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for a reduced sentence under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) turns on the Circuit in which the case arises.  Further, even within Circuits that follow the <i>Freeman </i>concurrence, unwarranted disparities have resulted depending on the fortuity of whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Type-C agreement includes a specific-enough reference to a Guidelines range.  See Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 13\xe2\x80\x9320.  In some cases defendants have been held ineligible for relief even where the sentencing hearing makes it crystal clear that the Government and the defendant agreed to a Guidelines sentence and the district court imposed one.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>United States </i>v.<i> McNeese</i>, 819 F.\xc2\xa03d 922, 929 (CA6 2016).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents since <i>Freeman</i> have further confirmed that the Guidelines remain the foundation of federal sentencing decisions.  In <i>Peugh </i>v.<i> United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530 (2013), for example, the Court held that the <i>Ex Post Facto</i> Clause prohibits retroactive application of amended Guidelines that increase a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing range.  <i>Id.</i>, at 544.  The Court reasoned that, <i>Booker</i> notwithstanding, the Guidelines remain \xe2\x80\x9cthe lodestone of sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 544.  And in <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, the Court held that in the ordinary case a defendant suffers prejudice from a Guidelines error because of \xe2\x80\x9cthe systemic function of the selected Guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cThe post-<i>Booker</i> federal sentencing scheme aims to achieve uniformity by ensuring that sentencing decisions are anchored by the Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 541.  In this context clarity and consistency are essential.  To resolve the uncertainty that resulted from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s divided decision in <i>Freeman</i>, the Court now holds that a sentence imposed pursuant to a Type-C agreement is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range so long as that range was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As already mentioned, \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) authorizes a district court to reduce a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence if the defendant \xe2\x80\x9chas been sentenced to a term of imprisonment based on a sentencing range that has subsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  A district court imposes a sentence that is \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d a Guidelines range if the range was a basis for the court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion in imposing a sentence.  To \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make, form, or serve as a foundation for,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o use (something) as the thing from which something else is developed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 180 (10th ed. 2014).  Likewise, a \xe2\x80\x9cbase\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he starting point or foundational part of something,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[a] point, part, line, or quantity from which a reckoning or conclusion proceeds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also <i>ibid. </i>(similarly defining \xe2\x80\x9cbasis\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the typical sentencing case there will be no question that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range was a basis for his sentence.  The Sentencing Reform Act requires a district court to calculate and consider a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range in every case.\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  Indeed, the Guidelines are \xe2\x80\x9cthe starting point for every sentencing calculation in the federal system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Peugh</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 542; see also <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court has made clear that the Guidelines are to be the sentencing court\xe2\x80\x99s starting point and initial benchmark\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted)).  \xe2\x80\x9cEven if the sentencing judge sees a reason to vary from the Guidelines, if the judge uses the sentencing range as the beginning point to explain the decision to deviate from it, then the Guidelines are in a real sense the basis for the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis deleted).  In general, \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) allows district courts to reconsider a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence based on a new starting point\xe2\x80\x94that is, a lower Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94and determine whether a reduction in the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A sentence imposed pursuant to a Type-C agreement is no exception to the general rule that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range is both the starting point and a basis for his ultimate sentence.  Although in a Type-C agreement the Government and the defendant may agree to a specific sentence, that bargain is contingent on the district court accepting the agreement and its stipulated sentence.  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 529\xe2\x80\x93530.  The Sentencing Guidelines prohibit district courts from accepting Type-C agreements without first evaluating the recommended sentence in light of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range.  USSG \xc2\xa76B1.2(c).  So in the usual case the court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of a Type-C agreement and the sentence to be imposed pursuant to that agreement are \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be sure, the Guidelines are advisory only, and so not every sentence will be consistent with the relevant Guidelines range.  See <i>Koons </i>v.<i> United States</i>, <i>post</i>, at 5 (defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Guidelines ranges \xe2\x80\x9cclearly did not\xe2\x80\x9d form a basis of the ultimate sentences).  For example, in <i>Koons</i> the Court today holds that five defendants\xe2\x80\x99 sentences were not \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d subsequently lowered Guidelines ranges because in that case the Guidelines and the record make clear that the sentencing judge \xe2\x80\x9cdiscarded\xe2\x80\x9d their sen- tencing ranges \xe2\x80\x9cin favor of mandatory minimums and substantial-assistance factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; see also <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe record in a case may show, for example, that the district court thought the sentence it chose was appropriate irrespective of the Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the Guidelines range was not \xe2\x80\x9ca relevant part of the analytic framework the judge used to determine the sentence or to approve the agreement,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Freeman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 530, then the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was not based on that sentencing range, and relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) is unavail- able.  And that is so regardless of whether a defendant pleaded guilty pursuant to a Type-C agreement or whether the agreement itself referred to a Guidelines range. The statutory language points to the reasons for the sentence that the district court imposed, not the reasons for the parties\xe2\x80\x99 plea agreement.  Still, cases like <i>Koons</i> are a narrow exception to the general rule that, in most cases, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence will be \xe2\x80\x9cbased on\xe2\x80\x9d his Guidelines range.  In federal sentencing the Guidelines are a district court\xe2\x80\x99s starting point, so when the Commission lowers a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range the defendant will be eligible for relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) absent clear demonstration, based on the record as a whole, that the court would have imposed the same sentence regardless of the Guidelines.  See <i>Koons</i>, <i>post</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This interpretation furthers \xc2\xa73582(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, as well as the broader purposes of the Sentencing Reform Act.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Act aims to create a comprehensive sentencing scheme in which those who commit crimes of similar severity under similar conditions receive similar sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 533.  \xe2\x80\x9cSection 3582(c)(2) contri- butes to that goal by ensuring that district courts may adjust sentences imposed pursuant to a range that the Commission concludes [is] too severe, out of step with the seriousness of the crime and the sentencing ranges of analogous offenses, and inconsistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And there is no reason a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for relief should turn on the form of his plea agreement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Two cases decided after <i>Freeman</i> now reinforce this proposition.  See <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9311); <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 541\xe2\x80\x93544.  These cases confirm that the Guidelines remain a basis for almost all federal sentences.  In <i>Peugh</i>, the Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven after <i>Booker</i> rendered the Sentencing Guidelines advisory, district courts have in the vast majority of cases imposed either within-Guidelines sentences or sentences that depart downward from the Guidelines on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s motion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 543.  And in <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Commission\xe2\x80\x99s statistics demonstrate the real and pervasive effect the Guidelines have on sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 10).  In short, experience has shown that, although the interpretation proffered by Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion in <i>Freeman</i> could be one permissible reading of \xc2\xa73582(c)(2), the system Congress put in place is best implemented, as a systemic, structural matter, by the interpretation confirmed in the instant case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D"> In response, the Government largely recycles arguments that a majority of this Court rejected in <i>Freeman</i>.  For example, the Government contends that allowing defendants who enter Type-C agreements to seek reduced sentences under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) would deprive the Government of one of the benefits of its bargain\xe2\x80\x94namely, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to a particular sentence.  But that has nothing to do with whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was based on the Sentencing Guidelines under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531; see also <i>id.</i>, at 540 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  And in any event, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat is at stake in this case is a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for relief, not the extent of that relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 532 (plurality opinion).  Even if a defendant is eligible for relief, before a district court grants a reduction it must consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe factors set forth in section 3553(a) to the extent that they are applicable\xe2\x80\x9d and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9capplicable policy statements.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).  The district court can consider the benefits the defendant gained by entering a Type-C agreement when it decides whether a reduction is appropriate (or when it determines the extent of any reduction), \xe2\x80\x9cfor the statute permits but does not require the court to reduce a sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 532<i>.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government also contends that allowing courts to reduce the sentences of defendants like Hughes would be inconsistent with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement in USSG \xc2\xa71B1.10, which provides that when a district court modifies a sentence under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) it \xe2\x80\x9cshall substitute only the [retroactive] amendments listed in subsection (d) for the corresponding guidelines provisions that were applied when the defendant was sentenced and shall leave all other guideline application decisions unaffected.\xe2\x80\x9d  USSG \xc2\xa71B1.10(b)(1).  According to the Government, no \xe2\x80\x9cguidelines provisions\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9capplied\xe2\x80\x9d when a defendant enters a Type-C agreement because at the moment of sentencing\xe2\x80\x94that is, after the court has already accepted the agreement\xe2\x80\x94Rule 11 prohibits the court from imposing any sentence other than the one the parties bargained for.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument fails for at least two reasons.  First, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71B1.10 depends on an artificial distinction between a court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to accept a Type-C agreement and its decision to impose the agreed-upon sentence.  As explained above, a district court must consider the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9capplicable Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x9d when it decides whether to accept or reject the agreement, USSG \xc2\xa76B1.2(c)\xe2\x80\x94often, as here, at the sentencing hearing, after the court has reviewed the presentence report.  And as the Government itself points out, once the district court accepts the agreement, the agreed-upon sentence is the only sentence the court may impose.  Thus, there is no meaningful difference between a court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to accept a Type-C agreement that includes a particular sentence and the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision (sometimes, as here, just minutes later) to impose that sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statement \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to isolate whatever marginal effect the since-rejected Guideline had on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 530.  Accordingly, relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) should be available to permit the district court to reconsider a prior sentence to the extent the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range was a relevant part of the framework the judge used to accept the agreement or determine the sentence.  <i>Ibid.</i>  If the district court concludes that it would have imposed the same sentence even if the defendant had been subject to the lower range, then the court retains discretion to deny relief.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In this case the District Court accepted Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 Type-C agreement after concluding that a 180-month sentence was consistent with the Sentencing Guidelines.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a.  The court then calculated Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 sentencing range and imposed a sentence that the court deemed \xe2\x80\x9ccompatible\xe2\x80\x9d with the Guidelines.  <i>Id.,</i> at 36a, 47a.  Thus, the sentencing range was a basis for the sentence that the District Court imposed.  That range has \xe2\x80\x9csubsequently been lowered by the Sentencing Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d so Hughes is eligible for relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).  The Court expresses no view as to whether the District Court should exercise its discretion to reduce Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 sentence after considering the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors and the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s relevant policy statements.

It studiously adheres to \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents since <i>Freeman</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d which firmly establish \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Guidelines remain the foundation of federal sentencing decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d <i> Ante</i>, at 8; see <i>ante, </i>at 12 (discussing <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___; <i>Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530 (2013)).  And it aligns more closely than the dissent does with the view I articulated in <i>Freeman</i>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  For all these reasons, I now lend my vote to the majority and accede in its holding \xe2\x80\x9cthat a sentence imposed pursuant to a Type-C agreement is \xe2\x80\x98based on\xe2\x80\x99 the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines range so long as that range was part of the framework the district court relied on in imposing the sentence or accepting the agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Unlike the majority, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s position is incompatible with my view in <i>Freeman</i> (and in this case)<i> </i>that criminal defendants who plead guilty under Type-C agreements are not categorically ineligible for relief under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2).

Brief for United States 52.  But, as the majority persuasively explains, that argument \xe2\x80\x9chas nothing to do with whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was based on the Sentencing Guidelines under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2)\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore has no bearing on whether a defendant who has entered into a Type-C agreement is eligible for a sentence reduction.  <i>Ante</i>, at 12; see <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 532 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is at stake .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for relief, not the extent of that relief\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).

When a defendant enters into a binding \xe2\x80\x9cType-C\xe2\x80\x9d plea agreement pursuant to Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(c)(1)(C), however, the resulting sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cdictated by the terms of the agreement entered into by the parties, not the judge\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines calculation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 536 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).  Five Justices recognized as much in <i>Freeman</i>. See <i>ibid.</i>; <i>id.,</i> at 544 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If a defendant pleads guilty pursuant to a Type-C agreement specifying a particular term of imprisonment, the district court may sentence him only to that term.

If the judge considers the parties\xe2\x80\x99 chosen sentence to be inappropriate, he does not have discretion to impose a different one.  Instead, the court\xe2\x80\x99s only option is to reject the agreement and afford the defendant the opportunity to be released from his guilty plea.  See Fed. Rules Crim. Proc. 11(c)(3)(A), (4), (5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the Court points out, a district court considering whether to accept a Type-C agreement must consult the Guidelines, as the District Court did here.  <i>Ante,</i> at 5; see App. to Pet. for Cert. 32a\xe2\x80\x9336a.  But \xe2\x80\x9cwhen determining the sentence to impose,\xe2\x80\x9d the district court may base its decision on \xe2\x80\x9cone thing and one thing only\xe2\x80\x94the plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 545 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The Court characterizes this distinction as \xe2\x80\x9cartificial,\xe2\x80\x9d arguing that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate imposition of a sentence often has as much to do with its Guidelines calculation as anything else.  <i>Ante,</i> at 13; see <i>ante, </i>at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But that is not so: With a Type-C agreement, the sentence is set by the parties, not by a judge applying the Guidelines.  Far from being \xe2\x80\x9cartificial,\xe2\x80\x9d that distinction is central to what makes a Type-C plea a Type-C plea.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the (C) agreement context\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe binding plea agreement that is the foundation for the term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freeman</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 535 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).  \xe2\x80\x9cTo hold otherwise would be to contravene the very purpose of (C) agreements\xe2\x80\x94to bind the district court and allow the Government and the defendant to determine what sentence he will receive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 536.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That commonsense understanding accords with our reading of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of deciding when a cause of action is based upon particular conduct.  In <i>Saudi Arabia</i> v. <i>Nelson</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349 (1993), we considered a provision in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 providing an exception to a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s immunity when \xe2\x80\x9cthe action is based upon a commercial activity carried on in the United States by the foreign state.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71605(a)(2).  We said that the phrase did not encompass a foreign state\xe2\x80\x99s activity that \xe2\x80\x9cled to\xe2\x80\x9d the tortious conduct.  507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358.  Instead, we interpreted the phrase to refer only to the conduct that forms \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98basis,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfoundation,\xe2\x80\x9d of the cause of action\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98gravamen of the complaint.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 357.  And as we explained, the \xe2\x80\x9ctorts, and not the arguably commercial activities that preceded their commission, form the basis for the [plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] suit.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 358.  So too here:  The Type-C agreement, and not the Guidelines calculation that preceded its acceptance, forms the basis for the sentence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More recently, in <i>OBB Personenverkehr AG</i> v. <i>Sachs</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015), we found that a cause of action was not \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon\xe2\x80\x9d commercial activity when the activity established just one element of the action.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbased upon,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, instead looks to \xe2\x80\x9cthe core of [the] suit\xe2\x80\x9d and what the claims \xe2\x80\x9cturn on.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938).  Here the sentence that petitioner Hughes received \xe2\x80\x9cturned on\xe2\x80\x9d the agreement, not the Guidelines or anything else.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court finds new justification for its interpretation in <i>Peugh</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530 (2013), and <i>Molina-Martinez</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016).  But those cases\xe2\x80\x94which do not concern the language of \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) or sentencing pursuant to Type-C agreements\xe2\x80\x94do not inform the distinct question at hand.  I agree that when a district court has discretion to select an appropriate sentence, the resulting sentence can often be said to be based on the advisory Guidelines range.  See <i>Peugh</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 541 (describing sentences under the post-<i>Booker </i>scheme as \xe2\x80\x9canchored by the Guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Booker</i>, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220 (2005)); <i>Molina-Martinez</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the ordinary case\xe2\x80\x9d the Guidelines \xe2\x80\x9canchor the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion in selecting an appropriate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).  But there are circumstances where the district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion is confined such that the Guidelines range does not play a meaningful part in the ultimate determination of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence.  One such scenario is when an applicable mandatory minimum supersedes the Guidelines range.  See <i>Koons</i> v. <i>United States</i>, ___ U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 2) (a Guidelines range can be \xe2\x80\x9coverridden\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9ca congressionally mandated minimum sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Another is the situation before us, where Rule 11(c)(1)(C) compels the district court to sentence the defendant to a term chosen by the parties, or none at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, as five Members of this Court recognized in <i>Freeman</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llowing district courts later to reduce a term of imprisonment simply because the court itself considered the Guidelines in deciding whether to accept the agreement would transform \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) into a mechanism by which courts could rewrite the terms of (C) agreements in ways not contemplated by the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 536\xe2\x80\x93537 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.); see <i>id.,</i> at 545 (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).  The Court dismisses this point as having \xe2\x80\x9cnothing to do with whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was based on the Sentencing Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 12.  But of course it does.  The very purpose of a Type-C agreement is to present the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence to the district court on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, preventing the district judge from altering the sentence as he sees fit.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa73582(c)(2) allows for just such revision, possibly many years down the line, when the Government has already fulfilled its side of the bargain.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court justifies this result by arguing that its rule ensures that \xe2\x80\x9cthose who commit crimes of similar severity under similar conditions receive similar sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  But that ignores the crucial way in which Type-C defendants are <i>not </i>similarly situated to other defendants.  They entered into binding agreements\xe2\x80\x94based on the unique facts of their cases and their negotiations with prosecutors\xe2\x80\x94and received benefits (often quite significant ones) that other defendants do not.  The facts of this case provide a striking illustration.  In exchange for the certainty of a binding 180-month sentence, the Government not only dropped additional charges against Hughes, but also promised not to pursue a recidivist enhancement that would have imprisoned him for life.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court stresses that the question presented concerns only a Type-C defendant\xe2\x80\x99s <i>eligibility</i> under \xc2\xa73582(c)(2), and that the district court might exercise its discretion to deny a reduction if it \xe2\x80\x9cconcludes that it would have imposed the same sentence even if the defendant had been subject to the lower range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 14; see <i>ante,</i> at 13 (suggesting that the district court \xe2\x80\x9ccan consider the benefits the defendant gained by entering a Type-C agreement\xe2\x80\x9d in deciding \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a reduction is appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d).  But even if the district court ultimately decides against a reduction, the Government will be forced to litigate the issue in the meantime\xe2\x80\x94nullifying another of its benefits from the Type-C agreement.  To secure the sentence to which the parties already agreed, the Government likely will have to recreate the state of play from the original plea negotiations and sentencing to make counterfactual \xe2\x80\x9cwhat if\xe2\x80\x9d arguments\xe2\x80\x94which, naturally, the defendant will then try to rebut.  Settling this debate is unlikely to be as straightforward as the Court anticipates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The point is a very practical one: Hughes pleaded guilty and entered into a binding agreement because he otherwise was looking at life in prison.  Although the District Court dutifully performed the required Guidelines calculations, Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was based on the agreement, not the Guidelines range.  Hughes should not receive a windfall benefit because that range has been changed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Government may well be able to limit the frustrating effects of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the long run.  Going forward, it presumably can add a provision to every Type-C agreement in which the defendant agrees to waive any right to seek a sentence reduction following future Guidelines amendments.  See Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (referring to the possibility of such an \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit waiver\xe2\x80\x9d).  But that is no comfort when it comes to cases like this one, where the parties understood their choice of sentence to be binding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
