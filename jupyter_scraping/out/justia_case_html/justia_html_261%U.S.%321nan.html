JUSTICE McKENNA delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Action for $600.  Judgment for $260.50.  The case was submitted with <em>United States v.

Had he been so paid, and as required by the Act of May 22, 1917, 40 Stat. 84, he would have received during the entire period from August 1, 1917, when he was placed on active duty, to December 31, 1918, the sum of $1,790.50.  The pay received by him, however, was $1,530, leaving a balance due of $260.50.  For this sum the Court of Claims gave judgment.</p>\n<p>The findings of the court sustain its action, and on the authority of the <em>Allen</em> case, we affirm the judgment.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
