They are also subject to several tiers of appellate review, and thus are part of an integrated \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-martial system\xe2\x80\x9d that resembles civilian structures of justice.  That system begins with the court-martial itself, a tribunal that determines guilt or innocence and levies punishment, up to lifetime imprisonment or execution.  The next phase occurs at one of four appellate courts: the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) for the Army, Navy-Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard.  They review decisions where the sentence is a punitive discharge, incarceration for more than one year, or death.  The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) sits atop the court-martial system.  The CAAF is a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of record\xe2\x80\x9d composed of five civilian judges,\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7941, which must review certain weighty cases and may review others.  Finally,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259 gives this Court jurisdiction to review the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions by writ of certiorari.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioner Keanu Ortiz, an Airman First Class, was convicted by a court-martial of possessing and distributing child pornography, and he was sentenced to two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment and a dishonorable discharge.  An Air Force CCA panel, including Colonel Martin Mitchell, affirmed that decision.  The CAAF then granted Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review to consider whether Judge Mitchell was disqualified from serving on the CCA because he had been appointed to the Court of Military Commission Review (CMCR).  The Secretary of Defense had initially put Judge Mitchell on the CMCR under his statutory authority to \xe2\x80\x9cassign [officers] who are appellate military judges\xe2\x80\x9d to serve on that court.\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2).  To moot a possible constitutional problem with the assignment, the President (with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent) also appointed Judge Mitchell to the CMCR pursuant to \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3).  Shortly thereafter, Judge Mitchell participated in Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s CCA appeal.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Ortiz claimed that Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s CMCR appointment barred his continued CCA service under both a statute and the Constitution.  First, he argued that the appointment violated \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A), which provides that unless \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise authorized by law,\xe2\x80\x9d an active-duty military officer \xe2\x80\x9cmay not hold, or exercise the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the federal government.  Second, he argued that the Appointments Clause prohibits simultaneous service on the CMCR and the CCA.  The CAAF rejected both grounds for ordering another appeal.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0This Court has jurisdiction to review the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  The judicial character and constitutional pedigree of the court-martial system enable this Court, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, to review the decisions of the court sitting at its apex.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">An <i>amicus curiae</i>, Professor Aditya Bamzai, argues that cases decided by the CAAF do not fall within Article III\xe2\x80\x99s grant of appellate jurisdiction to this Court.  In <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, Chief Justice Marshall explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthat it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 175.  Here, Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition asks the Court to \xe2\x80\x9crevise and correct\xe2\x80\x9d the latest decision in a \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d that began in and progressed through military justice \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unless Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s test implicitly exempts cases instituted in a military court, the case is now appellate.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">There is no reason to make that distinction.  The military justice system\xe2\x80\x99s essential character is judicial.  Military courts decide cases in strict accordance with a body of federal law and afford virtually the same procedural protections to service members as those given in a civilian criminal proceeding.  The judgments a military tribunal renders \xe2\x80\x9crest on the same basis, and are surrounded by the same considerations[, as] give conclusiveness to the judgments of other legal tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Reed</i>,\n\n100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, 23.  Accordingly, such judgments have res judicata and Double Jeopardy effect.  The jurisdiction and structure of the court-martial system likewise resemble those of other courts whose decisions this Court reviews.  Courts-martial try service members for garden-variety crimes unrelated to military service, and can impose terms of imprisonment and capital punishment.  Their decisions are also subject to an appellate process similar to the one found in most States.  And just as important, the constitutional foundation of courts-martial is not in the least insecure.  See <i>Dynes</i> v. <i>Hoover</i>, 20 How. 65, 79.  The court-martial is older than the Constitution, was recognized and sanctioned by the Framers, and has been authorized here since the first Congress.  Throughout that history, courts-martial have operated as instruments of military justice, not mere military command.  They are bound, like any court, by the fundamental principles of law and the duty to adjudicate cases without partiality.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Bamzai argues that the Court lacks jurisdiction because the CAAF is not an Article III court, but is instead in the Executive Branch.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction, however, covers more than the decisions of Article III courts.  This Court can review proceedings of state courts.  See <i>Martin </i>v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304.  It can also review certain non-Article III judicial systems created by Congress.  In particular, the Court has upheld its exercise of appellate jurisdiction over decisions of non-Article III territorial courts, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coe</i>,\n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 76, and it has uncontroversially exercised appellate jurisdiction over non-Article III District of Columbia courts, see <i>Palmore</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 389.  The non-Article III court-martial system stands on much the same footing as territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts.  All three rest on an expansive constitutional delegation, have deep historical roots, and perform an inherently judicial role.  Thus, in <i>Palmore</i>, this Court viewed the military, territories, and District as \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized areas having particularized needs\xe2\x80\x9d in which Article III \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s] way to accommodate plenary grants of power to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 408.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Bamzai does not provide a sufficient reason to divorce military courts from territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts when it comes to defining this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction.  He first relies on the fact that territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts exercise power over discrete geographic areas, while military courts do not.  But this distinction does not matter to the jurisdictional inquiry.  His second argument focuses on the fact that the CAAF is in the Executive Branch.  In his view, two of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents\xe2\x80\x94<i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Vallandigham</i>, 1 Wall. 243, and <i>Marbury</i>, 1 Cranch 137\xe2\x80\x94show that the Court may never accept appellate jurisdiction from any person or body within that branch.  As to <i>Vallandigham</i>, that case goes to show only that not every military tribunal is alike.  Unlike the military commission in <i>Vallandigham</i>, which lacked \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Wall., at 253, the CAAF is a permanent court of record established by Congress, and its decisions are final unless the Court reviews and reverses them.  As to <i>Marbury</i>, James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s failure to transmit William Marbury\xe2\x80\x99s commission was not a judicial decision by a court.  Here, by contrast, three constitutionally rooted courts rendered inherently judicial decisions.<i> </i> Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on the CCA and the CMCR violated neither \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A) nor the Appointments Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The statutory issue turns on two interlocking provisions.  Section 973(b)(2)(A) is the statute that Ortiz claims was violated here.  It prohibits military officers from \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing], or exercis[ing] the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the federal government, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise authorized by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 950f(b) is the statute that the Government claims \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise authorize[s]\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s CMCR service, even if a seat on that court is a covered \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office.\xe2\x80\x9d  It provides two ways to become a CMCR judge.  Under \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2), the Secretary of Defense \xe2\x80\x9cmay assign\xe2\x80\x9d qualified officers serving on a CCA to be judges on the CMCR.  Under \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3), the President (with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent) \xe2\x80\x9cmay appoint\xe2\x80\x9d persons\xe2\x80\x94whether officers or civilians is unspecified\xe2\x80\x94to CMCR judgeships.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Ortiz argues that Judge Mitchell was not \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized by law\xe2\x80\x9d to serve on the CMCR after his appointment because \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3) makes no express reference to military officers.  In the circumstances here, however, the express authorization to assign military officers to the CMCR under \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2) was the only thing necessary to exempt Judge Mitchell from \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A).  Once the Secretary of Defense placed Judge Mitchell on the CMCR pursuant to \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2), the President\xe2\x80\x99s later appointment made no difference.  It did not negate the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s earlier action, but rather ratified what the Secretary had already done.  Thus, after the appointment, Judge Mitchell served on the CMCR by virtue of both the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s assignment and the President\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.  And because \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2) expressly authorized the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s assignment, Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s CMCR service could not run afoul of \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Ortiz also raises an Appointments Clause challenge to Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on the CCA and the CMCR.  That Clause distinguishes between principal officers and inferior officers.  CCA judges are inferior officers.  Ortiz views CMCR judges as principal officers.  And Ortiz argues that, under the Appointments Clause, a single judge cannot serve as an inferior officer on one court and a principal officer on another.  But the Court has never read the Appointments Clause to impose rules about dual service, separate and distinct from methods of appointment.  And if the Court were ever to apply the Clause to dual-officeholding, it would not start here.  Ortiz does not show how Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s CMCR service would result in \xe2\x80\x9cundue influence\xe2\x80\x9d on his CCA colleagues.

The petitioner, an airman convicted of crimes in the military justice system, contends that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s holding of dual offices violated a statute regulating military service, as well as the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Appointments Clause.  The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) rejected those claims, and we granted a petition for certiorari.  We hold first that this Court has jurisdiction to review decisions of the CAAF, even though it is not an Article III court.  We then affirm the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s determination that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service was lawful.</p><p>I</p><p>In the exercise of its authority over the armed forces, Congress has long provided for specialized military courts to adjudicate charges against service members.  Today, trial-level courts-martial hear cases involving a wide range of offenses, including crimes unconnected with military service; as a result, the jurisdiction of those tribunals overlaps substantially with that of state and federal courts.  See <i>Solorio</i> v. <i>United States</i>,483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 435, 436 (1987); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Kebodeaux</i>,570 U.\xc2\xa0S. 387, 404 (2013) (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  And courts-martial are now subject to several tiers of appellate review, thus forming part of an integrated \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-martial system\xe2\x80\x9d that closely resembles civilian structures of justice.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Denedo</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 904, 920 (2009); see <i>Weiss</i> v. <i>United States</i>,510 U.\xc2\xa0S. 163, 174 (1994).</p><p>That system begins with the court-martial itself, an officer-led tribunal convened to determine guilt or innocence and levy appropriate punishment, up to lifetime imprisonment or execution.  See 10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7816, 818, 856a.  The next phase of military justice occurs at one of four appellate courts: the Court of Criminal Appeals (CCA) for the Army, Navy-Marine Corps, Air Force, or Coast Guard.  Those courts, using three-judge panels of either officers or civilians, review all decisions in which the sentence imposed involves a punitive discharge, incarceration for more than one year, or death.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7866(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  Atop the court-martial system is the CAAF, a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of record\xe2\x80\x9d made up of five civilian judges appointed to serve 15-year terms.  \xc2\xa7941; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7942(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  The CAAF must review certain weighty cases (including those in which capital punishment was imposed), and may grant petitions for review in any others.  See \xc2\xa7867.  Finally, this Court possesses statutory authority to step in afterward: Under28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259, we have jurisdiction to review the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions by writ of certiorari.</p><p>Petitioner Keanu Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s case has run the gamut of this legal system.  Ortiz, an Airman First Class in the Air Force, was charged with knowingly possessing and distributing child pornography, in violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice.  A court-martial found Ortiz guilty as charged and imposed a sentence of two years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment and a dishonorable discharge.  On appeal, an Air Force CCA panel, including Colonel Martin Mitchell, summarily affirmed the court-martial\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  The CAAF then granted Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review to consider whether Judge Mitchell was disqualified from serving on the CCA, thus entitling Ortiz to an appellate do-over.</p><p>That issue arose from Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on the CMCR.  Congress created the CMCR as an appellate tribunal to review the decisions of military commissions, particularly those operating in Guantanamo Bay.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  The Secretary of Defense put Judge Mitchell on that court shortly after he became a member of the CCA, under a statutory provision authorizing the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cassign [officers] who are appellate military judges\xe2\x80\x9d to serve on the CMCR as well.10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2).  Around the same time, a military-commission defendant argued to the Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit that the Appointments Clause requires the President and Senate (rather than the Secretary) to place judges on the CMCR.  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit avoided resolving that issue, but suggested that the President and Senate could \xe2\x80\x9cput [it] to rest\xe2\x80\x9d by appointing the very CMCR judges whom the Secretary had previously assigned.  <i>In re al-Nashiri</i>, 791 F. 3d 71, 86 (2015).  The President decided to take that advice, and nominated each of those judges\xe2\x80\x94Mitchell, among them\xe2\x80\x94under an adjacent statutory provision authorizing him to \xe2\x80\x9cappoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate,\xe2\x80\x9d CMCR judges.  \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3).  The Senate then confirmed those nominations.  About a month later, Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x94now wearing his CCA robe\xe2\x80\x94participated in the panel decision rejecting Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.</p><p>In Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s view, Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s appointment to the CMCR barred his continued service on the CCA under both a statute and the Constitution.  First, Ortiz invoked10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7973(b).  That statute, designed to ensure civilian preeminence in government, provides that unless \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise authorized by law,\xe2\x80\x9d an active-duty military officer like Judge Mitchell \xe2\x80\x9cmay not hold, or exercise the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the Federal Government.  \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A).  According to Ortiz, a CMCR judgeship is a covered civil office, and no other law allowed the President to put Mitchell in that position: Thus, his appointment to the CMCR violated \xc2\xa7973(b).  See Brief in Support of Petition Granted in No. 16\xe2\x80\x930671 (CAAF), pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9322.  And the proper remedy, Ortiz argued, was to terminate Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s military service effective the date of his CMCR appointment and void all his later actions as a CCA judge\xe2\x80\x94including his decision on Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  See <i>ibid.</i>  Second and independently, Ortiz relied on the Appointments Clause to challenge Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s dual service.  See <i>id.,</i> at 27\xe2\x80\x9340.  The premise of his argument was that CMCR judges are \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal officers\xe2\x80\x9d under that Clause, whereas CCA judges (as this Court has held) are \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Edmond</i> v. <i>United States</i>,520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651, 666 (1997).  Ortiz claimed that the Appointments Clause prohibits someone serving as a principal officer on one court (the CMCR) from sitting alongside inferior officers on another court (the CCA).  Because Judge Mitchell had done just that, Ortiz concluded, the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on his appeal could not stand.</p><p>The CAAF rejected both grounds for ordering another appeal.  See 76 M. J. 189 (2017).  In considering the statutory question, the court chose not to decide whether \xc2\xa7973(b) precluded Judge Mitchell from serving on the CMCR while an active-duty officer.  Even if so, the CAAF held, the remedy for the violation would not involve terminating the judge\xe2\x80\x99s military service or voiding actions he took on the CCA.  See <i>id.,</i> at 192.  Turning next to the constitutional issue, the CAAF \xe2\x80\x9cs[aw] no Appointments Clause problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 193.  Even assuming Judge Mitchell was a principal officer when sitting on the CMCR, the court held, that status in no way affected his service on the CCA: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Colonel Mitchell sits as a CCA  judge, he is no different from any other CCA judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>The CAAF thus upheld the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.</p><p>This Court granted Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari to consider whether either \xc2\xa7973(b) or the Appointments Clause prevents a military officer from serving, as Judge Mitchell did, on both a CCA and the CMCR.  582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).  We now affirm the decision below.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>II</p><p>We begin with a question of our own jurisdiction to review the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  Congress has explicitly authorized us to undertake such review in28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259.  See <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cDecisions of the [CAAF] may be reviewed by the Supreme Court by writ of certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both the Federal Government and Ortiz view that grant of jurisdiction as constitutionally proper.  But an <i>amicus curiae</i>, Professor Aditya Bamzai, argues that it goes beyond what Article III allows.  That position is a new one to this Court: We have previously reviewed nine CAAF decisions without anyone objecting that we lacked the power to do so.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  Still, we think the argument is serious, and deserving of sustained consideration.  That analysis leads us to conclude that the judicial character and constitutional pedigree of the court-martial system enable this Court, in exercising appellate jurisdiction, to review the decisions of the court sitting at its apex.</p><p>Bamzai starts with a proposition no one can contest\xe2\x80\x94that our review of CAAF decisions cannot rest on our <i>original </i>jurisdiction.  Brief for Aditya Bamzai as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 11.  Article III of the Constitution grants this Court original jurisdiction in a limited category of cases: those \xe2\x80\x9caffecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  That list, of course, does not embrace Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s case, or any other that the CAAF considers.  And ever since <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), this Court has recognized that our original jurisdiction cannot extend any further than the cases enumerated: If Congress attempts to confer more on us, we must (as Chief Justice Marshall famously did, in the pioneer act of judicial review) strike down the law.  <i>Id.,</i> at 174\xe2\x80\x93180.  As a result, Bamzai is right to insist that \xc2\xa71259 could not authorize this Court, as part of its original jurisdiction, to hear military cases like Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s.</p><p>The real issue is whether our <i>appellate </i>jurisdiction can cover such cases.  Article III\xe2\x80\x99s sole reference to appellate jurisdiction provides no apparent barrier, but also no substantial guidance: Following its specification of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction, Article III says only that in all \xe2\x80\x9cother Cases\xe2\x80\x9d that the Constitution comprehends (including cases, like this one, involving federal questions), \xe2\x80\x9cthe supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and Fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to say anything more about appellate jurisdiction leads Bamzai to focus on Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <i>Marbury</i>.  See Brief for Bamzai 2\xe2\x80\x934, 12\xe2\x80\x9314.  In that case (as you surely recall), William Marbury petitioned this Court\xe2\x80\x94without first asking any other\xe2\x80\x94to issue a writ of mandamus to Secretary of State James Madison directing him to deliver a commission.  After holding (as just related) that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction did not extend so far, Chief Justice Marshall also rejected the idea that the Court could provide the writ in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d the Chief Justice explained, is \xe2\x80\x9cthat it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Cranch, at 175.  Marbury\xe2\x80\x99s petition, Chief Justice Marshall held, commenced the cause\xe2\x80\x94or, to use the more modern word, the case; hence, it was not a matter for appellate jurisdiction.  Bamzai contends that the same is true of Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition.</p><p>On any ordinary understanding of the great Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s words, that is a surprising claim.  Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition asks us to \xe2\x80\x9crevise and correct\xe2\x80\x9d the latest decision in a \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d that began in and progressed through military justice \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Or, as the Government puts the point, this case fits within Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s standard because \xe2\x80\x9cit comes to th[is] Court on review of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\xe2\x80\x99 decision, which reviewed a criminal proceeding that originated in [a] court[\xc2\xa0]-martial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  So this Court would hardly be the first to render a decision in the case.  Unless Chief Justice Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s test implicitly exempts cases instituted in a military court\xe2\x80\x94as contrasted, for example, with an ordinary federal court\xe2\x80\x94the case is now appellate.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p>The military justice system\xe2\x80\x99s essential character\xe2\x80\x94in a word, judicial\xe2\x80\x94provides no reason to make that distinction.  Accord <i>post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x938 (Thomas, J., concurring).  Each level of military court decides criminal \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is generally understood, and does so in strict accordance with a body of federal law (of course including the Constitution).  The procedural protections afforded to a service member are \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually the same\xe2\x80\x9d as those given in a civilian criminal proceeding, whether state or federal.  1 D. Schlueter, Military Criminal Justice: Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x937, p. 50 (9th ed. 2015) (Schlueter).  And the judgments a military tribunal renders, as this Court long ago observed, \xe2\x80\x9crest on the same basis, and are surrounded by the same considerations[, as] give conclusiveness to the judgments of other legal tribunals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Reed</i>,100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, 23 (1879).  Accordingly, we have held that the \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, final judgments of military courts, like those of any court of competent jurisdiction[,] have res judicata effect and preclude further litigation of the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Schlesinger</i> v. <i>Councilman</i>,420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 738, 746 (1975).  In particular, those judgments have identical effect under the Double Jeopardy Clause.  See <i>Grafton</i> v. <i>United States</i>,206 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333, 345 (1907).</p><p>The jurisdiction and structure of the court-martial system likewise resemble those of other courts whose decisions we review.  Although their jurisdiction has waxed and waned over time, courts-martial today can try service members for a vast swath of offenses, including garden-variety crimes unrelated to military service.  See 10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7877\xe2\x80\x93934; <i>Solorio</i>, 483 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 438\xe2\x80\x93441; <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  As a result, the jurisdiction of those tribunals overlaps significantly with the criminal jurisdiction of federal and state courts.  See <i>Kebodeaux</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  The sentences meted out are also similar: Courts-martial can impose, on top of peculiarly military discipline, terms of imprisonment and capital punishment.  See \xc2\xa7818(a); <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at 6 (Thomas, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]hese courts decide questions of the most momentous description, affecting even life itself\xe2\x80\x9d (quotation marks and ellipses omitted)).  And the decisions of those tribunals are subject to an appellate process\xe2\x80\x94what we have called an \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated system of military courts and review procedures\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that replicates the judicial apparatus found in most States.  <i>Councilman</i>, 420 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 758.  By the time a case like Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s arrives on our doorstep under28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259, it has passed through not one or two but three military courts (including two that can have civilian judges).</p><p>And just as important, the constitutional foundation of courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94as judicial bodies responsible for \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial and punishment\xe2\x80\x9d of service members\xe2\x80\x94is not in the least insecure.  <i>Dynes</i> v. <i>Hoover</i>, 20 How. 65, 79 (1858).  The court-martial is in fact \xe2\x80\x9colder than the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Schlueter \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x936(B), at 39; the Federalist Papers discuss \xe2\x80\x9ctrials by courts-martial\xe2\x80\x9d under the Articles of Confederation, see No. 40, p. 250 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961).  When it came time to draft a new charter, the Framers \xe2\x80\x9crecogni[zed] and sanction[ed] existing military jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 48 (2d ed. 1920) (emphasis deleted), by exempting from the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Grand Jury Clause all \xe2\x80\x9ccases arising in the land or naval forces.\xe2\x80\x9d  And by granting legislative power \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces,\xe2\x80\x9d the Framers also authorized Congress to carry forward courts-martial.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 14.  Congress did not need to be told twice.  The very first Congress continued the court-martial system as it then operated.  See Winthrop, <i>supra, </i>at 47.  And from that day to this one, Congress has maintained courts-martial in all their essentials to resolve criminal charges against service members.  See 1 Schlueter \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x936, at 35\xe2\x80\x9348.</p><p>Throughout that history, and reflecting the attributes described above, courts-martial have operated as instruments of military justice, not (as the dissent would have it) mere \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary command,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 18 (opinion of Alito, J.).  As one scholar has noted, courts-martial \xe2\x80\x9chave long been understood to exercise \xe2\x80\x98judicial\xe2\x80\x99 power,\xe2\x80\x9d of the same kind wielded by civilian courts.  Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L. Rev. 559, 576 (2007); see W.

Attorney General Bates, even in the middle of the Civil War, characterized a court-martial \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding, from its inception, [a]s judicial,\xe2\x80\x9d because the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial, finding, and sentence are the solemn acts of a court organized and conducted under the authority of and according to the prescribed forms of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Runkle</i> v. <i>United States</i>,122 U.\xc2\xa0S. 543, 558 (1887) (quoting 11 Op.

Brief for Bamzai 3.  He begins, much as we did above, by explaining that under <i>Marbury </i>the Court can exercise appellate jurisdiction only when it is \xe2\x80\x9csupervising an earlier decision by a lower court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Bamzai 13.  The next step is where the argument gets interesting.  The CAAF, Bamzai contends, simply does not qualify as such a body (nor does any other military tribunal).  True enough, \xe2\x80\x9cthe CAAF is called a \xe2\x80\x98court\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and true enough, it decides cases, just as other courts do.  <i>Id.,</i> at 3; see <i>id.</i>, at 28.  But the CAAF, Bamzai notes, is \xe2\x80\x9cnot an <i>Article III</i> court,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 3 (emphasis added): As all agree, its members lack the tenure and salary protections that are the hallmarks of the Article III judiciary, see 10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7942(b), (c).  Congress established the CAAF under its Article I, rather than its Article III, powers, and Congress located the CAAF (as we have previously observed) within the Executive Branch, rather than the judicial one.  See \xc2\xa7941; <i>Edmond</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664, and n. 2.  Those facts, in Bamzai\xe2\x80\x99s view, prevent this Court from exercising appellate jurisdiction over the CAAF.  \xe2\x80\x9cFor constitutional purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d Bamzai concludes, the members of the CAAF \xe2\x80\x9cstand on equal footing with James Madison in <i>Marbury</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Bamzai 4.  (With variations here and there, the dissent makes the same basic argument.)</p><p>But this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction, as Justice Story made clear ages ago, covers more than the decisions of Article III courts.  In <i>Martin </i>v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304 (1816), we considered whether our appellate jurisdiction extends to the proceedings of state courts, in addition to those of the Article III federal judiciary.  We said yes, as long as the case involves subject matter suitable for our review.  <i>Id.,</i> at 338\xe2\x80\x93352.  For our \xe2\x80\x9cappellate power,\xe2\x80\x9d Story wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cis not limited by the terms of [Article III] to any particular courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 338.  Or again: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t will be in vain to search in the letter of the [C]onstitution for any qualification as to the tribunal\xe2\x80\x9d from which a given case comes.  <i>Ibid. </i> The decisions we review might come from Article III courts, but they need not.</p><p>The same lesson emerges from two contexts yet more closely resembling this one\xe2\x80\x94each involving a non-Article III judicial system created by Congress.  First, in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coe</i>,155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 76 (1894), this Court upheld the exercise of appellate jurisdiction over decisions of federal territorial courts, despite their lack of Article III status.  We observed there that the Constitution grants Congress broad authority over the territories: to \xe2\x80\x9cmake all needful Rules and Regulations respecting\xe2\x80\x9d those areas.  Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02; see <i>Coe</i>, 155 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85.  And we recognized that Congress, with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s permission, had long used that power to create territorial courts that did not comply with Article III.  See <i>ibid.  </i>Chief Justice Marshall had held such a court constitutional in 1828 even though its authority was \xe2\x80\x9cnot a part of that judicial power which is defined in the 3d article.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>356 Bales of Cotton</i>, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828); see <i>Coe</i>, 155 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 85 (describing that opinion as having \xe2\x80\x9csettled\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not exhaust the power of Congress to establish courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  The exception to Article III for territorial courts was thus an established and prominent part of the legal landscape by the time <i>Coe</i> addressed this Court\xe2\x80\x99s role in reviewing their decisions.  And so the Court found the issue simple.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere has never been any question,\xe2\x80\x9d we declared, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the judicial action of [territorial courts] may, in accordance with the Constitution, be subjected to [our] appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 86.</p><p>Second, we have routinely, and uncontroversially, exercised appellate jurisdiction over cases adjudicated in the non-Article III District of\xc2\xa0Columbia courts.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  Here too, the Constitution grants Congress an unqualified power: to legislate for the District \xe2\x80\x9cin all Cases whatsoever.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 17.  Under that provision, we long ago determined, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has the entire control over the [D]istrict for every purpose of government,\xe2\x80\x9d including that of \xe2\x80\x9corganizing a judicial department.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kendall</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stokes</i>, 12 Pet. 524, 619 (1838).  So when Congress invoked that authority to create a set of local courts, this Court upheld the legislation\xe2\x80\x94even though the judges on those courts lacked Article III protections.  See <i>Palmore</i> v. <i>United States</i>,411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 389, 407\xe2\x80\x93410 (1973).  We relied on the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cplenary grant[\xc2\xa0] of power to Congress to legislate with respect to\xe2\x80\x9d the national capital.  <i>Id.,</i> at 408.  And several years later, we referred as well to the \xe2\x80\x9chistorical consensus\xe2\x80\x9d supporting congressional latitude over the District\xe2\x80\x99s judiciary.  <i>Northern Pipeline Constr. Co.</i> v. <i>Marathon Pipe Line Co.</i>,458 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50, 70 (1982) (plurality opinion); see <i>id.,</i> at 65, n.\xc2\xa016.  To be sure, we have never explicitly held, as we did in the territorial context, that those same considerations support our appellate jurisdiction over cases resolved in the D.\xc2\xa0C. courts.  But some things go unsaid because they are self-evident.  And indeed, even Bamzai readily acknowledges that this Court can review decisions of the D.\xc2\xa0C. Court of Appeals.  See Brief for Bamzai 23, 25.</p><p>The non-Article III court-martial system stands on much the same footing as territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts, as we have often noted.  The former, just like the latter, rests on an expansive constitutional delegation: As this Court early held, Article I gives Congress the power\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9centirely independent\xe2\x80\x9d of Article III\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto provide for the trial and punishment of military and naval offences in the manner then and now practiced by civilized nations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Dynes</i>, 20 How., at 79; see <i>supra,</i> at 9.  The former has, if anything, deeper historical roots, stretching from before this nation\xe2\x80\x99s beginnings up to the present.  See <i>supra,</i> at 9.  And the former, no less than the others, performs an inherently judicial role, as to substantially similar cases.  See <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  So it is not surprising that we have lumped the three together.  In <i>Palmore</i>, the Court viewed the military, territories, and District as a triad of \xe2\x80\x9cspecialized areas having particularized needs\xe2\x80\x9d in which Article III \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s] way to accommodate plenary grants of power to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  411 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 408.  And in <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, the plurality said of all three that \xe2\x80\x9ca constitutional grant of power [as] historically understood\xe2\x80\x9d has bestowed \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional powers\xe2\x80\x9d on Congress to create courts outside Article III.  458 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 66, 70.[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  Given those well-understood connections, we would need a powerful reason to divorce military courts from territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts when it comes to defining our appellate jurisdiction.</p><p>And Bamzai fails to deliver one.  His initial attempt relies on a simple fact about territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts: They exercise power over \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete geographic areas.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Bamzai 23.  Military courts do not; they instead exercise power over discrete individuals\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, members of the armed forces.  So Bamzai gives us a distinction: places vs. people.  What he does not offer is a good reason why that distinction should matter in our jurisdictional inquiry\xe2\x80\x94why it is one of substance, rather than convenience.  He mentions that the territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts are \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional equivalents of state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 24; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35.  But for starters, that could be said of courts-martial too.  As we have described, they try all the \xe2\x80\x9cordinary criminal offenses\xe2\x80\x9d (murder, assault, robbery, drug crimes, etc., etc., etc.) that state courts do.  <i>Kebo- deaux</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); see <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 9.  And more fundamentally, we do not see why geographical <i>state</i>-likeness, rather than historical <i>court</i>-likeness, should dispose of the issue.  As we have shown, the petition here asks us to \xe2\x80\x9crevise[\xc2\xa0] and correct[\xc2\xa0] the proceedings in a cause already instituted\xe2\x80\x9d in a judicial system recognized since the founding as competent to render the most serious decisions.  <i>Marbury</i>, 1 Cranch, at 175; see <i>supra,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  That should make the case an appeal, whether or not the domain that system covers is precisely analogous to, say, Alabama.</p><p>So Bamzai tries another route to cleave off military courts, this time focusing on their location in the Executive Branch.  See Brief for Bamzai 26\xe2\x80\x9330.  Bamzai actually never says in what branch (if any) he thinks territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. courts reside.  But he knows\xe2\x80\x94because this Court has said\xe2\x80\x94that the CAAF is an \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive Branch entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Edmond</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 664, and n.\xc2\xa02; see <i>supra,</i> at 12.  And in Bamzai\xe2\x80\x99s view, two of our precedents show that we may never accept appellate jurisdiction from any person or body within that branch.  See Brief for Bamzai 2\xe2\x80\x934.  The first case he cites is <i>Ex parte Vallandigham</i>, 1 Wall. 243 (1864), in which the Court held that it lacked jurisdiction over decisions of a temporary Civil War-era military commission.  See <i>id</i>., at 251\xe2\x80\x93252.  The second is <i>Marbury</i> itself, in which the Court held (as if this needed repeating) that it lacked jurisdiction to review James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to deliver a commission appointing William Marbury a justice of the peace.  See 1 Cranch, at 175\xe2\x80\x93176; <i>supra,</i> at 7.</p><p>As to the first, <i>Vallandigham </i>goes to show only that not every military tribunal is alike.  The commission the Court considered there was established by General Ambrose Burnside (he of the notorious facial hair) for a time-limited, specialized purpose\xe2\x80\x94to try persons within the military Department of Ohio (Burnside\xe2\x80\x99s then-command) for aiding the Confederacy.  See 1 Wall., at 243\xe2\x80\x93244.  And the General kept firm control of the commission (made up entirely of his own field officers): After personally ordering Vallandigham\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, he (and he alone) also reviewed the commission\xe2\x80\x99s findings and sentence.  See <i>id.,</i> at 247\xe2\x80\x93248; J. McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom 596\xe2\x80\x93597 (1988).  This Court therefore found that the commission lacked \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Wall., at 253.  It was more an adjunct to a general than a real court\xe2\x80\x94and so we did not have appellate jurisdiction over its decisions.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]  But the very thing that Burnside\xe2\x80\x99s commission lacked, the court-martial system\xe2\x80\x94and, in particular, the CAAF (whose decision Ortiz asks us to review)\xe2\x80\x94possesses in spades.  Once again, the CAAF is a permanent \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of record\xe2\x80\x9d created by Congress; it stands at the acme of a firmly entrenched judicial system that exercises broad jurisdiction in accordance with established rules and procedures; and its own decisions are final (except if we review and reverse them).  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, 8\xe2\x80\x9311.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]  That is \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>more than sufficient to separate the CAAF from Burnside\xe2\x80\x99s commission, and align it instead with territorial and D.\xc2\xa0C. (and also state and federal) courts of appeals.</p><p>And the differences between the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions and James Madison\xe2\x80\x99s delivery refusal should have already leaped off the page.  To state the obvious: James Madison was not a court, either in name or in function.  He was the Secretary of State\xe2\x80\x94the head of a cabinet department (and, by the way, the right arm of the President).  Likewise, Madison\xe2\x80\x99s failure to transmit Marbury\xe2\x80\x99s commission was not a judicial decision; it was an enforcement action (though in the form of non-action), pertaining only to the execution of law.  As Chief Justice Marshall saw, Secretary Madison merely triggered the case of <i>Marbury </i>v. <i>Madison</i>; he did not hear and resolve it, as a judicial body would have done.  See 1 Cranch, at 175.  The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s opinion thus cleanly divides that case from this one, even if both (as Bamzai notes) formally involve executive officers.  Here, three constitutionally rooted courts, ending with the CAAF, rendered inherently judicial decisions\xe2\x80\x94just as such tribunals have done since our nation\xe2\x80\x99s founding.  In reviewing, \xe2\x80\x9crevis[ing,] and correct[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d those proceedings, as Ortiz asks, we do nothing more or different than in generally exercising our appellate jurisdiction.  <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>But finally, in holding that much, we say nothing about whether we could exercise appellate jurisdiction over cases from other adjudicative bodies in the Executive Branch, including those in administrative agencies.  Our resolution of the jurisdictional issue here has rested on the judicial character, as well as the constitutional foundations and history, of the court-martial system.  We have relied, too, on the connections that our cases have long drawn between that judicial system and those of the territories and the District.  If Congress were to grant us appellate jurisdiction over decisions of newer entities advancing an administrative (rather than judicial) mission, the question would be different\xe2\x80\x94and the answer not found in this opinion.</p><p>III</p><p>We may now turn to the issues we took this case to decide.  Recall that Ortiz seeks a new appeal proceeding before the Air Force CCA, based on Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s participation in his last one.  See <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s challenge turns on Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on another court, the CMCR.  Originally, the Secretary of Defense had assigned Judge Mitchell to sit on that court.  Then, to moot a possible constitutional problem with Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s CMCR service, the President (with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent) appointed Judge Mitchell as well.  A short time later, Judge Mitchell ruled on Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s CCA appeal.  Ortiz contends that doing so violated both a federal statute and the Appointments Clause.  We dis- agree on both counts.</p><p>A</p><p>The statutory issue respecting Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s dual service turns on two interlocking provisions.  The first is \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x94the statute Ortiz claims was violated here.  As noted earlier, that law\xe2\x80\x94in the interest of ensuring civilian preeminence in government\xe2\x80\x94prohibits active-duty military officers like Judge Mitchell from \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing], or exercis[ing] the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d certain \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office[s]\xe2\x80\x9d in the Federal Government, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as otherwise authorized by law.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  The second is \xc2\xa7950f(b)\xe2\x80\x94a statute the Government claims \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise authorize[s]\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s service on the CMCR, even if a seat on that court is a covered \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office.\xe2\x80\x9d  As also noted above, \xc2\xa7950f(b) provides two ways to become a CMCR judge.  See <i>supra</i>, at 3.  Under \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2), the Secretary of Defense \xe2\x80\x9cmay assign\xe2\x80\x9d qualified officers serving on a CCA to \xe2\x80\x9cbe judges on the [CMCR]\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  And under \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3), the President (with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent) \xe2\x80\x9cmay appoint\xe2\x80\x9d persons\xe2\x80\x94whether officers or civilians is unspecified\xe2\x80\x94to CMCR judgeships.</p><p>Against that statutory backdrop, Ortiz claims that Judge Mitchell became disqualified from serving on the CCA the moment his presidential<i> </i>appointment to the CMCR became final.  See Brief for Petitioners 39\xe2\x80\x9342.  Notably, Ortiz has no statutory objection to Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on those courts before that date\xe2\x80\x94when he sat on the CMCR solely by virtue of the Secretary of Defense\xe2\x80\x99s assignment.  See <i>id.,</i> at 40.  Nor could he reasonably lodge such a complaint, for \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2), in no uncertain terms, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise authorize[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary to place a military judge on the CMCR\xe2\x80\x94thus exempting such an officer from \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.  But in Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s view, the provision in \xc2\xa7950f(b)(3) for presidential appointments contains no similar authorization, because it makes no \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[\xc2\xa0] or unambiguous[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d reference to military officers.  <i>Id</i>., at 20.  And so, Ortiz concludes, \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule must govern.</p><p>In the circumstances here, however, the authorization in \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2) was the only thing necessary to exempt Judge Mitchell from the civil office-holding ban\xe2\x80\x94not just before but also after his presidential appointment.  That provision, as just noted, unambiguously permitted the Secretary of Defense to place Judge Mitchell on the CMCR, even if such a judgeship is a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil office.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>supra,</i> at 20.  And once that happened, the President\xe2\x80\x99s later appointment of Judge Mitchell made not a whit of difference.  Nothing in \xc2\xa7950f (or any other law) suggests that the President\xe2\x80\x99s appointment erased or otherwise negated the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s earlier action.  To the contrary, that appointment (made for purposes of protecting against a constitutional challenge, see <i>supra,</i> at 3) merely ratified what the Secretary had already done.  The nomination papers that the President submitted to the Senate reflect that fact.  They sought confirmation of Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as a CMCR judge \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n accordance with [his] continued status as [a CMCR] judge pursuant to [his] assignment by the Secretary of Defense[,] under 10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. Section 950f(b)(2).\xe2\x80\x9d  162 Cong. Rec. S1474 (Mar. 14, 2016).  So after the Senate approved the nomination, Judge Mitchell served on the CMCR by virtue of <i>both</i> the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s assignment and the President\xe2\x80\x99s appointment.  And because \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2) expressly authorized the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s assignment, Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s service on the CMCR could not run afoul of \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s general rule.[<a href="#F10">10</a>]</p><p>Ortiz argues in response that the President\xe2\x80\x99s appointment demanded its own clear authorization because only that appointment put Judge Mitchell into a \xe2\x80\x9cnew office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 7.  According to Ortiz, an officer who receives a secretarial assignment to the CMCR \xe2\x80\x9cexercise[s] additional duties\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but he does not hold a second position.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 13.  A presidential appointment alone, he says, effects that more dramatic change.  And Ortiz contends that \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s rule cares about that difference.  That law, Ortiz says, requires a legislative authorization when, and only when, a service member receives a whole new office\xe2\x80\x94which is to say here when, and only when, the President appoints a judge to the CMCR.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935 (stating that \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A) \xe2\x80\x9cprohibit[s] military officers from holding [civil offices] absent express con- gressional authorization, while generally allowing mili- tary officers to be assigned to exercise the duties of such positions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>But that argument is contrary to \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s text, as well as to the purposes it reflects.  The statute draws no distinction between secretarial assignees and presidential appointees, nor between those who exercise the duties of an office and those who formally hold it.  True enough, we have sometimes referred to \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A) as a rule about dual \xe2\x80\x9coffice-holding,\xe2\x80\x9d see <i>supra,</i> at 21, 22, n. 10\xe2\x80\x94but that is mere shorthand.  In fact, \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition applies broadly, and uniformly, to any military officer who \xe2\x80\x9chold[s], or exercise[s] the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d a covered civil office.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept as otherwise authorized\xe2\x80\x9d caveat applies in the same way\xe2\x80\x94to \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d alike.  So the very distinction that Ortiz relies on, the statute rejects: Indeed, the law could not be clearer in its indifference.  That is because Congress determined that military officers threaten civilian preeminence in government by <i>either</i> \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d <i>or</i> \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[ing] the functions of\xe2\x80\x9d important civil offices.  Except .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if Congress decides otherwise and says as much.</p><p>And once again, here Congress did exactly that.  Judge Mitchell became a CMCR judge, while remaining in the military, because of a secretarial assignment that Congress explicitly authorized.  See <i>supra,</i> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  After his presidential appointment, he continued on the same court, doing the same work, in keeping with the same congressional approval.  Even supposing he obtained a \xe2\x80\x9cnew office\xe2\x80\x9d in the way Ortiz says, that acquisition is of no moment.  With or without that formal office, Judge Mitchell \xe2\x80\x9ch[e]ld, or exercise[d] the functions of,\xe2\x80\x9d a CMCR judgeship, and so was subject to \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s ban.  But likewise, with or without that formal office, Judge Mitchell could receive permission from Congress to do the job\xe2\x80\x94that is, to sit as a judge on the CMCR.  And \xc2\xa7950f(b)(2) gave Judge Mitchell that legislative green light, from the date of his assignment through his ruling on Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s case and beyond.</p><p>B</p><p>Finally, Ortiz raises an Appointments Clause challenge to Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on the CCA and the CMCR.  That Clause provides that the President \xe2\x80\x9cshall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d but that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  Litigants usually invoke the Appointments Clause when they object to how a government official is placed in his office.  A litigant may assert, for example, that because someone is a principal rather than an inferior officer, he must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate.  (Recall that just such an argument about CMCR judges led to Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s presidential appointment.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.)  But Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s argument is not of that genre.  He does not claim that the process used to make Judge Mitchell either a CCA judge or a CMCR judge violated the Appointments Clause.  Instead, he claims to find in that Clause a principle relating to dual service.  A CCA judge, Ortiz notes, is an inferior officer.  See <i>Edmond</i>, 520 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 666.  But a CMCR judge, he says (though the Government has argued otherwise), is a principal officer.  And in Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s view, a single judge cannot, consistent with the Appointments Clause, serve as an inferior officer on one court and a principal officer on another.  He calls such dual office-holding \xe2\x80\x9cincongru[ous]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally incompatible.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 50.  The problem, he suggests, is that the other (inferior officer) judges on the CCA will be \xe2\x80\x9cunduly influenced by\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s principal-officer status on the CMCR.  <i>Id.,</i> at 51.</p><p>But that argument stretches too far.  This Court has never read the Appointments Clause to impose rules about dual service, separate and distinct from methods of appointment.  Nor has it ever recognized principles of \xe2\x80\x9cincongruity\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cincompatibility\xe2\x80\x9d to test the permissibility of holding two offices.  As Ortiz himself acknowledges, he can \xe2\x80\x9ccite no authority holding that the Appointments Clause prohibits this sort of simultaneous service.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 52.</p><p>And if we were ever to apply the Clause to dual office-holding, we would not start here.  Ortiz tells no plausible story about how Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s service on the CMCR would result in \xe2\x80\x9cundue influence\xe2\x80\x9d on his CCA colleagues.  The CMCR does not review the CCA\xe2\x80\x99s decisions (or vice versa); indeed, the two courts do not have any overlapping jurisdiction.  They are parts of separate judicial systems, adjudicating different kinds of charges against different kinds of defendants.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1\xe2\x80\x933, and n. 1.  We cannot imagine that anyone on the CCA acceded to Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s views because he also sat on the CMCR\xe2\x80\x94any more than we can imagine a judge on an Article III Court of Appeals yielding to a colleague because she did double duty on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review (another specialized court).  The CAAF put the point well: \xe2\x80\x9cWhen Colonel Mitchell sits as a CCA judge, he is no different from any other CCA judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  76 M.\xc2\xa0J., at 193; see <i>supra,</i> at 5.  So there is no violation of the Appointments Clause.</p><p>IV</p><p>This Court has appellate jurisdiction to review the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  In exercising that jurisdiction, we hold that Judge Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s simultaneous service on the CCA and the CMCR violated neither \xc2\xa7973(b)(2)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s office-holding ban nor the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Appointments Clause.

But the dissent is reading from the wrong part of the opinion.  <i>Vallandigham </i>contained two holdings\xe2\x80\x94first (and relevant here), that Article III precluded the Court from exercising appellate jurisdiction over the commission\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, and second (and irrelevant here), that the Judiciary Act of 1789 had not authorized such jurisdiction.  The language the dissent quotes relates only to the irrelevant statutory holding: The Judiciary Act, the Court explained, confined our jurisdiction to decisions of Article III courts, and the commission did not fit under that rubric.  By contrast, the language we quote in the text formed the basis of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional holding\xe2\x80\x94which is all that matters here.  Second, the dissent contends that <i>Vallandigham</i> \xe2\x80\x9c<i>recognized</i> that the military tribunal had \xe2\x80\x98judicial character,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d even as it found jurisdiction lacking.  <i>Post</i>, at 11.  Not so.  <i>Vallandigham</i> expressly <i>rejected</i> the argument that the commission had \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Wall., at 253.  Though the Court understood that the commission pronounced guilt and imposed sentences, it did not think the commission was acting as a court in rendering its decisions.  See <i>ibid.</i> (citing <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ferreira</i>, 13 How. 40, 46\xe2\x80\x9347 (1852), in which the Court held that a claims tribunal was without judicial \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter\xe2\x80\x9d and labeled its decisions the \xe2\x80\x9caward[s] of a commissioner,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnot the judgment[s] of a court of justice\xe2\x80\x9d). </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T9">9</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text"> The dissent contends that the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions are not always final because the President, relevant branch secretary, or one of his subordinates must approve a sentence of death or dismissal from the armed forces before it goes into effect.  See <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  But as the Government has explained, the President\xe2\x80\x99s (or other executive official\xe2\x80\x99s) authority at that stage extends only to punishment: It is \xe2\x80\x9cakin to relief by commutation in the federal or state system.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 57; see <i>Loving </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 62 M.\xc2\xa0J. 235, 247 (CAAF 2005) (likening the approval authority to \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive clemency powers\xe2\x80\x9d).

I also agree that the statute giving this Court appellate jurisdiction to review the decisions of the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF),\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259, complies with Article III of the Constitution.  I write separately to explain why that conclusion is consistent with the Founders\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of judicial power\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the distinction they drew between public and private rights.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Article III vests \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judicial Power of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court and any inferior courts that Congress chooses to establish.  \xc2\xa71.  The judicial power includes the power to resolve the specific types of \xe2\x80\x9cCases\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cControversies\xe2\x80\x9d listed in \xc2\xa72.  Article III divides this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction over those cases into two categories: \xe2\x80\x9coriginal Jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cappellate Jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court has original jurisdiction in cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls, and cases in which a State is a party.  This Court has appellate jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all the other Cases before mentioned\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72.  Because all agree that the CAAF decides \xe2\x80\x9cother Cases\xe2\x80\x9d that are not reserved for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s original jurisdiction, we can review its decisions only under our appellate jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text of Article III imposes two important limits on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction.  First, as mentioned, this Court can review only the \xe2\x80\x9cother Cases\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cbefore mentioned\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> the subject matters of cases listed in \xc2\xa72 that are not reserved for its original jurisdiction.  Second, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappellate Jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be \xe2\x80\x9coriginal.\xe2\x80\x9d  As Chief Justice Marshall explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d is that \xe2\x80\x9cit revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marbury </i>v.<i> Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 175 (1803).  Thus, this Court cannot exercise appellate jurisdiction unless it is reviewing an already completed exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In re Sanborn</i>,\n\n148 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222, 224 (1893); see also <i>The Alicia</i>, 7 Wall. 571, 573 (1869) (\xe2\x80\x9cAn appellate jurisdiction necessarily implies some judicial determination, some judgment, decree, or order of an inferior tribunal, from which an appeal has been taken\xe2\x80\x9d); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa71755, p.\xc2\xa0627 (1833) (explaining that this Court can review only decisions \xe2\x80\x9cby one clothed with judicial authority, and acting in a judicial capacity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other than these two limits, the text of Article III imposes no other self-executing constraints on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction.  Most notably, it does not require appeals to come from any specific type of tribunal, such as an Article III court.  As Justice Story explained, \xe2\x80\x9cThe appellate power is not limited by the terms of the third article to any particular courts.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. It is the <i>case</i>, then, and not <i>the</i> <i>court</i>, that gives the jurisdiction.  If the judicial power extends to the case, it will be in vain to search in the letter of the constitution for any qualification as to the tribunal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304, 338 (1816).  Hamilton made the same point years earlier: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Constitution in direct terms gives an appellate jurisdiction to the Supreme Court in all the enumerated cases .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0, without a single expression to confine its operation to the inferior federal courts.  The objects of appeal, not the tribunals from which it is to be made, are alone contemplated.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No.\xc2\xa082, pp.\xc2\xa0493\xe2\x80\x93494 (C.

This Court has relied on the lack of tribunal-specific limits in Article III to exercise appellate jurisdiction over several types of non-Article III courts, including state courts, see <i>Martin</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 338, and territorial courts, see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coe</i>,\n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 76, 85\xe2\x80\x9386 (1894);<i> Wellness Int\xe2\x80\x99l Network, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Sharif</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___\xe2\x80\x93___, n.\xc2\xa02 (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa02) (discussing <i>American Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>356 Bales of Cotton</i>, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828)).  In short, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction requires the exercise of <i>a </i>judicial power, not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9c[<i>t</i>]<i>he</i> judicial Power of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III vests exclusively in the federal courts, \xc2\xa71 (emphasis  added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Founders\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of judicial power was heavily influenced by the well-known distinction between public and private rights.

See <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 10).  They considered \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to act conclusively against [private] rights [as] the core of the judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A disposition of private rights did not amount to an exercise of judicial power, however, unless it also satisfied \xe2\x80\x9csome basic procedural requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nelson 574.  Stated differently, the disposition had to \xe2\x80\x9cassume such a form that the judicial power is capable of acting on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Osborn</i> v. <i>Bank of United States</i>, 9 Wheat. 738, 819 (1824).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hat form generally required the presence (actual or constructive) of adverse parties who had been given some opportunity to be heard before the court rendered a final judgment that bound them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nelson 574.

As I explained in <i>Wellness</i>, military courts adjudicate core private rights to life, liberty, and property.  See 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (dissenting opinion) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  That these courts adjudicate core private rights does not contradict the Vesting Clause of Article III, which permits only federal courts to exercise \xe2\x80\x9cthe judicial Power of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Like other provisions of the Constitution, this language must be read against \xe2\x80\x9ccommonly accepted background understandings and interpretative principles in place when the Constitution was written,\xe2\x80\x9d including the principle that general constitutional rules could apply \xe2\x80\x9cdifferently to civil than to military entities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mascott, Who Are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d? 70 Stan.

Based on the \xe2\x80\x9cconstellation of constitutional provisions that [indicate] Congress has the power to provide for the adjudication of disputes among the Armed Forces it creates,\xe2\x80\x9d our precedents have long construed the Vesting Clause of Article III to extend \xe2\x80\x9conly to <i>civilian</i> judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wellness</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)

In other words, the powers that the Constitution gives Congress over the military are \xe2\x80\x9cso exceptional\xe2\x80\x9d that they are thought to include the power to create courts that can exercise a judicial power outside the confines of Article III.  <i>Northern Pipeline</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 64.

As the Court explains, military courts predate the Constitution, were well-known to the Founders, were authorized by the First Congress, and are expressly contemplated by the\n \nFifth Amendment.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  The crucial point for present purposes, however, is that military courts are considered exempt from the structural requirements of Article III \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of other provisions of the Constitution, not because of the definition of judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Wellness</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (opinion of Thomas, J.)

If agencies exercised core judicial power, he notes, they would be acting unconstitutionally because they do not enjoy the structural protections of Article III.  See <i>Arlington</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 290, 304, n.\xc2\xa04 (2013).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">These arguments miss the mark.  While the CAAF is in the Executive Branch and its purpose is to help the President maintain troop discipline, those facts do not change the <i>nature</i> of the power that it exercises.  See Brigadier General S.\xc2\xa0T. Ansell\xe2\x80\x99s Brief Filed in Support of His Office Opinion (Dec. 11, 1917), reprinted in Hearings on S.\xc2\xa064 before the Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Military Affairs, 66th Cong., 1st Sess., 71, 76 (1919).  And it is the nature of the power, not the branch exercising it, that controls our appellate jurisdiction:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe controlling question is whether the function to be exercised .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is a judicial function .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

That the Constitution permits this Executive Branch entity to<i> </i>exercise a particular judicial power\xe2\x80\x94due to the political branches\xe2\x80\x99 expansive constitutional powers over the military\xe2\x80\x94does not change the analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Professor Bamzai\xe2\x80\x99s analogy to administrative agencies is flawed.  Professor Bamzai assumes that, when administrative agencies adjudicate private rights, they are not exercising judicial power.  But they are.

(slip op., at 14).  The CAAF does enjoy such a carveout, as I explained in <i>Wellness</i>.  But both it and administrative agencies exercise a judicial power when they adjudicate private rights.  Contrary to the premise underlying Professor Bamzai\xe2\x80\x99s argument, questions implicating the separation of powers cannot be answered by arguing, in circular fashion, that whatever the Executive Branch does is necessarily an exercise of executive power.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the CAAF exercises a judicial power, the statute giving this Court appellate jurisdiction over its decisions does not violate Article III.

After his Federalist Party was defeated in the pivotal election of 1800, outgoing President John Adams attempted to fill the Federal Judiciary with individuals favored by his party.  The Senate confirmed Adams\xe2\x80\x99s nominees, and Adams diligently signed their commissions and sent them to the Secretary of State, one John Marshall, so that the Great Seal could be affixed and the commissions could be delivered.  Most of the commissions were promptly sealed and dispatched, but a few were left behind, including the commission of William Marbury, who had been nominated and confirmed as a justice of the peace for the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After Thomas Jefferson was sworn in as the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s third President, he was furious about Adams\xe2\x80\x99s eleventh-hour judicial appointments,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] and his Secretary of State, James Madison, made a fateful decision.  Evaluating the facts and the law as he saw them, Madison concluded that he was under no legal obligation to deliver the commissions that had been left in Marshall\xe2\x80\x99s office, and he decided not to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Outraged, Marbury filed suit directly in our Court, asking that Madison be ordered to deliver his commission.  But we dismissed his case, holding, among other things, that it did not fall within our \xe2\x80\x9cappellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137, 175\xe2\x80\x93176, 180 (1803).  Why?  Because \xe2\x80\x9cappellate jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d means jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9cthe proceedings in a cause [<i>i.e.,</i> a case] already instituted\xe2\x80\x9d in another court.  <i>Id</i>., at 175.  Madison was an Executive Branch officer, not a court, and therefore Marbury\xe2\x80\x99s dispute with Madison did not become a \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d or case until it was brought before this Court.  As a result, review of Madison\xe2\x80\x99s decision did not fall within our \xe2\x80\x9cappellate\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 175\xe2\x80\x93176.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That conclusion was straightforward enough.  But suppose that Madison\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process had been more formal.  Suppose that he had heard argument about his legal obligations\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps even testimony about Marbury\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications.  (After all, President Jefferson reappointed some of Adams\xe2\x80\x99s nominees, but not Marbury.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>])  Or suppose Madison had convened an Executive Branch committee to make an initial determination.  Suppose that this entity was labeled the \xe2\x80\x9cCourt of Commission Review.\xe2\x80\x9d  Suppose that the members wore robes and were called judges, held their meeting in a courthouse, and adopted court-like procedures.  With all these adornments, would Madison\xe2\x80\x99s decision have fallen within our appellate jurisdiction?  Would <i>Marbury</i> v. <i>Madison</i> have come out the other way?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The answer is no, and the reason is the same as before.  Our appellate jurisdiction permits us to review one thing: the lawful exercise of <i>judicial</i> power.  Lower federal courts exercise the judicial power of the United States.  State courts exercise the judicial power of sovereign state governments.  Even territorial courts, we have held, exercise the judicial power of the territorial governments set up by Congress.  Executive Branch officers, on the other hand, cannot lawfully exercise the judicial power of <i>any</i> sovereign, no matter how court-like their decisionmaking process might appear.  That means their decisions cannot be appealed directly to our Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have followed this rule for more than two centuries.  It squarely resolves this case.  Courts-martial are older than the Republic and have always been understood to be Executive Branch entities that help the President, as Commander in Chief, to discipline the Armed Forces.  As currently constituted, military tribunals do not comply with Article III, and thus they cannot exercise the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s judicial power.  That fact compels us to dismiss Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s petition for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is unprecedented, and it flatly violates the unambiguous text of the Constitution.  Although the arguments in the various opinions issued today may seem complex, the ultimate issue is really quite simple.  The Court and the concurrence say that Congress may confer part of the judicial power of the United States on an entity that is indisputably part of the Executive Branch.  But Article III of the Constitution vests \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Judicial Power of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94every single drop of it\xe2\x80\x94in \xe2\x80\x9cone supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish\xe2\x80\x9d in compliance with that Article.  A decision more contrary to the plain words of the Constitution is not easy to recall.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under Article III of the Constitution, the judicial power of the United States may be vested only in tribunals whose judges have life tenure and salary protection.  \xc2\xa71.  \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no exception to this rule in the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Benner</i> v. <i>Porter</i>, 9 How. 235, 244 (1850); <i>Oil States Energy Services, LLC</i> v. <i>Greene\xe2\x80\x99s Energy Group, LLC</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936); <i>Stern</i> v. <i>Marshall</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462, 503 (2011); <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 1 Wheat. 304, 330\xe2\x80\x93331 (1816) (Story, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces (CAAF) is not such a tribunal.  Its judges serve 15-year terms and can be removed by the President for cause.  10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7942(b), (c).  As the majority acknowledges, the CAAF is an Executive Branch entity, and as such, it cannot be vested with the judicial power conferred by Article III.   If the CAAF <i>were</i> to do something that either amounts to or requires the exercise of judicial power, it would be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After specifying the only institutions that may exercise the judicial power of the United States, Article III defines the permissible scope of the jurisdiction of this Court.  Article III allows us to exercise both \xe2\x80\x9coriginal\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cappellate\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  Our original jurisdiction is limited to \xe2\x80\x9cCases affecting Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, and those in which a State shall be Party,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72, so it is obvious that Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s case does not fall within our original jurisdiction.  But what about our appellate jurisdiction?  If we directly reviewed a decision of the CAAF, would that be an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cappellate\xe2\x80\x9d review in the sense meant by Article III?  The answer is no.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The understanding of appellate jurisdiction embodied in Article III has deep roots.  Blackstone explained that a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt of appeal\xe2\x80\x9d has jurisdiction only to \xe2\x80\x9creverse or affirm the judgment of the inferior<i> courts</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 411 (1768) (Blackstone) (emphasis added).  Echoing Blackstone, we have held that our appellate jurisdiction permits us to act only as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] supervising Court, whose peculiar province it is to correct the errors of an inferior Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Cohens</i> v. <i>Vir- ginia</i>, 6 Wheat. 264, 396 (1821) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  And we have reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n appellate jurisdiction necessarily implies some judicial determination, some judgment, decree, or order of an inferior tribunal, from which an appeal has been taken.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>The Alicia</i>, 7 Wall. 571, 573 (1869); <i>Webster</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, 10 How. 54, 55 (1850); 3 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States \xc2\xa7916, p.\xc2\xa0652 (1833) (Story).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Those principles make it easy to understand what <i>Marbury</i> meant when it held<i> </i>that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is the essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction, that it revises and corrects the proceedings in a cause already instituted, and does not create that cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Cranch, at 175.  The cause (or case) must have been created previously, somewhere else.  And as Blackstone suggested, what \xe2\x80\x9ccreates\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d in the relevant sense\xe2\x80\x94that is, what transforms a dispute into a \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d that an appellate court has jurisdiction to resolve\xe2\x80\x94is the prior submission of the dispute to a tribunal that is lawfully vested with judicial power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We held exactly that not long after <i>Marbury</i>, and in a decision no less seminal.  A dispute \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes a case\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Article III, we held, only when it \xe2\x80\x9cassume[s] such a form that <i>the judicial power</i> is <i>capable of acting</i> on it.  That power is capable of acting only when the subject is <i>submitted to it</i> by a party who asserts his rights in the form prescribed by law.  It <i>then</i> becomes a case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Osborn</i> v. <i>Bank of United States</i>, 9 Wheat. 738, 819 (1824) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (emphasis added).  Hence, in order to create a \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III permits us to review on appeal, a litigant must have first \xe2\x80\x9csubmitted\xe2\x80\x9d the dispute to another tribunal that was \xe2\x80\x9ccapable\xe2\x80\x9d of exercising the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power\xe2\x80\x9d of the government to which the tribunal belongs.  As discussed, Executive Branch tribunals cannot fill that essential role.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We reiterated this principle in <i>Cohens</i>, another foundational precedent of the Marshall Court.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo commence a suit,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Justice Marshall explained, \xe2\x80\x9cis to demand something by the institution of process <i>in a Court of justice</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 Wheat., at 408 (emphasis added).  Courts of justice are those tribunals \xe2\x80\x9cerected by\xe2\x80\x9d the sovereign and properly vested with the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s own \xe2\x80\x9cpower of judicature.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Blackstone 257 (1765).  When the sovereign is the Federal Government, that means only courts established under Article III, for only those courts may exercise the judicial power of the United States.  See <i>Cohens</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 405; The Federalist No. 78, pp.\xc2\xa0469\xe2\x80\x93472 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe courts of justice\xe2\x80\x9d are those described in Article III).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This view of appellate jurisdiction explains why, in <i>Martin</i> v. <i>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, Justice Story declared that \xe2\x80\x9cif .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. congress should not establish [inferior Article III] courts, the appellate jurisdiction of the supreme court would have nothing to act upon, unless it could act upon cases pending in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Wheat., at 339\xe2\x80\x93340.  Without decisions of Article III courts or state courts to review, our appellate jurisdiction would have lain idle\xe2\x80\x94but <i>not</i> because there were no Executive Branch tribunals, like the CAAF, deciding federal questions.  To the contrary, executive agencies have \xe2\x80\x9cconduct[ed] adjudications\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94often taking \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98judicial\xe2\x80\x99 forms\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9csince the beginning of the Republic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arlington</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 290, 304\xe2\x80\x93305, n.\xc2\xa04 (2013);<i> Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868, 910 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see generally J. Mashaw, Creating the Administrative Constitution 34\xe2\x80\x9335 (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Such Executive Branch adjudications, however, do not give rise to \xe2\x80\x9ccases\xe2\x80\x9d that Article III grants us appellate jurisdiction to review, precisely because officers of the Executive Branch cannot lawfully be vested with judicial power.  That is why Chief Justice Marshall declared, without qualification, that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] mandamus to an <i>officer</i> [of the Executive Branch] is held to be the exercise of original jurisdiction; but a mandamus to an <i>inferior court </i>of the United States, is in the nature of appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ex parte Crane</i>, 5 Pet. 190, 193 (1831) (emphasis added).  Time has not sown doubts about the truth of that rule.  <i>E.g., Verizon Md. Inc.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md.</i>,\n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 635, 644, n.\xc2\xa03 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review of executive action, including determinations made by a state administrative agency,\xe2\x80\x9d involves the exercise of federal court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coriginal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d rather than its \xe2\x80\x9cappellate jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d which covers only \xe2\x80\x9cstate-court judgments\xe2\x80\x9d); L. Jaffe, Judicial Control of Administrative Action 263, n.\xc2\xa05 (1965).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have taken this same approach when deciding whether we may assert appellate jurisdiction to review the decision of a state tribunal: We look to state law to see whether the tribunal in question was eligible to receive the State\xe2\x80\x99s judicial power.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Betts</i> v. <i>Brady</i>,\n\n316 U.\xc2\xa0S. 455, 458\xe2\x80\x93460 (1942); cf. <i>Chicago, R. I. &amp; P. R. Co.</i> v. <i>Stude</i>,\n\n346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 574, 578\xe2\x80\x93579 (1954) (federal courts cannot exercise removal jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94which is appellate in nature, <i>Martin</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 349\xe2\x80\x94while a dispute is still in state \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings; removal is proper only after \xe2\x80\x9cthe jurisdiction of the state district court is invoked\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Verizon Md.</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This understanding of appellate jurisdiction bars our review here.  The dispute between Ortiz and the Federal Government has been presented to four tribunals: the initial court-martial, the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals, the CAAF, and this Court.  Each of those tribunals belongs to a branch of the Federal Government.  Yet only one of them\xe2\x80\x94our Court\xe2\x80\x94is capable, under the Constitution, of exercising the Government\xe2\x80\x99s judicial power.  Thus, the dispute between Ortiz and the Federal Government did not become an Article III \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d until Ortiz petitioned our Court to hear it.  That means our present adjudication\xe2\x80\x94no less than our adjudication of the dispute between Marbury and Madison\xe2\x80\x94lacks \xe2\x80\x9cthe essential criterion of appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Cranch, at 175.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority does not question this framework; indeed, it acknowledges that, per <i>Marbury</i>, we can assert jurisdiction here only if the dispute before us blossomed into an Article III \xe2\x80\x9ccase\xe2\x80\x9d before it landed at our doorstep.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Curiously, however, the majority basically proceeds as though <i>Marbury</i> were our last word on the subject.  <i>Ante,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  That is simply not right.  As discussed, our foundational precedents expressly delineate the prerequisites to the formation of a constitutional case: The dispute must, at a minimum, have been previously presented to and decided by a tribunal lawfully vested with the judicial power of the government to which it belongs.  Nothing of the sort occurred here; traversing a series of \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings\xe2\x80\x9d internal to the Executive Branch, <i>ante,</i> at 7, does not count.  And while there undoubtedly are differences between this case and <i>Marbury</i>, even some that \xe2\x80\x9clea[p] off the page,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 18, those distinctions are irrelevant to our jurisdiction.  The dispositive common ground is that, just as in <i>Marbury</i>, we are here asked to resolve a dispute that has been presented only to Executive Branch officers.  The present dispute thus lies beyond the \xe2\x80\x9cpeculiar province\xe2\x80\x9d of our appellate jurisdiction to review.  <i>Cohens</i>, 6 Wheat., at 396.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">If there were any doubt that Article III forbids us to take appeals directly from the Executive Branch, two centuries of precedent\xe2\x80\x94almost all of it overlooked by the majority\xe2\x80\x94would put those doubts to rest.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First consider the history of our relationship with the Court of Claims.  Congress established that court in 1855 to adjudicate claims against the United States.  \xc2\xa71, 10 Stat. 612.  Congress provided the court\xe2\x80\x99s judges with life tenure and salary protection, just as Article III requires.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Court of Claims was a court of record, and it followed all the procedures\xe2\x80\x94and possessed all the ancillary powers (subpoena, contempt, etc.)\xe2\x80\x94that one would expect to find in a court of justice.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73\xe2\x80\x937,\n\n10Stat.\n613; \xc2\xa74,\n\n12Stat.\n765\xe2\x80\x93766.  Its decisions had preclusive effect, and were appealable directly to our Court.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77, 5, <i>id</i>., at 766.  If the court rendered judgment for a claimant, however, the Secretary of the Treasury could partially revise its decision by modifying the amount of the judgment to be paid (though not the court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion that the claimant was in the right).  \xc2\xa714, <i>id</i>., at 768.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under principles as old as <i>Hayburn\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 2 Dall. 409 (1792), a court whose judgments are not self-executing no more complies with Article III than a tribunal whose judges are not life tenured.  For that reason alone, we dismissed for lack of jurisdiction the first time a party appealed a Court of Claims decision directly to our Court.  <i>Gordon</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 2 Wall. 561 (1865), 117 U.\xc2\xa0S. Appx. 697 (1864).  It did not even matter that the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in that case had been <i>against</i> the claimant, and was thus immune from revision, and would have been fully binding if we had affirmed.  All that mattered was that the Court of Claims, like the CAAF, lacked an attribute that Article III makes prerequisite to the vesting of judicial power.  <i>Id.,</i> at 704.  In words that apply as much here, we said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe so-called judgments of the Court of Claims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could not be deemed an exercise of judicial power, and could not, therefore, be revised by this court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In re Sanborn</i>,\n\n148 U.\xc2\xa0S. 222, 224 (1893).  It was irrelevant how much the Court of Claims otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cresemble[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts whose decisions we review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The story does not end there, however.  In 1866 Congress did something it has never done with respect to courts-martial: It brought the Court of Claims into compliance with Article III by repealing the provision that made some of its decisions revisable by the Treasury Secretary.  Ch. 19, \xc2\xa71,\n\n14Stat.\n9.  We began hearing appeals from it \xe2\x80\x9cimmediately.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jones</i>,\n\n119 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, 478 (1886).  We now were able to \xe2\x80\x9caccep[t] appellate jurisdiction over what was, necessarily, an exercise of the judicial power which <i>alone</i> [we] may review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Glidden Co.</i> v. <i>Zdanok</i>,\n\n370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530, 554 (1962) (plurality opinion) (citing <i>Marbury</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 174\xe2\x80\x93175; emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Next consider our practice in entertaining petitions for writs of habeas corpus.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Four years after <i>Marbury</i>, we reaffirmed its core holding in <i>Ex parte Bollman</i>, 4 Cranch 75 (1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  Two men were taken into federal custody, and their confinement was approved by an Article III court.  <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bollman</i>, 24 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 1189, 1190, 1196 (No. 14,622) (CC DC 1807).  They then petitioned our Court for a writ of habeas corpus.  Applying <i>Marbury</i>, we held that the jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9cwhich the court is now asked to exercise is clearly <i>appellate</i>.  It is the revision of a decision of an inferior court.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Cranch, at 101.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrast <i>Bollman</i> with <i>Ex parte Barry</i>, 2 How. 65 (1844) (Story, J.), and <i>In re Metzger</i>, 5 How. 176 (1847).  In <i>Barry</i>, the petitioner sought relief in this Court without first presenting his claim to an inferior federal court or a state court, and so Justice Story explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he case, then, is one avowedly and nakedly for the exercise of original jurisdiction by this court,\xe2\x80\x9d and was required to be dismissed.  2 How., at 65.  In <i>Metzger</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe district judge\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9cheard and decided\xe2\x80\x9d the lawfulness of the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s custody, but the judge had done so only \xe2\x80\x9c<i>at his chambers</i>, and not in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 How., at 191 (emphasis added).  His judgment was not provisional, like some early Court of Claims decisions\xe2\x80\x94but his status as a judge at chambers was still fatal to our jurisdiction.  In a technical sense, a judge at chambers \xe2\x80\x9cexercises a special authority\xe2\x80\x9d distinct from the judicial power vested by Article III\xe2\x80\x94which meant that the Constitution would permit us to review his decision in \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he exercise of an original jurisdiction only.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 191\xe2\x80\x93192.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, and especially pertinent here, we have adhered to the <i>Marbury </i>principle in the many instances in our Court\xe2\x80\x99s history in which we have been asked to review the decision of a military tribunal.  First, in <i>Ex parte Vallandigham</i>, 1 Wall. 243 (1864), an Ohio resident had been tried and sentenced by a military commission, and its decision became final after being approved up the chain of command.  Vallandigham sought relief directly from our Court, without first petitioning a lower federal court.  We held that we lacked jurisdiction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 254.  The military commission, like the CAAF, was not one of the \xe2\x80\x9ccourts of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d established under Article III, <i>id.,</i> at 251, and thus it could not exercise the judicial power of the Federal Government, but could exercise only \xe2\x80\x9ca special authority,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 253\xe2\x80\x94just like the Court of Claims, and just like a judge at chambers.  Given that fact, we held it was \xe2\x80\x9ccertain\xe2\x80\x9d that any review of its decisions could take place only in the exercise of our original, and not appellate, jurisdiction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 251\xe2\x80\x93252.  And despite what the majority seems to think, see <i>ante,</i> at 17, n.\xc2\xa08, in <i>Vallandigham </i>we <i>recognized</i> that the military tribunal had \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that it had \xe2\x80\x9cthe authority .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to examine, to decide and sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d but\xe2\x80\x94in the same breath\xe2\x80\x94we affirmed the crucial point, namely, that such character \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is not judicial .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the sense in which judicial <i>power</i> is granted to the courts of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Wall., at 253 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contrast <i>Vallandigham</i> with a pair of decisions we issued shortly thereafter.  In <i>Ex parte Milligan</i>, 4 Wall. 2 (1866), and <i>Ex parte Yerger</i>, 8 Wall. 85 (1869), we again were asked to grant relief to petitioners who, just like Vallandigham (and just like Ortiz), were in custody under orders of a non-Article III military tribunal.  But unlike Vallandigham and Ortiz, Milligan and Yerger first sought relief in a lower federal court.  <i>Milligan</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 107\xe2\x80\x93108; <i>Yerger</i>, 8 Wall., at 102\xe2\x80\x93103.  That fact made all the difference\xe2\x80\x94again, because of the rule that we possess, \xe2\x80\x9cunder the Constitution, an appellate jurisdiction, to be exercised only in the revision of judicial decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 97.  The decisions of non-Article III military courts do not qualify.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Similarly, after World War II we received \xe2\x80\x9cmore than a hundred\xe2\x80\x9d habeas petitions from individuals in the custody of \xe2\x80\x9cvarious American or international military tribunals abroad,\xe2\x80\x9d almost none of whom had \xe2\x80\x9cfirst sought [relief\xc2\xa0] in a lower federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Fallon, J. Manning, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 292 (7th ed. 2015).  Consistent with <i>Marbury</i>, we denied review in every one.  Fallon, <i>supra,</i> at 292\xe2\x80\x93293.  Thus, while it is surely true that \xe2\x80\x9cnot every military tribunal is alike\xe2\x80\x9d in all respects, <i>ante, </i>at 17, before today, they were at least alike in this respect: Their decisions could not be reviewed directly here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The unbroken line of authorities discussed above vividly illustrates the nature and limits of our appellate jurisdiction as defined in Article III.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision cannot be squared with those authorities, and the majority barely even tries.  The majority says not a word about the Court of Claims, even though that tribunal surely had sufficient \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-likeness,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 16 (emphasis deleted), to come within the scope of our appellate jurisdiction under today\xe2\x80\x99s test.  Nor does the majority acknowledge the slew of on-point habeas decisions\xe2\x80\x94save for <i>Vallandigham</i>, which it waves away by emphasizing irrelevant factual details (like the commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s facial hair).  Despite its running refrain that the CAAF displays a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial <i>character</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 6 (emphasis added); see also <i>ante, </i>at 8, 18, 19, the majority simply never comes to grips with the substance of our holdings: We may not hear an appeal directly from any tribunal that has not been lawfully vested with judicial <i>power</i>.  That rule directly covers the CAAF, and it bars our review.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Having said very little about a large body of controlling precedent, the majority says very much about the fact that we have long heard appeals directly from territorial courts and the courts of the District of Columbia.  <i>Ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9316.  The majority claims to be looking for a \xe2\x80\x9cpowerful reason\xe2\x80\x9d why our appellate jurisdiction should treat courts-martial any differently.  <i>Ante,</i> at 15.  A careful reading of our decisions shows that we have a good reason ready at hand\xe2\x80\x94one that is fully consistent with <i>Marbury</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The reason, as I explain below, is this: Congress enjoys a unique authority to create governments for the Territories and the District of Columbia and to confer on the various branches of those governments powers that are distinct from the legislative, executive, and judicial power of the United States.  Thus, for example, the courts of the District of Columbia exercise the judicial power of the District, not that of the United States.  The courts of the United States Virgin Islands exercise the judicial power of that Territory, not the judicial power of the United States.  By contrast, the CAAF and other military tribunals are indisputably part of the Executive Branch of the Government of the United States.  They exercise the power of the United States, not that of any other government, and since they are part of the Executive, the only power that they may lawfully exercise is executive, not judicial.  Unless they are removed from the Executive Branch and transformed into Article III courts, they may not exercise any part of the judicial power of the United States.  Nor need they exercise judicial power to carry out their functions, as we have always understood.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We have long said that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to govern the Territories and the District of Columbia stems as much from its inherent sovereign powers as it does from specific constitutional provisions in Articles IV and I.  <i>Sere</i> v. <i>Pitot</i>, 6 Cranch 332, 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (1810) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.); <i>American Ins. Co.</i> v. <i>356 Bales of Cotton</i>, 1 Pet. 511, 546 (1828) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.); <i>Late Corp. of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n136 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 42 (1890); see also Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa02 (Territories); Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa017 (District).  Perhaps reflecting that view, the founding generation understood\xe2\x80\x94and for more than two centuries, we have recognized\xe2\x80\x94that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to govern the Territories and the District is <i>sui generis</i> in one very specific respect: When exercising it, Congress is not bound by the Vesting Clauses of Articles I, II, and III.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Vesting Clauses impose strict limits on the kinds of institutions that Congress can vest with legislative, executive, and judicial power.  See generally<i> Department of Transportation</i> v. <i>Association of American Railroads</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).  Those limits apply when Congress legislates in every other area, including when it regulates the Armed Forces.  See <i>Loving</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 748, 767\xe2\x80\x93768, 771\xe2\x80\x93774 (1996) (Article I nondelegation doctrine applies to congressional regulation of courts-martial).  But it has been our consistent view that those same limits do not apply when Congress creates institutions to govern the Territories and the District.  As we said in <i>Benner</i> v. <i>Porter</i>, 9 How. 235, 242 (1850), territorial governments set up by Congress \xe2\x80\x9care not organized under the Constitution, nor subject to its complex distribution of the powers of government, as the organic law; but are the creations, exclusively, of the legislative department.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress may therefore give territorial governments \xe2\x80\x9ca legislative, an executive, and a judiciary, with such powers as it has been their will to assign to those departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sere</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 337.  That is why we have often repeated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n legislating for [the Territories], Congress exer- cises the combined powers of the general, and of a state government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>American Ins. Co.</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 546; <i>Palmore</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n411 U.\xc2\xa0S. 389, 403 (1973).  Just as the Vesting Clauses do not constrain the States in organizing their own governments, <i>Dreyer</i> v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n187 U.\xc2\xa0S. 71, 84 (1902), those Clauses do not constrain Congress in organizing territorial governments.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, unlike any of its other powers, Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power over the Territories allows it to create governments in miniature, and to vest those governments with the legislative, executive, and judicial powers, not of the United States, but of the Territory itself.  For that reason we have upheld delegations of legislative, executive, and judicial power to territorial governments despite acknowledging that each one would be incompatible with the Vesting Clauses of the Federal Constitution if those Clauses applied.  See, <i>e.g., Dorr</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n195 U.\xc2\xa0S. 138, 153 (1904) (territorial legislature); <i>Cincinnati Soap Co.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n301 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308, 322\xe2\x80\x93323 (1937); <i>Snow</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 18 Wall. 317, 321\xe2\x80\x93322 (1873) (territorial executive); <i>American Ins. Co.</i>, <i>supra</i> (territorial courts); <i>Sere</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Kendall</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stokes</i>, 12 Pet. 524, 619 (1838); <i>Keller</i> v. <i>Potomac Elec. Power Co.</i>,\n\n261 U.\xc2\xa0S. 428, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (1923).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Framers evidently shared this view.  Thus, James Madison took it for granted that Congress could create \xe2\x80\x9ca municipal legislature\xe2\x80\x9d for the District of Columbia, The Federalist No. 43, at\xc2\xa0272\xe2\x80\x93273, something that would otherwise violate the Vesting Clause of Article I, which prohibits Congress from delegating legislative powers to any other entity, <i>Wayman</i> v. <i>Southard</i>, 10 Wheat. 1, 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (1825) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  And Justice Story declared, without hesitation, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat shall be the form of government established in the territories depends exclusively upon the discretion of congress.  Having a right to erect a territorial government, they may confer on it such powers, legislative, judicial, and executive, as they may deem best.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Story \xc2\xa7667, at 478.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that it is <i>only</i> when Congress legislates for the Territories and the District that it may lawfully vest judicial power in tribunals that do not conform to Article III.  And that, in turn, explains why territorial courts and those of the District\xe2\x80\x94exercising the judicial power of their respective governments\xe2\x80\x94may have their decisions appealed directly here.  We said as much in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Coe</i>,\n\n155 U.\xc2\xa0S. 76, 86 (1894), where we explained that <i>because</i> Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpower of government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. over the Territories .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. includes the ultimate executive, legislative, and judicial power, it follows that the judicial action of all inferior courts established by Congress may, in accordance with the Constitution, be subjected to [our] appellate jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The rule of appellate jurisdiction we recognized in <i>Coe</i> is identical to the rule we have applied ever since <i>Marbury</i>: Our appellate jurisdiction is proper only if the underlying decision represents an exercise of judicial power lawfully vested in the tribunal below.  Territorial courts and those of the District of Columbia have such power; the CAAF does not, and cannot be given it so long as it fails to comply with Article III.  That is reason enough to treat these tribunals differently.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority responds to this conclusion by suggesting, albeit without much elaboration, that just as the Constitution gives Congress the \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d power to confer non-Article III judicial power on the courts of the Territories and the District of Columbia, the Constitution also gives Congress the \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d power to vest military tribunals with non-Article III judicial power.  See <i>ante,</i> at 15, and n.\xc2\xa07.  But the Vesting Clauses are exclusive, which means that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s judicial power is not shared between Article II and Article III.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (collecting cases); see also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Arlington</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 304\xe2\x80\x93305, n.\xc2\xa04; <i>Ex\xc2\xa0parte Randolph</i>, 20 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 242, 254 (No. 11,558) (CC Va. 1833) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.) (those whose \xe2\x80\x9coffices are held at the pleasure of the president .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are, consequently, incapable of exercising any portion of the judicial power\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Association of American Railroads</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 2, 9); <i>B&amp;B Hardware, Inc.</i> v. <i>Hargis Industries, Inc.</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 11).  And neither the majority nor the concurrence ever explains how the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s various provisions relating to the military, through their penumbras and emanations, can be said to produce a hybrid executive-judicial power that is nowhere mentioned in the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text, that is foreclosed by its structure, and that had gone almost entirely unnoticed before today.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, to make the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument parallel to the argument regarding the courts of the Territories and the District of Columbia, the majority would have to argue that the military, like the governments of the Territories and the District, is somehow not part of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cnot organized under the Constitution, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as the organic law,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Benner</i>, 9 How., at 242\xe2\x80\x94but is a government unto itself.  To set out that argument, however, is to expose its weakness, for nothing could be more antithetical to the Constitution and to our traditional understanding of the relationship between the military and civilian authority.  The military is not an entity unto itself, separate from the civilian government established by the Constitution.  On the contrary, it is part of the Executive Branch of the Government of the United States, and it is under the command of the President, who is given the power of Commander in Chief and is ultimately answer- able to the people.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To appreciate the constitutional status of military tribunals, it is helpful to recall their origins.  Courts-martial are older than the Republic, and they have always been understood to be an arm of military command exercising executive power, as opposed to independent courts of law exercising judicial power.  Blackstone declared that the court-martial system of the British Empire was based solely on \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessity of order and discipline\xe2\x80\x9d in the military.  1 Blackstone 400.  Indeed, Blackstone explained that courts-martial exercise a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretionary power\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinflict\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpunishment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. extend[ing] to death itself,\xe2\x80\x9d which was \xe2\x80\x9cto be guided by the directions of the crown,\xe2\x80\x9d in express contrast to \xe2\x80\x9cthe king\xe2\x80\x99s courts\xe2\x80\x9d which dispense \xe2\x80\x9cjustice according to the laws of the land.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 402, 400.  The crown\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cextensive\xe2\x80\x9d power over the military\xe2\x80\x94exercised, in part, through courts-martial\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 408.  Many others have echoed the point.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t the time of our separation [from Britain], .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a court-martial .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. was not a judicial body.  Its functions were not judicial functions.  It was but an agency of the power of military command to do its bidding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ansell, Military Justice, 5 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Q. 1, 6 (1919).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the United States declared its independence and prepared for war with Britain, the leaders of the new Nation were deeply impressed by the British court-martial system and sought to replicate it.  John Adams, who in 1776 drafted the Continental Articles for the Government of the Army, was convinced that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cin vain\xe2\x80\x9d for the American patriots to seek \xe2\x80\x9ca more complete system of military discipline\xe2\x80\x9d than the existing British model.  3 The Works of John Adams 68 (C. Adams ed. 1851).  He and Thomas Jefferson therefore proposed adopting \xe2\x80\x9cthe British articles of war, <i>totidem verbis</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 68\xe2\x80\x9369.  The Continental Congress agreed.  <i>Id.,</i> at 69.  And when the Constitution and the Bill of Rights were adopted, no one suggested that this required any alteration of the existing system of military justice.  On the contrary, as the majority recounts, the First Congress continued the existing articles of war unchanged.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  Courts-martial fit effortlessly into the structure of government established by the Constitution.  They were instruments of military command.  Under the Constitution, the President, as the head of the Executive Branch, was made the Commander in Chief.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72.  So the role of the courts-martial was to assist the President in the exercise of that command authority.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The ratification of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights did naturally raise some constitutional questions.  For example, founding-era courts-martial adjudicated a long list of offenses, some carrying capital punishment, including for crimes involving homicide, assault, and theft.  American Articles of War of 1776, \xc2\xa713, in 2 W. Winthrop, Military Law and Precedents 1495\xe2\x80\x931498 (2d ed. 1896) (Winthrop); see also, <i>e.g.,</i> American Articles of War of 1806, Arts. 39, 51, 54, in <i>id.,</i> at 1514\xe2\x80\x931516.  In civilian life, a person charged with similar offenses was entitled to protections, such as trial by jury, that were unavailable in courts-martial.  Moreover, the Constitution entitled such persons to <i>judicial</i> process\xe2\x80\x94which courts-martial, lacking the necessary structural attributes of Article III courts, could not afford.  So how could they try serious crimes, including even capital offenses?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The simple answer goes back to the fundamental nature of courts-martial as instruments of command.  As Blackstone recognized, the enforcement of military discipline, an essential feature of any effective fighting force, was viewed as an <i>executive</i> prerogative.  It represented the exercise of the power given to the President as the head of the Executive Branch and the Commander in Chief and delegated by him to military commanders.  Thus, adjudications by courts-martial are executive decisions; courts-martial are not courts; they do not wield judicial power; and their proceedings are not criminal prosecutions within the meaning of the Constitution.  As we explained in <i>Milligan</i>, the need to maintain military order required those serving in the military to surrender certain rights that they enjoyed in civilian life and to submit to discipline by the military command.  Although <i>Milligan</i> confirmed the general rule that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the birthright of every American citizen\xe2\x80\x9d to have the Federal Government adjudicate criminal charges against him only in an Article III court, 4 Wall., at 119, 122, we also stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very one connected with\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe military or naval service .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. while thus serving, surrenders his right to be tried by the civil courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 123.  That is why the historical evidence strongly suggests that the provisions of the Bill of Rights were not originally understood to apply to courts-martial.  See Prakash, The Sweeping Domestic War Powers of Congress, 113 Mich. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1337, 1346 (2015); Wiener, Courts-Martial and the Bill of Rights: The Original Practice II, 72 Harv.

Notwithstanding modest reforms in 1874, a court-martial continued into the 20th century to serve \xe2\x80\x9cprimarily as a function or instrument of the executive department to be used in maintaining discipline in the armed forces.  It was therefore not a \xe2\x80\x98court,\xe2\x80\x99 as that term is normally used.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schlueter, The Court-Martial: An Historical Survey, 87 Mil. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 129, 150\xe2\x80\x93153, 154\xe2\x80\x93155 (1980).  Hence, Colonel Winthrop\xe2\x80\x94whom we have called \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98Blackstone of Military Law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Reid</i> v. <i>Covert</i>,\n\n354 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 19, n.\xc2\xa038 (1957) (plurality opinion)\xe2\x80\x94echoed the original Blackstone in describing courts-martial as \xe2\x80\x9csimply <i>instrumentalities of the executive power</i>, provided by Congress for the President as Commander-in-chief, to aid him in properly commanding the army and navy and enforcing discipline therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Winthrop 54.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Indeed, Brigadier General Samuel T. Ansell, who served as acting Judge Advocate General from 1917 to 1919, groused that the American system at the time of World War I was still \xe2\x80\x9cbasically .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the British system as it existed at the time of the separation,\xe2\x80\x9d and described it as one \xe2\x80\x9carising out of and regulated by the mere power of Military Command rather than Law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ansell, 5 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Q., at 1.  Around the same time, Edmund Morgan\xe2\x80\x94who would later help draft the Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)\xe2\x80\x94declared it \xe2\x80\x9ctoo clear for argument that the principle at the foundation of the existing system is the supremacy of military command.  To maintain that principle, military command dominates and controls the proceeding from its initiation to the final execution of the sentence.  While the actual trial has the semblance of a judicial proceeding and is required to be conducted pursuant to the forms of law, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [i]n truth and in fact, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts-martial are exactly what Colonel Winthrop has asserted them to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  Morgan, The Existing Court-Martial System and the Ansell Army Articles, 29 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 52, 66 (1919).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For instance, until 1920 the President and commanding officers could disapprove a court-martial sentence and order that a more severe one be imposed instead, for whatever reason.  We twice upheld the constitutionality of this practice, <i>Swaim </i>v. <i>United States,</i>\n\n165 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553, 564\xe2\x80\x93566 (1897);<i> Ex parte Reed</i>,\n\n100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 13, 20, 23 (1879), which was widely used during World War I, see Wiener, <i>supra,</i> at 273.  Similarly, until 1920 it was permissible for the same officer to serve as both prosecutor and defense counsel in the same case.  West, A History of Command Influence on the Military Judicial System, 18 UCLA L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 14 (1970).  Congress discontinued such practices by statute, but through the end of World War II, courts-martial remained blunt instruments to enforce discipline.  Schlueter, <i>supra,</i> at 157\xe2\x80\x93158; see also West, <i>supra,</i> at 8, n.\xc2\xa018.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is precisely because Article II authorizes the President to discipline the military without invoking the judicial power of the United States that that the Constitution has always been understood to permit courts-martial to operate in the manner described above.  Thus, in <i>Dynes</i> v. <i>Hoover</i>, 20 How. 65, 79 (1858), we said that the Constitution makes clear that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s power to \xe2\x80\x9ctr[y] and punis[h]\xe2\x80\x9d military offenses \xe2\x80\x9cis given without any connection between it and the 3d article of the Constitution defining the judicial power of the United States; indeed, that the two powers are entirely independent of each other.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the principle that the Government need not exercise judicial power when it adjudicates military offenses accords with the historical understanding of the meaning of due process.  In the 19th century, it was widely believed that the constitutional guarantee of due process imposed the rule that the Government must exercise its judicial power before depriving anyone of a core private right.  See generally Nelson, Adjudication in the Political Branches, 107 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 559, 562, 568\xe2\x80\x93569, and n.\xc2\xa042 (2007); <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Cohen</i> v. <i>Wright</i>, 22 Cal. 293, 318 (1863) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe terms \xe2\x80\x98due process of law\xe2\x80\x99 have a distinct legal signification, clearly securing to every person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a judicial trial .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. before he can be deprived of life, liberty, or property\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee </i>v.<i> Hoboken Land &amp; Improvement Co.</i>, 18 How. 272, 275, 280 (1856) (similar).  Yet for most of our history we held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o those in the military or naval service of the United States the military law is due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reaves</i> v. <i>Ainsworth</i>,\n\n219 U.\xc2\xa0S. 296, 304 (1911); <i>United States ex rel. French </i>v.<i> Weeks</i>,\n\n259 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326, 335 (1922); see also <i>Milligan</i>, 4 Wall., at 138 (Chase, C. J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe power of Congress, in the government of the land and naval forces and of the militia, is not at all affected by the fifth or any other amendment\xe2\x80\x9d); Wiener, 72 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 279 (in the history of courts-martial, \xe2\x80\x9cof due process of law as a constitutional concept, there is no trace\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. 1 Blackstone 403\xe2\x80\x93404 (explaining the basic due process rights soldiers surrender upon entering the army).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This understanding of the power wielded by military tribunals parallels our current jurisprudence regarding the authority of other Executive Branch entities to adjudicate disputes that affect individual rights.  An exercise of judicial power may be necessary for the disposition of private rights, including the rights at stake in a criminal case.  <i>B&amp;B Hardware</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313); see also <i>Wellness Int\xe2\x80\x99l Network, Ltd. </i>v.<i> Sharif</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (Thomas, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 6).  But the adjudication of public rights does not demand the exercise of judicial power.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  Similarly, enforcement of military discipline is not a function that demands the exercise of judicial power, either. <i> Dynes</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 284.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, military offenses are \xe2\x80\x9cexceptions\xe2\x80\x9d to Article III in the same way that true public rights disputes are exceptions to Article III: the Federal Government can adjudicate either one without exercising its judicial power.  This means that when Congress assigns either of these functions to an Executive Branch tribunal\xe2\x80\x94whether the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, the Court of Claims, or the CAAF\xe2\x80\x94that does not imply that the tribunal in question is exercising judicial power.  And the point holds notwithstanding the undoubted fidelity to \xe2\x80\x9cthe rule of law\xe2\x80\x9d that such officers bring to their tasks.  <i>Ante, </i>at 11, n.\xc2\xa05.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s odd suggestion, acting \xe2\x80\x9cin strict compliance with legal rules and principles\xe2\x80\x9d is not a uniquely judicial virtue.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The most basic duty of the President and his subordinates, after all, is to \xe2\x80\x9ctake Care that the Laws be <i>faithfully executed</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73 (emphasis added).  Hence, acting with fidelity to law is something every executive officer is charged with doing, but those officers remain <i>executive </i>officers all the same.  For that reason, and in light of the history recounted above, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he military justice system\xe2\x80\x99s essential character\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial,\xe2\x80\x9d and has been \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained\xe2\x80\x9d as such since the \xe2\x80\x9cvery first Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 8, 10, simply does not square with the actual operation of the court-martial system or the consensus view of its place in our constitutional scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In response to this history, the majority tries to enlist Colonel Winthrop as an ally, <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa05, but Winthrop had a firmer grasp than the majority on the distinction between functions that can be described as \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial\xe2\x80\x9d in a colloquial sense and functions that represent an exercise of \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power\xe2\x80\x9d in the constitutional sense.  Thus, while Winthrop observed that courts-martial resemble constitutional courts in certain respects, he made those observations \xe2\x80\x9c<i>[n]otwithstanding</i> that the court-martial is only an instrumentality of the executive power having no relation or connection, in law, with the judicial establishments of the country.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Winthrop 61 (emphasis added).  Nor was Winthrop the only military commentator who employed such terms casually from time to time.  <i>E.g., </i>W. De Hart, Observations on Military Law 6 (1859) (describing an officer\xe2\x80\x99s authority to appoint members of a court-martial as \xe2\x80\x9ca legislative power\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 14 (describing courts-martial as \xe2\x80\x9cbeing clothed with judicial powers\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, our own Court has frequently described functions as \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial\xe2\x80\x9d in a colloquial sense, despite knowing they are executive in the constitutional sense.  <i>E.g., Smelting Co.</i> v. <i>Kemp</i>,\n\n104 U.\xc2\xa0S. 636, 640 (1882) (Land Department officers \xe2\x80\x9cexercise a judicial function\xe2\x80\x9d although they are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the administrative and executive branch of the government\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Murray\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</i>, 18 How., at 280\xe2\x80\x93281; <i>Vallandigham</i>, 1 Wall., at 253;<i> Arlington</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 304\xe2\x80\x93305, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on Attorney General Bates is even weaker.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  Bates wrote a memo to President Lincoln opining that when the President acts to \xe2\x80\x9capprove and confirm the sentence of a court martial,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9crevis[e] its proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress intended him to \xe2\x80\x9cact <i>judicially</i>\xe2\x80\x94that is, [to] exercise the discretion confided to him within the limits of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  11 Op. Atty. Gen. 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (1864).  Bates was arguing that a President could not revoke a court-martial sentence after it had been carried into execution.  He was describing an implicit limit on the power of the President under the system of military justice established by statute.  His reference to certain Presidential actions as \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial\xe2\x80\x9d had nothing to do with judicial review, and in <i>Vallandigham</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 254, we rejected the idea that \xe2\x80\x9cthe President\xe2\x80\x99s action\xe2\x80\x9d in approving a court-martial decision is an exercise of judicial power that we can review directly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In sum, the majority has done nothing to undermine the overwhelming historical consensus that courts-martial permissibly carry out their functions by exercising executive rather than judicial power.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">What remains of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis boils down to the assertion that courts-martial \xe2\x80\x9cresemble\xe2\x80\x9d conventional courts, <i>ante,</i> at 9, indeed, that \xe2\x80\x9ccourt-likeness\xe2\x80\x9d is the dispositive issue, <i>ante,</i> at 16 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first thing to be said in response to this theory is that we have \xe2\x80\x9cnever adopted a \xe2\x80\x98looks like\xe2\x80\x99 test to determine if an adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d involves an exercise of judicial power.  <i>Oil States</i>, 584 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 15).  On the contrary, we have frequently repudiated this mode of analysis as utterly inadequate to police separation-of-powers disputes.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>INS</i> v. <i>Chadha</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919, 953, n.\xc2\xa016 (1983); <i>Arlington</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>Gordon</i>, 117 U.\xc2\xa0S. Appx., at 699.  In fact, of all the cases on which the majority relies, not a single one suggests that our appellate jurisdiction turns on the extent to which the underlying tribunal looks like a court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clooks like\xe2\x80\x9d test fails on its own terms.  It is certainly true that today\xe2\x80\x99s military justice system provides many protections for the accused and is staffed by officers who perform their duties diligently, responsibly, and with an appropriate degree of independence.  Nothing I say about the current system should be interpreted as denigrating that system or as impugning the dedication, professionalism, and integrity of the offi- cers who serve in it, notwithstanding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s insistence to the contrary.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11, n.\xc2\xa05.  As explained above, military officers\xe2\x80\x99 undoubted fidelity to law has nothing to do with the court-martial system\xe2\x80\x99s status under our Constitution.  That status is what my point here concerns.  And that status has never changed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s court-martial system was put in place in 1950, when Congress enacted the UCMJ in response to criticism following World War II.\n\n64Stat.\n108.  Among its innovations, the UCMJ subjected courts-martial to more elaborate procedural rules than ever before.  It also created a system of internal appellate tribunals within the military chain of command.  Those entities\xe2\x80\x94which we now call the Army, Navy-Marine Corps, Air Force, and Coast Guard Courts of Criminal Appeals and the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces\xe2\x80\x94did not exist before 1950.  Congress augmented this system in 1983, for the first time in American history providing for direct Supreme Court review of certain decisions of the highest military tribunal.\n\n97Stat.\n1405\xe2\x80\x931406;\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7867a;\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71259.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Such reforms, as I have indicated, are fully consistent with the President\xe2\x80\x99s overriding duty to \xe2\x80\x9cfaithfully execut[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the laws.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73.  Hence, even after Congress passed the UCMJ, we continued to recognize that the court-martial system \xe2\x80\x9chas always been and continues to be primarily an instrument of discipline,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Callahan</i> v. <i>Parker</i>,\n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258, 266 (1969), and that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts-martial are constitutional instruments to carry out congressional and executive will,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Palmore</i>, 411 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404; see also, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Reid</i>, 354 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 36 (plurality opinion); <i>United States ex rel.

For that reason, even if the majority were to begin its analysis in 1950, and to confine it to the CAAF\xe2\x80\x94which the majority has <i>not </i>done\xe2\x80\x94it would still be incorrect to perceive anything other than executive power at issue here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An examination of the CAAF confirms this point.  The CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s members are appointed by the President for a term of years, and he may remove them for cause, 10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7942(b), (c), under a standard we have recognized as \xe2\x80\x9cvery broad,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Bowsher</i> v. <i>Synar</i>,\n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714, 729 (1986).  These and other provisions of the UCMJ \xe2\x80\x9cmake clear that [the CAAF] is within the Executive Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Edmond</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651, 664, n.\xc2\xa02 (1997).  For instance, the CAAF is subject to oversight by the Secretaries of Defense, Homeland Security, and the military departments, and its members must meet annually to discuss their work with members of the military and appointees of the Secretary of Defense.\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7946.  The CAAF must review any case a Judge Advocate General orders it to hear.  \xc2\xa7867(a)(2).  And, contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s decisions are not \xe2\x80\x9cfinal (except if we review and reverse them).\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 18.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In fact, in the most serious cases that the CAAF reviews\xe2\x80\x94those in which a court-martial imposes a sentence of death or dismissal from the Armed Forces\xe2\x80\x94the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s judgment cannot be executed until the President, the relevant branch Secretary, or one of his subordinates approves it.  10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7871(a), (b).  That is why the UCMJ provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]fter [the CAAF] has acted on a case,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cconvening authority [shall] take action in accordance with that decision,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c<i>unless there is to be further action by the President or the Secretary concerned</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7867(e) (emphasis added).  In such cases the \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings, findings, and sentences\xe2\x80\x9d of the court-martial system\xe2\x80\x94including the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cappellate review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are not final until approved.  \xc2\xa7876.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Indeed, even if <i>our</i> Court affirms such a judgment, it cannot be executed until the relevant military authority approves it\xe2\x80\x94a requirement that is not subject to any timeframe or substantive standards.

And because the UCMJ preserves the chain of command\xe2\x80\x99s historic revisory power over the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s most significant decisions, there is no way for us to conclude that the CAAF is \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial\xe2\x80\x9d under any known definition of that term.  And it should not matter that Ortiz\xe2\x80\x99s own sentence is not subject to approval, just as it did not matter that the Court of Claims decision at issue in <i>Gordon</i> was not subject to review by the Treasury Secretary.  This point is elementary.  At least since <i>Hayburn\xe2\x80\x99s Case</i>, 2 Dall., at 411, n., 413, n., it has been firmly established that it is \xe2\x80\x9cradically inconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d with the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial power\xe2\x80\x9d for any court\xe2\x80\x99s judgments, \xe2\x80\x9cunder any circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cbe liable to a reversion, or even suspension,\xe2\x80\x9d by members of the Executive or Legislative Branches<i>.</i>  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he award of execution is a part, and an essential part of every judgment passed by a court exercising judicial power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gordon</i>, 117 U.\xc2\xa0S. Appx., at 702; <i>Plaut</i> v. <i>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211, 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Simply put, the CAAF\xe2\x80\x99s Executive Branch status is more than a label.  The CAAF is what we have always thought it to be: an agent of executive power to aid the Commander in Chief.  It follows that our appellate jurisdiction does not permit us to review its decisions directly.  That conclusion is unaffected by Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to give greater procedural protections to members of the military.  Nor would the conclusion be altered if Congress imported into the military justice system additional rights and procedures required in the civilian courts.  If Congress wants us to review CAAF decisions, it can convert that tribunal into an Article III court or it can make CAAF decisions reviewable first in a lower federal court\xe2\x80\x94perhaps one of the regional Courts of Appeals or the Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x94with additional review available here.  But as long as the CAAF retains its current status as an Executive Branch entity, Congress cannot give our Court jurisdiction to review its decisions directly.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The arguments in this case might appear technical, but important interests are at stake.  The division between our Court\xe2\x80\x99s original and appellate jurisdiction provoked extended and impassioned debate at the time of the founding.  See Amar, <i>Marbury</i>, Section 13, and the Original Jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, 56 U. Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 443, 468\xe2\x80\x93478 (1989).  The Framers well understood that the resolution of this dry jurisdictional issue would have practical effects, <i>ibid.</i>, and in a similar vein, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the CAAF exercises something akin to judicial power will have unavoidable implications for many important issues that may arise regarding the operation of the military justice system, not to mention judicial review of the many decisions handed down by administrative agencies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority disclaims the latter possibility,<i> ante,</i> at 19, but its effort is halfhearted at best.  In reality there is no relevant distinction, so far as our appellate jurisdiction is concerned, between the court-martial system and the \xe2\x80\x9cother adjudicative bodies in the Executive Branch\xe2\x80\x9d that the majority tells us not to worry about.  <i>Ibid</i>.  The majority cites the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial character .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of the court-martial system,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as its \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional foundations and history,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>, but as I have explained, the constitutional foundations, history, and fundamental character of military tribunals show that they are Executive Branch entities that can only permissibly exercise executive power\xe2\x80\x94just like civilian administrative agencies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Founders erected a high wall around our original jurisdiction, deliberately confining it to two classes of cases that were unlikely to touch the lives of most people.  See The Federalist No. 81, at\xc2\xa0488.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision erodes that wall.  Because the Court ignores both the wisdom of the Founders, the clear, consistent teaching of our precedents, and the unambiguous text of the Constitution, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Letter from Thomas Jefferson to Henry Knox (Mar. 27, 1801), in 33 Papers of Thomas Jefferson 465, 466 (B.

Seeing no need to revisit these precedents, I would not disturb them.
