JUSTICE DOUGLAS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Appellant Griswold is Executive Director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut.  Appellant Buxton is a licensed physician and a professor at the Yale Medical School who served as Medical Director for the League at its Center in New Haven -- a center open and operating from November 1 to November 10, 1961, when appellants were arrested.</p>\n<p>They gave information, instruction, and medical advice to <em>married persons</em> as to the means of preventing conception.  They examined the wife and prescribed the best contraceptive device or material for her use.  Fees were usually charged, although some couples were serviced free.</p>\n<p>The statutes whose constitutionality is involved in this appeal are \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 53-32 and 54-196 of the General Statutes of Connecticut (1958 rev.).  The former provides:</p>\n<p>"Any person who uses any drug, medicinal article or instrument for the purpose of preventing conception shall be fined not less than fifty dollars or imprisoned not less than sixty days nor more than one year or be both fined and imprisoned."</p>\n<p>Section 54-196 provides:</p>\n<p>"Any person who assists, abets, counsels, causes, hires or commands another to commit any offense may be prosecuted and punished as if he were the principal offender."</p>\n<p>The appellants were found guilty as accessories and fined $100 each, against the claim that the accessory statute, as so applied, violated the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Appellate Division of the Circuit Court affirmed.  The Supreme Court of Errors affirmed that judgment.  151 Conn. 544, 200 A.2d 479.  We noted probable jurisdiction.  379 U.S. 926. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 381 U. S. 481</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We think that appellants have standing to raise the constitutional rights of the married people with whom they had a professional relationship.  <em>Tileston v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/44/case.html">318 U. S. 44</a></span>, is different, for there the plaintiff seeking to represent others asked for a declaratory Judgment.  In that situation, we thought that the requirements of standing should be strict, lest the standards of "case or controversy" in Article III of the Constitution become blurred.  Here, those doubts are removed by reason of a criminal conviction for serving married couples in violation of an aiding-and-abetting statute.  Certainly the accessory should have standing to assert that the offense which he is charged with assisting is not, or cannot constitutionally be, a crime.</p>\n<p>This case is more akin to <em>Truax v. Raich,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/239/33/case.html">239 U. S. 33</a></span>, where an employee was permitted to assert the rights of his employer; to <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html">268 U. S. 510</a></span>, where the owners of private schools were entitled to assert the rights of potential pupils and their parents, and to <em>Barrows v. Jackson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/346/249/case.html">346 U. S. 249</a></span>, where a white defendant, party to a racially restrictive covenant, who was being sued for damages by the covenantors because she had conveyed her property to Negroes, was allowed to raise the issue that enforcement of the covenant violated the rights of prospective Negro purchasers to equal protection, although no Negro was a party to the suit.  <em>And see Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/case.html">262 U. S. 390</a></span>; <em>Adler v.

The rights of husband and wife, pressed here, are likely to be diluted or adversely affected unless those rights are considered in a suit involving those who have this kind of confidential relation to them.</p>\n<p>Coming to the merits, we are met with a wide range of questions that implicate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Overtones of some arguments </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 381 U. S. 482</a></p><p> suggest that <em>Lochner v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a></span>, should be our guide.  But we decline that invitation, as we did in <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/379/case.html">300 U. S. 379</a></span>; <em>Olsen v.

We do not sit as a super-legislature to determine the wisdom, need, and propriety of laws that touch economic problems, business affairs, or social conditions.  This law, however, operates directly on an intimate relation of husband and wife and their physician\'s role in one aspect of that relation.</p>\n<p>The association of people is not mentioned in the Constitution nor in the Bill of Rights.  The right to educate a child in a school of the parents\' choice -- whether public or private or parochial -- is also not mentioned.  Nor is the right to study any particular subject or any foreign language.  Yet the First Amendment has been construed to include certain of those rights.</p>\n<p>By <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters, supra,</em> the right to educate one\'s children as one chooses is made applicable to the States by the force of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  By <em>Meyer v. Nebraska, supra,</em> the same dignity is given the right to study the German language in a private school.  In other words, the State may not, consistently with the spirit of the First Amendment, contract the spectrum of available knowledge.  The right of freedom of speech and press includes not only the right to utter or to print, but the right to distribute, the right to receive, the right to read (<em>Martin v. Struthers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/141/case.html">319 U.

S. 483</a></p><p> those peripheral rights, the specific rights would be less secure.  And so we reaffirm the principle of the <em>Pierce</em> and the <em>Meyer</em> cases.</p>\n<p>In <em>NAACP v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html">357 U. S. 449</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/case.html#462">357 U. S. 462</a></span> we protected the "freedom to associate and privacy in one\'s associations," noting that freedom of association was a peripheral First Amendment right.  Disclosure of membership lists of a constitutionally valid association, we held, was invalid</p>\n<p>"as entailing the likelihood of a substantial restraint upon the exercise by petitioner\'s members of their right to freedom of association."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In other words, the First Amendment has a penumbra where privacy is protected from governmental intrusion.  In like context, we have protected forms of "association" that are not political in the customary sense, but pertain to the social, legal, and economic benefit of the members.  <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html#430">371 U. S. 430</a></span>-431.  In <em>Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/232/case.html">353 U. S. 232</a></span>, we held it not permissible to bar a lawyer from practice because he had once been a member of the Communist Party.  The man\'s "association with that Party" was not shown to be "anything more than a political faith in a political party" (<em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/232/case.html#244">353 U. S. 244</a></span>), and was not action of a kind proving bad moral character.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/353/232/case.html#245">353 U. S. 245</a></span>-246.</p>\n<p>Those cases involved more than the "right of assembly" -- a right that extends to all, irrespective of their race or ideology.  <em>De Jonge v. Oregon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/353/case.html">299 U. S. 353</a></span>.  The right of "association," like the right of belief (<em>Board of Education v. Barnette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/case.html">319 U. S. 624</a></span>), is more than the right to attend a meeting; it includes the right to express one\'s attitudes or philosophies by membership in a group or by affiliation with it or by other lawful means.  Association in that context is a form of expression of opinion, and, while it is not expressly included in the First Amendment, its existence is necessary in making the express guarantees fully meaningful. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 381 U. S. 484</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The foregoing cases suggest that specific guarantees in the Bill of Rights have penumbras, formed by emanations from those guarantees that help give them life and substance.  <em>See Poe v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#516">367 U. S. 516</a></span>-522 (dissenting opinion).  Various guarantees create zones of privacy.  The right of association contained in the penumbra of the First Amendment is one, as we have seen.  The Third Amendment, in its prohibition against the quartering of soldiers "in any house" in time of peace without the consent of the owner, is another facet of that privacy.  The Fourth Amendment explicitly affirms the "right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures."  The Fifth Amendment, in its Self-Incrimination Clause, enables the citizen to create a zone of privacy which government may not force him to surrender to his detriment.  The Ninth Amendment provides:  "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."</p>\n<p>The Fourth and Fifth Amendments were described in <em>Boyd v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html">116 U. S. 616</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html#630">116 U.

These cases bear witness that the right of privacy which presses for recognition here is a legitimate one.</p>\n<p>The present case, then, concerns a relationship lying within the zone of privacy created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees.  And it concerns a law which, in forbidding the use of contraceptives, rather than regulating their manufacture or sale, seeks to achieve its goals by means having a maximum destructive impact upon that relationship.  Such a law cannot stand in light of the familiar principle, so often applied by this Court, that a</p>\n<p>"governmental purpose to control or prevent activities constitutionally subject to state regulation may not be achieved by means which sweep unnecessarily broadly and thereby invade the area of protected freedoms."</p>\n<p>NAACP v. Alabama, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/288/case.html">377 U. S. 288</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/288/case.html#307">377 U.

The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 381 U. S. 486</a></p><p> very idea is repulsive to the notions of privacy surrounding the marriage relationship.</p>\n<p>We deal with a right of privacy older than the Bill of Rights -- older than our political parties, older than our school system.  Marriage is a coming together for better or for worse, hopefully enduring, and intimate to the degree of being sacred.  It is an association that promotes a way of life, not causes; a harmony in living, not political faiths; a bilateral loyalty, not commercial or social projects.  Yet it is an association for as noble a purpose as any involved in our prior decisions.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>* The Court said in full about this right of privacy:</p>\n<p>"The principles laid down in this opinion [by Lord Camden in <em>Entick v. Carrington,</em> 19 How.St.Tr. 1029] affect the very essence of constitutional liberty and security.  They reach farther than the concrete form of the case then before the court, with its adventitious circumstances; they apply to all invasions on the part of the government and its employes of the sanctity of a man\'s home and the privacies of life.  It is not the breaking of his doors, and the rummaging of his drawers, that constitutes the essence of the offence; but it is the invasion of his indefeasible right of personal security, personal liberty and private property, where that right has never been forfeited by his conviction of some public offence -- it is the invasion of this sacred right which underlies and constitutes the essence of Lord Camden\'s judgment.  Breaking into a house and opening boxes and drawers are circumstances of aggravation; but any forcible and compulsory extortion of a man\'s own testimony or of his private papers to be used as evidence to convict him of crime or to forfeit his goods is within the condemnation of that judgment.  In this regard, the Fourth and Fifth Amendments run almost into each other."</p>\n<p>116 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html#630">116 U.

JUSTICE BRENNAN join, concurring.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court that Connecticut\'s birth control law unconstitutionally intrudes upon the right of marital privacy, and I join in its opinion and judgment.  Although I have not accepted the view that "due process," as used in the Fourteenth Amendment, incorporates all of the first eight Amendments (<em>see</em> my concurring opinion in <em>Pointer v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html">380 U. S. 400</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html#410">380 U.

S. 154</a></span>), I do agree that the concept of liberty protects those personal rights that are fundamental, and is not confined to the specific terms of the Bill of Rights.  My conclusion that the concept of liberty is not so restricted, and that it embraces the right of marital privacy, though that right is not mentioned explicitly in the Constitution, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] is supported both by numerous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 381 U. S. 487</a></p><p> decisions of this Court, referred to in the Court\'s opinion, and by the language and history of the Ninth Amendment.  In reaching the conclusion that the right of marital privacy is protected as being within the protected penumbra of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights, the Court refers to the Ninth Amendment, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#484">381 U.

[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The language and history of the Ninth Amendment reveal that the Framers of the Constitution believed that there are additional fundamental rights, protected from governmental infringement, which exist alongside those fundamental rights specifically mentioned in the first eight constitutional amendments.  The Ninth Amendment reads, "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."  The Amendment is almost entirely the work of James Madison.  It was introduced in Congress by him, and passed the House and Senate with little or no debate and virtually no change in language.  It was proffered to quiet expressed fears that a bill of specifically enumerated rights [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] could not be sufficiently broad to cover all essential </p><p><a class="page-number" name="489">Page 381 U. S. 489</a></p><p> rights, and that the specific mention of certain rights would be interpreted as a denial that others were protected. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In presenting the proposed Amendment, Madison said:</p>\n<p>"It has been objected also against a bill of rights that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration, and it might follow, by implication, that those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure.  This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard urged against the admission of a bill of rights into this system, but I conceive that it may be guarded against.  I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="490">Page 381 U. S. 490</a></p><p> last clause of the fourth resolution [the Ninth Amendment]."</p>\n<p>I Annals of Congress 439 (Gales and Seaton ed. 1834).  Mr. Justice Story wrote of this argument against a bill of rights and the meaning of the Ninth Amendment:</p>\n<p>"In regard to . . . [a] suggestion, that the affirmance of certain rights might disparage others, or might lead to argumentative implications in favor of other powers, it might be sufficient to say that such a course of reasoning could never be sustained upon any solid basis. . . .  But a conclusive answer is that such an attempt may be interdicted (as it has been) by a positive declaration in such a bill of rights that the enumeration of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people."</p>\n<p>II Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States 626-627 (5th ed. 1891).  He further stated, referring to the Ninth Amendment:</p>\n<p>"This clause was manifestly introduced to prevent any perverse or ingenious misapplication of the well known maxim that an affirmation in particular cases implies a negation in all others, and, <em>e converso,</em> that a negation in particular cases implies an affirmation in all others."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 651.  These statements of Madison and Story make clear that the Framers did not intend that the first eight amendments be construed to exhaust the basic and fundamental rights which the Constitution guaranteed to the people. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>While this Court has had little occasion to interpret the Ninth Amendment, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] "[i]t cannot be presumed that any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 381 U.

The Ninth Amendment to the Constitution may be regarded by some as a recent discovery, and may be forgotten by others, but, since 1791, it has been a basic part of the Constitution which we are sworn to uphold.  To hold that a right so basic and fundamental and so deep-rooted in our society as the right of privacy in marriage may be infringed because that right is not guaranteed in so many words by the first eight amendments to the Constitution is to ignore the Ninth Amendment, and to give it no effect whatsoever.  Moreover, a judicial construction that this fundamental right is not protected by the Constitution because it is not mentioned in explicit terms by one of the first eight amendments or elsewhere in the Constitution would violate the Ninth Amendment, which specifically states that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 381 U. S. 492</a></p><p> "[t]he enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be <em>construed</em> to deny or disparage others retained by the people."  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>A dissenting opinion suggests that my interpretation of the Ninth Amendment somehow "broaden[s] the powers of this Court."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#520">381 U. S. 520</a></span>.  With all due respect, I believe that it misses the import of what I am saying.  I do not take the position of my Brother BLACK in his dissent in <em>Adamson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/case.html">332 U. S. 46</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/case.html#68">332 U. S. 68</a></span>, that the entire Bill of Rights is incorporated in the Fourteenth Amendment, and I do not mean to imply that the Ninth Amendment is applied against the States by the Fourteenth.  Nor do I mean to state that the Ninth Amendment constitutes an independent source of rights protected from infringement by either the States or the Federal Government.  Rather, the Ninth Amendment shows a belief of the Constitution\'s authors that fundamental rights exist that are not expressly enumerated in the first eight amendments, and an intent that the list of rights included there not be deemed exhaustive.  As any student of this Court\'s opinions knows, this Court has held, often unanimously, that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments protect certain fundamental personal liberties from abridgment by the Federal Government or the States.  <em>See, e.g., Bolling v. Sharpe,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/497/case.html">347 U. S. 497</a></span>; <em>Aptheker v.

Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>.  The Ninth Amendment simply shows the intent of the Constitution\'s authors that other fundamental personal rights should not be denied such protection or disparaged in any other way simply because they are not specifically listed in the first eight constitutional amendments.  I do not see how this broadens the authority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 381 U. S. 493</a></p><p> of the Court; rather it serves to support what this Court has been doing in protecting fundamental rights.</p>\n<p>Nor am I turning somersaults with history in arguing that the Ninth Amendment is relevant in a case dealing with a State\'s infringement of a fundamental right.  While the Ninth Amendment -- and indeed the entire Bill of Rights -- originally concerned restrictions upon federal power, the subsequently enacted Fourteenth Amendment prohibits the States as well from abridging fundamental personal liberties.  And the Ninth Amendment, in indicating that not all such liberties are specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments, is surely relevant in showing the existence of other fundamental personal rights, now protected from state, as well as federal, infringement.  In sum, the Ninth Amendment simply lends strong support to the view that the "liberty" protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments from infringement by the Federal Government or the States is not restricted to rights specifically mentioned in the first eight amendments.  <em>Cf. United Public Workers v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/75/case.html">330 U. S. 75</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">330 U.

Rather, they must look to the "traditions and [collective] conscience of our people" to determine whether a principle is "so rooted [there] . . . as to be ranked as fundamental."  <em>Snyder v.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 381 U.

Of this whole \'private realm of family life,\' it is difficult to imagine what is more private or more intimate than a husband and wife\'s marital relations."</p>\n<p>The entire fabric of the Constitution and the purposes that clearly underlie its specific guarantees demonstrate that the rights to marital privacy and to marry and raise a family are of similar order and magnitude as the fundamental rights specifically protected.</p>\n<p>Although the Constitution does not speak in so many words of the right of privacy in marriage, I cannot believe that it offers these fundamental rights no protection.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]"</p>\n<p>The vice of the dissenters\' views is that it would permit such experimentation by the States in the area of the fundamental personal rights of its citizens.  I cannot agree that the Constitution grants such power either to the States or to the Federal Government.</p>\n<p>The logic of the dissents would sanction federal or state legislation that seems to me even more plainly unconstitutional than the statute before us.  Surely the Government, absent a showing of a compelling subordinating state interest, could not decree that all husbands and wives must be sterilized after two children have been born </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 381 U. S. 497</a></p><p> to them.  Yet, by their reasoning, such an invasion of marital privacy would not be subject to constitutional challenge, because, while it might be "silly," no provision of the Constitution specifically prevents the Government from curtailing the marital right to bear children and raise a family.  While it may shock some of my Brethren that the Court today holds that the Constitution protects the right of marital privacy, in my view, it is far more shocking to believe that the personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution does not include protection against such totalitarian limitation of family size, which is at complete variance with our constitutional concepts.  Yet if, upon a showing of a slender basis of rationality, a law outlawing voluntary birth control by married persons is valid, then, by the same reasoning, a law requiring compulsory birth control also would seem to be valid.  In my view, however, both types of law would unjustifiably intrude upon rights of marital privacy which are constitutionally protected.</p>\n<p>In a long series of cases, this Court has held that, where fundamental personal liberties are involved, they may not be abridged by the States simply on a showing that a regulatory statute has some rational relationship to the effectuation of a proper state purpose.</p>\n<p>"Where there is a significant encroachment upon personal liberty, the State may prevail only upon showing a subordinating interest which is compelling,"</p>\n<p><em>Bates v.

S. 498</a></p><p> . . . to the accomplishment of a permissible state policy."  The State, at most, argues that there is some rational relation between this statute and what is admittedly a legitimate subject of state concern -- the discouraging of extramarital relations.  It says that preventing the use of birth control devices by married persons helps prevent the indulgence by some in such extramarital relations.  The rationality of this justification is dubious, particularly in light of the admitted widespread availability to all persons in the State of Connecticut. unmarried as well as married, of birth control devices for the prevention of disease, as distinguished from the prevention of conception, <em>see Tileston v. Ullman,</em> 129 Conn. 84, 26 A.2d 582.  But, in any event, it is clear that the state interest in safeguarding marital fidelity can be served by a more discriminately tailored statute which does not, like the present one, sweep unnecessarily broadly, reaching far beyond the evil sought to be dealt with and intruding upon the privacy of all married couples.  <em>See Aptheker v.

It is one thing when the State exerts its power either to forbid extramarital sexuality . . . or to say who may marry, but it is quite another when, having acknowledged a marriage and the intimacies inherent in it, it undertakes to regulate by means of the criminal law the details of that intimacy."</p>\n<p>In sum, I believe that the right of privacy in the marital relation is fundamental and basic -- a personal right "retained by the people" within the meaning of the Ninth Amendment.

For why declare that things shall not be done which there is no power to do?  Why, for instance, should it be said that the liberty of the press shall not be restrained when no power is given by which restrictions may be imposed?

The right claimed as inviolate may be stated as the right of a citizen to act as a party official or worker to further his own political views.  Thus, we have a measure of interference by the Hatch Act and the Rules with what otherwise would be the freedom of the civil servant under the First, Ninth and Tenth Amendments.

In fact, a hesitancy to allow too broad a discretion was a substantial reason leading me to conclude, in <em>Pointer v. Texas, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html#413">380 U. S. 413</a></span>-414, that those rights absorbed by the Fourteenth Amendment and applied to the States because they are fundamental apply with equal force and to the same extent against both federal and state governments.  In <em>Pointer,</em> I said that the contrary view would require</p>\n<p>"this Court to make the extremely subjective and excessively discretionary determination as to whether a practice, forbidden the Federal Government by a fundamental constitutional guarantee, is, as viewed in the factual circumstances surrounding each individual case, sufficiently repugnant to the notion of due process as to be forbidden the States."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html#413">380 U.

JUSTICE HARLAN, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>I fully agree with the judgment of reversal, but find myself unable to join the Court\'s opinion.  The reason is that it seems to me to evince an approach to this case very much like that taken by my Brothers BLACK and STEWART in dissent, namely:  the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not touch this Connecticut statute unless the enactment is found to violate some right assured by the letter or penumbra of the Bill of Rights. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="500">Page 381 U. S. 500</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In other words, what I find implicit in the Court\'s opinion is that the "incorporation" doctrine may be used to restrict the reach of Fourteenth Amendment Due Process.  For me, this is just as unacceptable constitutional doctrine as is the use of the "incorporation" approach to impose upon the States all the requirements of the Bill of Rights as found in the provisions of the first eight amendments and in the decisions of this Court interpreting them.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> my concurring opinions in <em>Pointer v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html">380 U. S. 400</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html#408">380 U.

S. 539</a></span>-545.</p>\n<p>In my view, the proper constitutional inquiry in this case is whether this Connecticut statute infringes the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment because the enactment violates basic values "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," <em>Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html#325">302 U. S. 325</a></span>.  For reasons stated at length in my dissenting opinion in <em>Poe v. Ullman, supra,</em> I believe that it does.  While the relevant inquiry may be aided by resort to one or more of the provisions of the Bill of Rights, it is not dependent on them or any of their radiations.  The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment stands, in my opinion, on its own bottom.</p>\n<p>A further observation seems in order respecting the justification of my Brothers BLACK and STEWART for their "incorporation" approach to this case.  Their approach does not rest on historical reasons, which are, of course, wholly lacking (<em>see</em> Fairman, Does the Fourteenth Amendment Incorporate the Bill of Rights?  The Original Understanding, 2 Stan.L.Rev. 5 (1949)), but on the thesis that, by limiting the content of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the protection of rights which can be found elsewhere in the Constitution, in this instance, in the Bill of Rights, judges will thus be confined to "interpretation" of specific constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="501">Page 381 U. S. 501</a></p><p> provisions, and will thereby be restrained from introducing their own notions of constitutional right and wrong into the "vague contours of the Due Process Clause."  <em>Rochin v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/165/case.html">342 U. S. 165</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/165/case.html#170">342 U. S. 170</a></span>. While I could not more heartily agree that judicial "self-restraint" is an indispensable ingredient of sound constitutional adjudication, I do submit that the formula suggested for achieving it is more hollow than real.  "Specific" provisions of the Constitution, no less than "due process," lend themselves as readily to "personal" interpretations by judges whose constitutional outlook is simply to keep the Constitution in supposed "tune with the times" (post, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#522">381 U. S. 522</a></span>).  Need one go further than to recall last Term\'s reapportionment cases, <em>Wesberry v. Sanders,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/case.html">376 U. S. 1</a></span>, and <em>Reynolds v. Sims,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/case.html">377 U. S. 533</a></span>, where a majority of the Court "interpreted" "by the People" (Art. I, \xc2\xa7 2) and "equal protection" (Amdt. 14) to command "one person, one vote," an interpretation that was made in the face of irrefutable and still unanswered history to the contrary?  <em>See</em> my dissenting opinions in those cases, 376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/case.html#20">376 U. S. 20</a></span>; 377 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">377 U. S. 589</span>.</p>\n<p>Judicial self-restraint will not, I suggest, be brought about in the "due process" area by the historically unfounded incorporation formula long advanced by my Brother BLACK, and now in part espoused by my Brother STEWART.  It will be achieved in this area, as in other constitutional areas, only by continual insistence upon respect for the teachings of history, solid recognition of the basic values that underlie our society, and wise appreciation of the great roles that the doctrines of federalism and separation of powers have played in establishing and preserving American freedoms.  <em>See Adamson v.

Adherence to these principles will not, of course, obviate all constitutional differences of opinion among judges, nor should it.  Their continued recognition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 381 U. S. 502</a></p><p> will, however, go farther toward keeping most judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field than will the interpolation into the Constitution of an artificial and largely illusory restriction on the content of the Due Process Clause.<l=>*</l=></p>\n<p>* Indeed, my Brother BLACK, in arguing his thesis, is forced to lay aside a host of cases in which the Court has recognized fundamental rights in the Fourteenth Amendment without specific reliance upon the Bill of Rights.  <em>Post,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#512">381 U. S. 512</a></span>, n. 4.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE WHITE, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>In my view, this Connecticut law, as applied to married couples, deprives them of "liberty" without due process of law, as that concept is used in the Fourteenth Amendment.  I therefore concur in the judgment of the Court reversing these convictions under Connecticut\'s aiding and abetting statute.</p>\n<p>It would be unduly repetitious, and belaboring the obvious, to expound on the impact of this statute on the liberty guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment against arbitrary or capricious denials or on the nature of this liberty.  Suffice it to say that this is not the first time this Court has had occasion to articulate that the liberty entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment includes the right "to marry, establish a home and bring up children," <em>Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/case.html">262 U.

Surely the right invoked in this case, to be free of regulation of the intimacies of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 381 U.

S. 95</a></span> (opinion of Frankfurter, J.).</p>\n<p>The Connecticut anti-contraceptive statute deals rather substantially with this relationship.  For it forbids all married persons the right to use birth control devices, regardless of whether their use is dictated by considerations of family planning, <em>Trubek v. Ullman,</em> 147 Conn. 633, 165 A.2d 158, health, or indeed even of life itself.  <em>Buxton v. Ullman,</em> 147 Conn. 48, 156 A.2d 508.  The anti-use statute, together with the general aiding and abetting statute, prohibits doctors from affording advice to married persons on proper and effective methods of birth control.  <em>Tileston v. Ullman,</em> 129 Conn. 84, 26 A.2d 582.  And the clear effect of these statutes, as enforced, is to deny disadvantaged citizens of Connecticut, those without either adequate knowledge or resources to obtain private counseling, access to medical assistance and up-to-date information in respect to proper methods of birth control.  <em>State v. Nelson,</em> 126 Conn. 412, 11 A.2d 856; <em>State v. Griswold,</em> 151 Conn. 544, 200 A.2d 479.

There is no serious contention that Connecticut thinks the use of artificial or external methods of contraception immoral or unwise in itself, or that the anti-use statute is founded upon any policy of promoting population expansion.  Rather, the statute is said to serve the State\'s policy against all forms of promiscuous or illicit sexual relationships, be they premarital or extramarital, concededly a permissible and legitimate legislative goal.</p>\n<p>Without taking issue with the premise that the fear of conception operates as a deterrent to such relationships in addition to the criminal proscriptions Connecticut has against such conduct, I wholly fail to see how the ban on the use of contraceptives by married couples in any way reinforces the State\'s ban on illicit sexual relationships.  <em>See Schware v.

Connecticut does not bar the importation or possession of contraceptive devices; they are not considered contraband material under state law, <em>State v. Certain Contraceptive Materials,</em> 126 Conn. 428, 11 A.2d 863, and their availability in that State is not seriously disputed.  The only way Connecticut seeks to limit or control the availability of such devices is through its general aiding and abetting statute, whose operation in this context has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 381 U.

Indeed, after over 80 years of the State\'s proscription of use, the legality of the sale of such devices to prevent disease has never been expressly passed upon, although it appears that sales have long occurred and have only infrequently been challenged.  This "undeviating policy . . . throughout all the long years . . . bespeaks more than prosecutorial paralysis."  <em>Poe v. Ullman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html">367 U. S. 497</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/497/case.html#502">367 U. S. 502</a></span>.  Moreover, it would appear that the sale of contraceptives to prevent disease is plainly legal under Connecticut law.</p>\n<p>In these circumstances, one is rather hard pressed to explain how the ban on use by married persons in any way prevents use of such devices by persons engaging in illicit sexual relations, and thereby contributes to the State\'s policy against such relationships.  Neither the state courts nor the State before the bar of this Court has tendered such an explanation.  It is purely fanciful to believe that the broad proscription on use facilitates discovery of use by persons engaging in a prohibited relationship, or for some other reason makes such use more unlikely, and thus can be supported by any sort of administrative consideration.  Perhaps the theory is that the flat ban on use prevents married people from possessing contraceptives and, without the ready availability of such devices for use in the marital relationship, there will be no or less temptation to use them in extramarital ones.  This reasoning rests on the premise that married people will comply with the ban in regard to their marital relationship, notwithstanding total nonenforcement in this context and apparent nonenforcibility, but will not comply with criminal statutes prohibiting extramarital affairs and the anti-use statute in respect to illicit sexual relationships, a premise whose validity has not been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 381 U. S. 507</a></p><p> demonstrated and whose intrinsic validity is not very evident.  At most, the broad ban is of marginal utility to the declared objective.  A statute limiting its prohibition on use to persons engaging in the prohibited relationship would serve the end posited by Connecticut in the same way, and with the same effectiveness or ineffectiveness, as the broad anti-use statute under attack in this case.  I find nothing in this record justifying the sweeping scope of this statute, with its telling effect on the freedoms of married persons, and therefore conclude that it deprives such persons of liberty without due process of law.</p>\n<p>* Dissenting opinions assert that the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause is limited to a guarantee against unduly vague statutes and against procedural unfairness at trial.  Under this view, the Court is without authority to ascertain whether a challenged statute, or its application, has a permissible purpose, and whether the manner of regulation bears a rational or justifying relationship to this purpose.  A long line of cases makes very clear that this has not been the view of this Court.  <em>Dent v. West Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/129/114/case.html">129 U.

And, like him, I do not to any extent whatever base my view that this Connecticut law is constitutional on a belief that the law is wise, or that its policy is a good one.  In order that there may be no room at all to doubt why I vote as I do, I feel constrained to add that the law is every bit as offensive to me as it is to my Brethren of the majority and my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG, who, reciting reasons why it is offensive to them, hold it unconstitutional.  There is no single one of the graphic and eloquent strictures and criticisms fired at the policy of this Connecticut law either by the Court\'s opinion or by those of my concurring Brethren to which I cannot subscribe -- except their conclusion that the evil qualities they see in the law make it unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Had the doctor defendant here, or even the nondoctor defendant, been convicted for doing nothing more than expressing opinions to persons coming to the clinic that certain contraceptive devices, medicines or practices would do them good and would be desirable, or for telling people how devices could be used, I can think of no reasons at this time why their expressions of views would not be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 381 U.

But speech is one thing; conduct and physical activities are quite another.  <em>See, e.g., Cox v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/536/case.html">379 U.

The two defendants here were active participants in an organization which gave physical examinations to women, advised them what kind of contraceptive devices or medicines would most likely be satisfactory for them, and then supplied the devices themselves, all for a graduated scale of fees, based on the family income.  Thus, these defendants admittedly engaged with others in a planned course of conduct to help people violate the Connecticut law.  Merely because some speech was used in carrying on that conduct -- just as, in ordinary life, some speech accompanies most kinds of conduct -- we are not, in my view, justified in holding that the First Amendment forbids the State to punish their conduct.  Strongly as I desire to protect all First Amendment freedoms, I am unable to stretch the Amendment so as to afford protection to the conduct of these defendants in violating the Connecticut law.  What would be the constitutional fate of the law if hereafter applied to punish nothing but speech is, as I have said, quite another matter.  The Court talks about a constitutional "right of privacy" as though there is some constitutional provision or provisions forbidding any law ever to be passed which might abridge the "privacy" of individuals.  But there is not.  There are, of course, guarantees in certain specific constitutional provisions which are designed in part to protect privacy at certain times and places with respect to certain activities.  Such, for example, is the Fourth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 381 U. S. 509</a></p><p> Amendment\'s guarantee against "unreasonable searches and seizures."  But I think it belittles that Amendment to talk about it as though it protects nothing but "privacy."  To treat it that way is to give it a niggardly interpretation, not the kind of liberal reading I think any Bill of Rights provision should be given.  The average man would very likely not have his feelings soothed any more by having his property seized openly than by having it seized privately and by stealth.  He simply wants his property left alone.  And a person can be just as much, if not more, irritated, annoyed and injured by an unceremonious public arrest by a policeman as he is by a seizure in the privacy of his office or home.</p>\n<p>One of the most effective ways of diluting or expanding a constitutionally guaranteed right is to substitute for the crucial word or words of a constitutional guarantee another word or words, more or less flexible and more or less restricted in meaning.  This fact is well illustrated by the use of the term "right of privacy" as a comprehensive substitute for the Fourth Amendment\'s guarantee against "unreasonable searches and seizures."  "Privacy" is a broad, abstract and ambiguous concept which can easily be shrunken in meaning but which can also, on the other hand, easily be interpreted as a constitutional ban against many things other than searches and seizures.  I have expressed the view many times that First Amendment freedoms, for example, have suffered from a failure of the courts to stick to the simple language of the First Amendment in construing it, instead of invoking multitudes of words substituted for those the Framers used.  <em>See, e.g., New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html">376 U. S. 254</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/254/case.html#293">376 U. S. 293</a></span> (concurring opinion); cases collected in <em>City of El Paso v. Simmons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/497/case.html">379 U.

S. 517</a></span>, n. 1 (dissenting opinion); Black, The Bill of Rights, 35 N.Y.U.L.Rev. 865.  For these reasons, I get nowhere in this case by talk about a constitutional "right of privacy" as an emanation from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 381 U. S. 510</a></p><p> one or more constitutional provisions. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  I like my privacy as well as the next one, but I am nevertheless compelled to admit that government has a right to. invade it unless prohibited by some specific constitutional provision.  For these reasons, I cannot agree with the Court\'s judgment and the reasons it gives for holding this Connecticut law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>This brings me to the arguments made by my Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG for invalidating the Connecticut law.  Brothers HARLAN [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and WHITE would invalidate it by reliance on the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, but Brother GOLDBERG, while agreeing with Brother HARLAN, relies also on the Ninth Amendment.  I have no doubt that the Connecticut law could be applied in such a way as to abridge freedom of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 381 U. S. 511</a></p><p> speech and press, and therefore violate the First and Fourteenth Amendments.  My disagreement with the Court\'s opinion holding that there is such a violation here is a narrow one, relating to the application of the First Amendment to the facts and circumstances of this particular case.  But my disagreement with Brothers HARLAN, WHITE and GOLDBERG is more basic.  I think that, if properly construed, neither the Due Process Clause nor the Ninth Amendment, nor both together, could under any circumstances be a proper basis for invalidating the Connecticut law.  I discuss the due process and Ninth Amendment arguments together because, on analysis, they turn out to be the same thing -- merely using different words to claim for this Court and the federal judiciary power to invalidate any legislative act which the judges find irrational, unreasonable or offensive.</p>\n<p>The due process argument which my Brothers HARLAN and WHITE adopt here is based, as their opinions indicate, on the premise that this Court is vested with power to invalidate all state laws that it considers to be arbitrary, capricious, unreasonable, or oppressive, or on this Court\'s belief that a particular state law under scrutiny has no "rational or justifying" purpose, or is offensive to a "sense of fairness and justice." [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  If these formulas based on "natural justice," or others which mean the same thing, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] are to prevail, they require judges to determine </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 381 U. S. 512</a></p><p> what is or is not constitutional on the basis of their own appraisal of what laws are unwise or unnecessary.  The power to make such decisions is, of course, that of a legislative body.  Surely it has to be admitted that no provision of the Constitution specifically gives such blanket power to courts to exercise such a supervisory veto over the wisdom and value of legislative policies and to hold unconstitutional those laws which they believe unwise or dangerous.  I readily admit that no legislative body, state or national, should pass laws that can justly be given any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 381 U. S. 513</a></p><p> of the invidious labels invoked as constitutional excuses to strike down state laws.  But perhaps it is not too much to say that no legislative body ever does pass laws without believing that they will accomplish a sane, rational, wise and justifiable purpose.  While I completely subscribe to the holding of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v. Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137, and subsequent cases, that our Court has constitutional power to strike down statutes, state or federal, that violate commands of the Federal Constitution, I do not believe that we are granted power by the Due Process Clause or any other constitutional provision or provisions to measure constitutionality by our belief that legislation is arbitrary, capricious or unreasonable, or accomplishes no justifiable purpose, or is offensive to our own notions of "civilized standards of conduct." [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Such an appraisal of the wisdom of legislation is an attribute of the power to make laws, not of the power to interpret them.  The use by federal courts of such a formula or doctrine or whatnot to veto federal or state laws simply takes away from Congress and States the power to make laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom, and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination -- a power which was specifically denied to federal courts by the convention that framed the Constitution. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 381 U. S. 514</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Of the cases on which my Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG rely so heavily, undoubtedly the reasoning of two of them supports their result here -- as would that of a number of others which they do not bother to name, <em>e.g.,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 381 U. S. 515</a></p><p> <em>Lochner v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a></span>, <em>Coppage v.

Children\'s Hospital,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/525/case.html">261 U. S. 525</a></span>.  The two they do cite and quote from, <em>Meyer v.

Society of Sisters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html">268 U. S. 510</a></span>, were both decided in opinions by Mr. Justice McReynolds which elaborated the same natural law due process philosophy found in <em>Lochner v. New York, supra,</em> one of the cases on which he relied in <em>Meyer,</em> along with such other long-discredited decisions as, <em>e.g., Adams v. Tanner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/244/590/case.html">244 U. S. 590</a></span>, and <em>Adkins v. Children\'s Hospital, supra.</em> <em>Meyer</em> held unconstitutional, as an "arbitrary" and unreasonable interference with the right of a teacher to carry on his occupation and of parents to hire him, a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 381 U. S. 516</a></p><p> state law forbidding the teaching of modern foreign languages to young children in the schools. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  And in <em>Pierce,</em> relying principally on <em>Meyer,</em> Mr. Justice McReynolds said that a state law requiring that all children attend public schools interfered unconstitutionally with the property rights of private school corporations because it was an "arbitrary, unreasonable and unlawful interference" which threatened "destruction of their business and property."  268 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/536/case.html">268 U. S. 536</a></span>.  Without expressing an opinion as to whether either of those cases reached a correct result in light of our later decisions applying the First Amendment to the States through the Fourteenth, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] I merely point out that the reasoning stated in <em>Meyer</em> and <em>Pierce</em> was the same natural law due process philosophy which many later opinions repudiated, and which I cannot accept.  Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG also cite other cases, such as <em>NAACP v. Button,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/371/415/case.html">371 U. S. 415</a></span>, <em>Shelton v.

[<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/1/case.html">Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen v.

[<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  Brothers WHITE and GOLDBERG now apparently would start from this requirement that laws be narrowly drafted so as not to curtail free speech and assembly, and extend it limitlessly to require States to justify any law restricting "liberty" as my Brethren define "liberty."  This would mean at the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 381 U. S. 518</a></p><p> very least, I suppose, that every state criminal statute -- since it must inevitably curtail "liberty" to some extent -- would be suspect, and would have to be Justified to this Court. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>My Brother GOLDBERG has adopted the recent discovery [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] that the Ninth Amendment as well as the Due Process Clause can be used by this Court as authority to strike down all state legislation which this Court thinks </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 381 U. S. 519</a></p><p> violates "fundamental principles of liberty and justice," or is contrary to the "traditions and [collective] conscience of our people."  He also states, without proof satisfactory to me, that, in making decisions on this basis, judges will not consider "their personal and private notions."  One may ask how they can avoid considering them.  Our Court certainly has no machinery with which to take a Gallup Poll. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  And the scientific miracles of this age have not yet produced a gadget which the Court can use to determine what traditions are rooted in the "[collective] conscience of our people."  Moreover, one would certainly have to look far beyond the language of the Ninth Amendment [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>] to find that the Framers vested in this Court any such awesome veto powers over lawmaking, either by the States or by the Congress.  Nor does anything in the history of the Amendment offer any support for such a shocking doctrine.  The whole history of the adoption of the Constitution and Bill of Rights points the other way, and the very material quoted by my Brother GOLDBERG shows that the Ninth Amendment was intended to protect against the idea that, "by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power" to the Federal Government, "those rights which were not singled out were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government [the United States], and were consequently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 381 U. S. 520</a></p><p> insecure." [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  That Amendment was passed not to broaden the powers of this Court or any other department of "the General Government," but, as every student of history knows, to assure the people that the Constitution in all its provisions was intended to limit the Federal Government to the powers granted expressly or by necessary implication.  If any broad, unlimited power to hold laws unconstitutional because they offend what this Court conceives to be the "[collective] conscience of our people" is vested in this Court by the Ninth Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, or any other provision of the Constitution, it was not given by the Framers, but rather has been bestowed on the Court by the Court.  This fact is perhaps responsible for the peculiar phenomenon that, for a period of a century and a half, no serious suggestion was ever made that the Ninth Amendment, enacted to protect state powers against federal invasion, could be used as a weapon of federal power to prevent state legislatures from passing laws they consider appropriate to govern local affairs.  Use of any such broad, unbounded judicial authority would make of this Court\'s members a day-to-day constitutional convention.</p>\n<p>I repeat, so as not to be misunderstood, that this Court does have power, which it should exercise, to hold laws unconstitutional where they are forbidden by the Federal Constitution.  My point is that there is no provision </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 381 U. S. 521</a></p><p> of the Constitution which either expressly or impliedly vests power in this Court to sit as a supervisory agency over acts of duly constituted legislative bodies and set aside their laws because of the Court\'s belief that the legislative policies adopted are unreasonable, unwise, arbitrary, capricious or irrational.  The adoption of such a loose flexible. uncontrolled standard for holding laws unconstitutional, if ever it is finally achieved, will amount to a great unconstitutional shift of power to the courts which I believe and am constrained to say will be bad for the courts, and worse for the country.  Subjecting federal and state laws to such an unrestrained and unrestrainable judicial control as to the wisdom of legislative enactments would, I fear, jeopardize the separation of governmental powers that the Framers set up, and, at the same time, threaten to take away much of the power of States to govern themselves which the Constitution plainly intended them to have. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 381 U. S. 522</a></p><p></p>\n<p>I realize that many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, sometimes in rhapsodical strains, about the duty of this Court to keep the Constitution in tune with the times.  The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes.  For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy.  The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it.  Amendments suggested by the people\'s elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification.  That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it is good enough for me.  And so I cannot rely on the Due Process Clause or the Ninth Amendment or any mysterious and uncertain natural law concept as a reason for striking down this state law.  The Due Process Clause, with an "arbitrary and capricious" or "shocking to the conscience" formula, was liberally used by this Court to strike down economic legislation in the early decades of this century, threatening, many people thought, the tranquility and stability of the Nation.  <em>See, e.g., Lochner v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a></span>.  That formula, based on subjective considerations of "natural justice," is no less dangerous when used to enforce this Court\'s views about personal rights than those about economic rights.  I had thought that we had laid that formula, as a means for striking down state legislation, to rest once and for all in cases like <em>West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/300/379/case.html">300 U. S. 379</a></span>; <em>Olsen v. Nebraska ex rel.

They would reinstate the <em>Lochner, Coppage, Adkins, Burns</em> line of cases, cases from which this Court recoiled after the 1930\'s, and which had been, I thought, totally discredited until now.  Apparently my Brethren have less quarrel with state economic regulations than former Justices of their persuasion had.  But any limitation upon their using the natural law due process philosophy to strike down any state law, dealing with any activity whatever, will obviously be only self-imposed. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]</p>\n<p>In 1798, when this Court was asked to hold another Connecticut law unconstitutional, Justice Iredell said:</p>\n<p>"[I]t has been the policy of all the <em>American states</em> which have individually framed their state constitutions since the revolution, and of the people of the <em>United States</em> when they framed the Federal Constitution, to define with precision the objects of the legislative power, and to restrain its exercise within marked and settled boundaries.  If any act of Congress, or of the Legislature of a state, violates those constitutional provisions, it is unquestionably void, though I admit that, as the authority to declare it void is of a delicate and awful nature, the Court will never resort to that authority but in a clear and urgent case.  If, on the other hand, the Legislature of the Union, or the Legislature of any member of the Union, shall pass a law within the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="525">Page 381 U. S. 525</a></p><p> general scope of their constitutional power, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice.  The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard:  the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject, and all that the Court could properly say in such an event would be that the Legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act which, in the opinion of the judges, was inconsistent with the abstract principles of natural justice."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/386/case.html">Calder v.

This process, of course, involves interpretation, and since words can have many meanings, interpretation obviously may result in contraction or extension of the original purpose of a constitutional provision, thereby affecting policy.

Warren and (later Mr. Justice) Brandeis in 1890 which urged that States should give some form of tort relief to persons whose private affairs were exploited by others.  The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv.L.Rev.193.  Largely as a result of this article, some States have passed statutes creating such a cause of action, and, in others, state courts have done the same thing by exercising their powers as courts of common law.  <em>See generally,</em> 41 Am.Jur. 926-927.  Thus, the Supreme Court of Georgia, in granting a cause of action for damages to a man whose picture had been used in a newspaper advertisement without his consent, said that "A right of privacy in matters purely private is . . . derived from natural law," and that</p>\n<p>"The conclusion reached by us seems to be . . . thoroughly in accord with natural justice, with the principles of the law of every civilized nation, and especially with the elastic principles of the common law. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Pavesich v.

Observing that "the right of privacy . . . presses for recognition here," today this Court, which I did not understand to have power to sit as a court of common law, now appears to be exalting a phrase which Warren and Brandeis used in discussing grounds for tort relief, to the level of a constitutional rule which prevents state legislatures from passing any law deemed by this Court to interfere with "privacy."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Brother HARLAN\'s views are spelled out at greater length in his dissenting opinion in <em>Poe v.

While Judge Hand condemned as unjustified the invalidation of state laws under the natural law due process formula, <em>see id.</em> at 35-45, he also expressed the view that this Court, in a number of cases, had gone too far in holding legislation to be in violation of specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights.  Although I agree with his criticism of use of the due process formula, I do not agree with all the views he expressed about construing the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STEWART, whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Since 1879, Connecticut has had on its books a law which forbids the use of contraceptives by anyone.  I think this is an uncommonly silly law.  As a practical matter, the law is obviously unenforceable, except in the oblique context of the present case.  As a philosophical matter, I believe the use of contraceptives in the relationship of marriage should be left to personal and private choice, based upon each individual\'s moral, ethical, and religious beliefs.  As a matter of social policy, I think professional counsel about methods of birth control should be available to all, so that each individual\'s choice can be meaningfully made.  But we are not asked in this case to say whether we think this law is unwise, or even asinine.  We are asked to hold that it violates the United States Constitution.  And that I cannot do.</p>\n<p>In the course of its opinion, the Court refers to no less than six Amendments to the Constitution:  the First, the Third, the Fourth, the Fifth, the Ninth, and the Fourteenth.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 381 U. S. 528</a></p><p> But the Court does not say which of these Amendments, if any, it thinks is infringed by this Connecticut law.</p>\n<p>We are told that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is not, as such, the "guide" in this case.  With that much, I agree.  There is no claim that this law, duly enacted by the Connecticut Legislature, is unconstitutionally vague.  There is no claim that the appellants were denied any of the elements of procedural due process at their trial, so as to make their convictions constitutionally invalid.  And, as the Court says, the day has long passed since the Due Process Clause was regarded as a proper instrument for determining "the wisdom, need, and propriety" of state laws.  <em>Compare Lochner v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a></span>, <em>with Ferguson v.

Skrupa, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/726/case.html#730">372 U. S. 730</a></span></p>\n<p>As to the First, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Amendments, I can find nothing in any of them to invalidate this Connecticut law, even assuming that all those Amendments are fully applicable against the States. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  It has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 381 U. S. 529</a></p><p> not even been argued that this is a law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof." [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  And surely, unless the solemn process of constitutional adjudication is to descend to the level of a play on words, there is not involved here any abridgment of</p>\n<p>"the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]"</p>\n<p>No soldier has been quartered in any house. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  There has been no search, and no seizure. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]  Nobody has been compelled to be a witness against himself. [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court also quotes the Ninth Amendment, and my Brother GOLDBERG\'s concurring opinion relies heavily upon it.  But to say that the Ninth Amendment has anything to do with this case is to turn somersaults with history.  The Ninth Amendment, like its companion, the Tenth, which this Court held "states but a truism that all is retained which has not been surrendered," <em>United States v. Darby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/case.html">312 U. S. 100</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/100/case.html#124">312 U. S. 124</a></span>, was framed by James Madison and adopted by the States simply to make clear that the adoption of the Bill of Rights did not alter the plan that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 381 U. S. 530</a></p><p> the <em>Federal</em> Government was to be a government of express and limited powers, and that all rights and powers not delegated to it were retained by the people and the individual States.  Until today, no member of this Court has ever suggested that the Ninth Amendment meant anything else, and the idea that a federal court could ever use the Ninth Amendment to annul a law passed by the elected representatives of the people of the State of Connecticut would have caused James Madison no little wonder.</p>\n<p>What provision of the Constitution, then, does make this state law invalid?  The Court says it is the right of privacy "created by several fundamental constitutional guarantees."  With all deference, I can find no such general right of privacy in the Bill of Rights, in any other part of the Constitution, or in any case ever before decided by this Court. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>At the oral argument in this case, we were told that the Connecticut law does not "conform to current community standards."  But it is not the function of this Court to decide cases on the basis of community standards.  We are here to decide cases "agreeably to the Constitution and laws of the United States."  It is the essence of judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 381 U. S. 531</a></p><p> duty to subordinate our own personal views, our own ideas of what legislation is wise and what is not.  If, as I should surely hope, the law before us does not reflect he standards of the people of Connecticut, the people of Connecticut can freely exercise their true Ninth and Tenth Amendment rights to persuade their elected representatives to repeal it.  That is the constitutional way to take this law off the books. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>]</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Amendments in question were, as everyone knows, originally adopted as limitations upon the power of the newly created Federal Government, not as limitations upon the powers of the individual States.  But the Court has held that many of the provisions of the first eight amendments are fully embraced by the Fourteenth Amendment as limitations upon state action, and some members of the Court have held the view that the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment made every provision of the first eight amendments fully applicable against the States.  <em>See Adamson v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/332/46/case.html">332 U.

To be sure, the injunction contained in the Connecticut statute coincides with the doctrine of certain religious faiths.  But if that were enough to invalidate a law under the provisions of the First Amendment relating to religion, then most criminal laws would be invalidated.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> the Ten Commandments.
