So far as the duties were exacted upon goods imported prior to the ratification of the Treaty of April 11, 1899, they were properly exacted.  So far as they were imposed upon importations after that date and prior to December 5, 1899, plaintiff is entitled to recover them back.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the Court of Claims is therefore reversed, and the case remanded to that court for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
