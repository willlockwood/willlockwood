In an agreement signed December 16, 2009, the Postal Service agreed not to pursue criminal charges, and Green agreed either to retire or to accept another position in a remote location for much less money.  Green chose to retire and submitted his resignation paperwork on February 9, 2010, effective March 31.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">On March 22\xe2\x80\x9441 days after resigning and 96 days after signing the agreement\xe2\x80\x94Green reported an unlawful constructive discharge to an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor, an administrative prerequisite to filing a complaint alleging discrimination or retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105(a)(1).  Green eventually filed suit in Federal District Court, which dismissed his complaint as untimely because he had not contacted the counselor within 45 days of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.  </i>The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the 45-day limitations period began to run on December 16, the date Green signed the agreement.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1. Because part of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d in a constructive-discharge claim is an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, the 45-day limitations period for such action begins running only after an employee resigns.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a) Where, as here, the regulatory text itself is not unambiguously clear, the Court relies on the standard rule for limitations periods, which provides that a limitations period ordinarily begins to run \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Wilson</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409\n.  Applied here, that rule offers three persuasive reasons to include the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation in the limitations period.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(i) First, resignation is part of the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d in a constructive-discharge claim, which comprises two basic elements: discriminatory conduct such that a reasonable employee would have felt compelled to resign and actual resignation, <i>Pennsylvania State Police</i> v. <i>Suders</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129\n.  Until he resigns, an employee does not have a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d for constructive discharge.  Under the standard rule, only after the employee has a complete and present cause of action does that trigger the limitations period.  In this respect, a constructive-discharge claim is no different from an ordinary wrongful-discharge claim, which accrues only after the employee is fired.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(ii) Second, although the standard rule may be subject to exception where clearly indicated by the text creating the limitations period, nothing in Title VII or the regulation suggests such displacement.  To the contrary, it is natural to read \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d as including the allegation forming the basis of the claim, which confirms the standard rule\xe2\x80\x99s applicability.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(iii) Third, practical considerations also confirm the merit of applying the standard rule.  Starting the clock ticking before a plaintiff can actually file suit does little to further the limitations period\xe2\x80\x99s goals and actively negates Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial structure.  A \xe2\x80\x9climitations perio[d] should not commence to run so soon that it becomes difficult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Delaware State College</i> v. <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, n.\xc2\xa016.  Nothing in the regulation suggests a two-step process in which an employee would have to file a complaint after an employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct, only to be forced to amend that complaint to allege constructive discharge after resigning.  Requiring that a complaint be filed before resignation occurs would also, <i>e.g.,</i> ignore that an employee may not be in a position to leave his job immediately.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b) Arguments against applying the standard rule here are rejected.  <i>Suders </i>stands not for the proposition that a constructive discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes only, but for the rule that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 149.  Nor was Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation the mere inevitable consequence of the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct.  <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, distinguished.  Finally, the important goal of promoting conciliation through early, informal contact with a counselor does not warrant treating a constructive discharge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2. A constructive-discharge claim accrues\xe2\x80\x94and the limitations period begins to run\xe2\x80\x94when the employee gives notice of his resignation, not on the effective date thereof.  The Tenth Circuit is left to determine, in the first instance, the date that Green in fact gave notice.

Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer for violating Title VII, he must, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cinitiate contact\xe2\x80\x9d with an Equal Employment Opportunity counselor at his agency \xe2\x80\x9cwithin 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105(a)(1) (2015).</p>\n<p>If an employee claims he has been fired for discriminatory reasons, the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d includes the discharge itself and the 45-day limitations period begins running only after the employee is fired.</p>\n<p>We address here when the limitations period begins to run for an employee who was not fired, but resigns in the face of intolerable discrimination\xe2\x80\x94a \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive\xe2\x80\x9d discharge.  We hold that, in such circumstances, the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d includes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, and that the 45-day clock for a constructive discharge begins running only after the employee resigns.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>We recite the following facts in the light most favorable to petitioner Marvin Green, against whom the District Court entered summary judgment.  Green is a black man who worked for the Postal Service for 35 years.  In 2008, he was serving as the postmaster for Englewood, Colorado when he applied for a promotion to the vacant postmaster position in nearby Boulder.  He was passed over.  Shortly thereafter, Green complained he was denied the promotion because of his race.</p>\n<p>Green\xe2\x80\x99s relations with his supervisors crumbled following his complaint.  Tensions peaked on December 11, 2009, when two of Green\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors accused him of intentionally delaying the mail\xe2\x80\x94a criminal offense.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71703.  They informed Green that the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) was investigating the charge and that OIG agents had arrived to interview him as part of their investigation.  After Green met with the OIG agents, his supervisors gave him a letter reassigning him to off-duty status until the matter was resolved.  Even though the OIG agents reported to Green\xe2\x80\x99s supervisors that no further investigation was warranted, the supervisors continued to represent to Green that \xe2\x80\x9cthe OIG is all over this\xe2\x80\x9d and that the \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal\xe2\x80\x9d charge \xe2\x80\x9ccould be a life changer.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 53.</p>\n<p>On December 16, 2009, Green and the Postal Service signed an agreement whose meaning remains disputed.  Relevant here, the Postal Service promised not to pursue criminal charges in exchange for Green\xe2\x80\x99s promise to leave his post in Englewood.  The agreement also apparently gave Green a choice: effective March 31, 2010, he could either retire or report for duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming\xe2\x80\x94population 451\xe2\x80\x94at a salary considerably lower than what he earned in his Denver suburb.  Green chose to retire and submitted his resignation to the Postal Service on February 9, 2010, effective March 31.</p>\n<p>On March 22\xe2\x80\x9441 days after submitting his resignation paperwork to the Postal Service on February 9, but 96 days after signing the settlement agreement on December 16\xe2\x80\x94Green contacted an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) counselor to report an unlawful constructive discharge.  He contended that his supervisors had threatened criminal charges and negotiated the resulting agreement in retaliation for his original complaint.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  He alleged that the choice he had been given effectively forced his resignation in violation of Title VII.</p>\n<p>Green eventually filed suit in the Federal District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging, <i>inter alia</i>, that the Postal Service constructively discharged him.  The Postal Service moved for summary judgment, arguing that Green had failed to make timely contact with an EEO counselor within 45 days of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d as required by 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105(a)(1).  The District Court granted the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.</p>\n<p>The Tenth Circuit affirmed, holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d encompassed only the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory actions and not Green\xe2\x80\x99s independent decision to resign on February 9.  <i>Green</i> v. <i>Donahue</i>, 760 F.\xc2\xa03d 1135 (2014).  Therefore, the 45-day limitations period started running when both parties signed the settlement agreement on December 16, 2009.  Accordingly, because 96 days passed between the agreement and when Green contacted an EEO counselor on March 22, 2010, his constructive-discharge claim was time barred.</p>\n<p>Two other Courts of Appeals agree with the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view that the limitations period begins to run for a constructive-discharge claim after the employer\xe2\x80\x99s last discriminatory act.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  As the Tenth Circuit recognized, however, other Courts of Appeals have held that the limitations period for a constructive-discharge claim does not begin to run until the employee resigns.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve this split.  575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  Because no party here supports the Tenth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation is not part of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d we appointed Catherine M. A. Carroll to defend that aspect of the judgment below.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  She has ably discharged her duties and the Court thanks her for her service.</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>Before a federal civil servant can sue his employer in court for discriminating against him in violation of Title VII, he must first exhaust his administrative remedies.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9316(c).  To exhaust those remedies, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has promulgated regulations that require, among other things, that a federal employee consult with an EEO counselor prior to filing a discrimination lawsuit.  Specifically, he \xe2\x80\x9cmust initiate contact with a Counselor within 45 days of the date of the matter alleged to be discriminatory or, in the case of personnel action, within 45 days of the effective date of the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105(a)(1).[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  The timeliness of Green\xe2\x80\x99s claim therefore turns on our interpretation of this EEOC regulation implementing Title VII.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]</p>\n<p>Although we begin our interpretation of the regulation with its text, the text in this case is not particularly helpful.  Nowhere does \xc2\xa71614.105 indicate whether a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d in a constructive-discharge claim includes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, as Green contends, or only the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct, as <i>amica </i>contends.  The word \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d simply means \xe2\x80\x9can allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014)\xe2\x80\x94a term that could readily apply to a discrimination-precipitated resignation.  So the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d could refer to all of the allegations underlying a claim of discrimination, including the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, or only to those allegations concerning the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct.  We therefore must turn to other canons of interpretation.</p>\n<p>The most helpful canon in this context is \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98standard rule\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for limitations periods.  <i>Graham County Soil &amp; Water Conservation Dist.</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Wilson</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 409,\n418 (2005)\n.  Ordinarily, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98limitations period commences when the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] cause of action does not become \xe2\x80\x98complete and present\xe2\x80\x99 for limitations purposes until the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund</i> v. <i>Ferbar Corp. of Cal.</i>,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n201 (1997)\n.  Although the standard rule can be displaced such that the limitations period begins to run before a plaintiff can file a suit, we \xe2\x80\x9cwill not infer such an odd result in the absence of any such indication\xe2\x80\x9d in the text of the limitations period.  <i>Reiter</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258,\n267 (1993)\n.</p>\n<p>Applying this default rule, we are persuaded that the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d in a constructive-discharge claim necessarily includes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation for three reasons.  First, in the context of a constructive-discharge claim, a resignation is part of the \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d necessary before a limitations period ordinarily begins to run.  Second, nothing in the regulation creating the limitations period here, \xc2\xa71614.105, clearly indicates an intent to displace this standard rule.  Third, practical considerations confirm the merit of applying the standard rule here.  We therefore interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d for a constructive-discharge claim to include the date Green resigned.</p>\n<p>A</p>\n<p>The standard rule for limitations periods requires us first to determine what is a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d for a constructive-discharge claim.  We hold that such a claim accrues only after an employee resigns.</p>\n<p>The constructive-discharge doctrine contemplates a situation in which an employer discriminates against an employee to the point such that his \xe2\x80\x9cworking conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position would have felt compelled to resign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pennsylvania State Police</i> v. <i>Suders</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129,\n141 (2004)\n.  When the employee resigns in the face of such circumstances, Title VII treats that resignation as tantamount to an actual discharge.  <i>Id.,</i> at 142\xe2\x80\x93143.</p>\n<p>A claim of constructive discharge therefore has two basic elements.  A plaintiff must prove first that he was discriminated against by his employer to the point where a reasonable person in his position would have felt compelled to resign.  <i>Id.,</i> at 148.  But he must also show that he actually resigned.  <i>Ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cA constructive discharge involves <i>both</i> an employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to leave and precipitating conduct .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  In other words, an employee cannot bring a constructive-discharge claim until he is constructively <i>discharged.  </i>Only after both elements are satisfied can he file suit to obtain relief.</p>\n<p>Under the standard rule for limitations periods, the limitations period should begin to run for a constructive-discharge claim only after a plaintiff resigns.  At that point\xe2\x80\x94and not before\xe2\x80\x94he can file a suit for constructive discharge.  So only at that point\xe2\x80\x94and not before\xe2\x80\x94does he have a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present\xe2\x80\x9d cause of action.  And only after he has a complete and present cause of action does a limitations period ordinarily begin to run.  Cf. <i>Mac\xe2\x80\x99s Shell Service, Inc.</i> v. <i>Shell Oil Products Co.</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 175\n\xe2\x80\x93190 (2010) (the limitations period for a constructive termination of a franchise agreement starts running when the agreement is constructively terminated).</p>\n<p>In this respect, a claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee is no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.  An ordinary wrongful discharge claim also has two basic elements: discrimination and discharge.  See <i>St. Mary\xe2\x80\x99s Honor Center</i> v. <i>Hicks</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 502,\n506 (1993)\n; 1 B. Lindemann, P. Grossman, &amp; C. Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law 21\xe2\x80\x9333 (5th ed. 2012) (Lindemann) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe sine qua non of a discharge case is, of course, a discharge\xe2\x80\x9d).  The claim accrues when the employee is fired.  At that point\xe2\x80\x94and not before\xe2\x80\x94he has a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplete and present cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  So at that point\xe2\x80\x94and not before\xe2\x80\x94the limitations period begins to run.</p>\n<p>With claims of either constructive discharge or actual discharge, the standard rule thus yields the same result: a limitations period should not begin to run until after the discharge itself.  In light of this rule, we interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71614.105 to refer to all of the elements that make up a constructive-discharge claim\xe2\x80\x94including an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.</p>\n<p>B</p>\n<p>Although the standard rule dictates that a limitations period should commence only after a claim accrues, there is an exception to that rule when the text creating the limitations period clearly indicates otherwise.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Dodd</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353,\n360 (2005)\n.  Nothing in the text of Title VII or the regulation, however, suggests that the standard rule should be displaced here.  To the contrary, the language of the regulation confirms our application of the default rule.</p>\n<p>As noted previously, the word \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d generally refers to \xe2\x80\x9can allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1126.  The natural reading of \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d thus refers to the allegation forming the basis of the discrimination claim\xe2\x80\x94here, a claim of constructive discharge.  And as discussed above, a constructive discharge claim requires two basic allegations: discriminatory conduct by the employer that leads to resignation of the employee.  So long as those acts are part of the same, single claim under consideration, they are part of the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x9d whatever the role of discrimination in each individual element of the claim.  Cf. <i>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101\n\xe2\x80\x93121 (2002) (holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is a single \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d that includes every act composing that claim, whether those acts are independently actionable or not).</p>\n<p>C</p>\n<p>Finally, we are also persuaded that applying the standard rule for limitations periods to constructive discharge makes a good deal of practical sense.  Starting the limitations clock ticking <i>before</i> a plaintiff can actually sue for constructive discharge serves little purpose in furthering the goals of a limitations period\xe2\x80\x94and it actively negates Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial structure.  Cf. <i>Zipes</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</i>,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385,\n398 (1982)\n (holding that the Title VII limitations period should be construed to \xe2\x80\x9chonor the remedial purpose of the legislation as a whole without negating the particular purpose of the filing requirement\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>This Court has recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthat the limitations perio[d] should not commence to run so soon that it becomes difficult for a layman to invoke the protection of the civil rights statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Delaware State College</i> v. <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, n.\xc2\xa016 (1980).  If the limitations period begins to run following the employer\xe2\x80\x99s precipitating discriminatory conduct, but before the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, the employee will be forced to file a discrimination complaint after the employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct and later amend the complaint to allege constructive discharge after he resigns.  Nothing in the regulation suggests it intended to require a layperson, while making this difficult decision, to follow such a two-step process in order to preserve any remedy if he is constructively discharged.</p>\n<p>Moreover, forcing an employee to lodge a complaint before he can bring a claim for constructive discharge places that employee in a difficult situation.  An employee who suffered discrimination severe enough that a reasonable person in his shoes would resign might nevertheless force himself to tolerate that discrimination for a period of time.  He might delay his resignation until he can afford to leave.  Or he might delay in light of other circumstances, as in the case of a teacher waiting until the end of the school year to resign.  Tr. 17.  And, if he feels he must stay for a period of time, he may be reluctant to complain about discrimination while still employed.  A complaint could risk termination\xe2\x80\x94an additional adverse consequence that he may have to disclose in future job applications.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p><i>Amica </i>and the dissent read \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d as having a clear enough meaning to displace our reliance on the standard rule for limitations periods.  They argue that \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d is not equivalent to \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccause of action,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d is a sufficiently clear statement that the standard claim accrual rule should not apply.  According to <i>amica </i>and the dissent, \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d refers only to the discriminatory acts of the Postal Service, not Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.</p>\n<p>We disagree.  There is nothing inherent in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d that clearly limits it to employer conduct.  Rather, as discussed above, the term can reasonably be interpreted to include the factual basis for a claim.  Green is not alleging just that the Postal Service discriminated against him.  He claims that the discrimination left him no choice but to resign.</p>\n<p><i>Amica </i>and the dissent dispute that a constructive discharge is a separate claim.  According to <i>amica </i>and the dissent, the constructive-discharge doctrine merely allows a plaintiff to expand any underlying discrimination claim to include the damages from leaving his job, thereby increasing his available remedies.  See 1 Lindemann 21\xe2\x80\x9349 (constructive discharge allows plaintiff to seek backpay, front pay, or reinstatement).  In support of this argument, <i>amica</i> and the dissent emphasize this Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement in <i>Suders </i>that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the constructive discharge doctrine, an employee\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable decision to resign because of unendurable working conditions is assimilated to a formal discharge <i>for remedial purposes</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.</i>, at 148 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in damages-enhancing respects\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>But the Court did not hold in <i>Suders </i>that a constructive discharge is tantamount to a formal discharge for remedial purposes exclusively.  To the contrary, it expressly held that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.  <i>Id.,</i> at 149 (holding that a hostile-work-environment claim is a \xe2\x80\x9clesser included component\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>graver</i> claim of hostile-environment constructive discharge\xe2\x80\x9d).  This holding was no mere dictum.  See <i>id.,</i> at 142 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII\xe2\x80\x9d).  We see no reason to excise an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation from his constructive-discharge claim for purposes of the limitations period.</p>\n<p>The concurrence sets out a theory that there are two<i> </i>kinds of constructive discharge for purposes of the limitations period: constructive discharge \xe2\x80\x9cclaims\xe2\x80\x9d where the employer \xe2\x80\x9cmakes conditions intolerable <i>with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d and constructive discharge \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d where the employer does not intend to force the employee to quit, but the discriminatory conditions of employment are so intolerable that the employee quits anyway.  <i>Post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x9311 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).  According to the concurrence, the limitations period does not begin to run until an employee resigns under the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d theory of constructive discharge, but begins at the last discriminatory act before resignation under the \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d theory.</p>\n<p>This sometimes-a-claim-sometimes-not theory of constructive discharge is novel and contrary to the constructive discharge doctrine.  The whole point of allowing an employee to claim \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive\xe2\x80\x9d discharge is that in circumstances of discrimination so intolerable that a reasonable person would resign, we treat the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation as though the employer actually fired him.  <i>Suders</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141\xe2\x80\x93143.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  We do not also require an employee to come forward with proof\xe2\x80\x94proof that would often be difficult to allege plausibly\xe2\x80\x94that not only was the dis-crimination so bad that he had to quit, but also that his quitting was his employer\xe2\x80\x99s plan all along.</p>\n<p><i>Amica</i> and the dissent also argue that their interpretation is more consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior precedent on when the limitations period begins to run for discrimination claims.  Under their interpretation, Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation was not part of the discriminatory \xe2\x80\x9cmatter,\xe2\x80\x9d but was instead the mere inevitable consequence of the Postal Service\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct, and therefore cannot be used to extend the limitations period.  See Brief for Court-Appointed <i>Amica Curiae</i> in Support of Judgment Below 21\xe2\x80\x9327 (Brief for <i>Amica Curiae</i>) (citing <i>Ledbetter</i> v. <i>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 618 (2007)\n, overruled by statute, Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009,\n\n123Stat.\n5; <i>Delaware State College</i> v. <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n; <i>United Air Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553 (1977)\n); <i>post, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x937 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (citing <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, and <i>Chardon</i> v. <i>Fernandez</i>,\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6 (1981)\n (<i>per curiam</i>)).  Similarly, the concurrence argues these cases require that an act done with discriminatory intent must occur within the limitations period.  <i>Post, </i>at 4 (opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p>But these cases are consistent with the standard rule that a limitations period begins to run after a claim accrues, not after an inevitable consequence of that claim.  In <i>Ricks</i>, for example, the Court considered the discrimination claim of a college faculty member who was denied tenure and given a 1-year \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98terminal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d contract for his last year teaching.  449 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258.  The plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim accrued\xe2\x80\x94and he could have sued\xe2\x80\x94when the college informed him he would be denied tenure and gave him \xe2\x80\x9cexplicit notice that his employment would end\xe2\x80\x9d when his 1-year contract expired.  <i>Ibid</i>.  The Court held that the limitations period began to run on that date, and not after his 1-year contract expired.  That final year of teaching was merely an inevitable consequence of the tenure denial the plaintiff claimed was discriminatory.</p>\n<p>Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, by contrast, is not merely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim.  That is, Green could not sue for constructive discharge until he actually resigned.  Of course, Green could not resign and then wait until the consequences of that resignation became most painful to complain.  For example, he could not use the date of the expiration of his health insurance after his resignation to extend the limitations period.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cinevitable consequence\xe2\x80\x9d principle of <i>Ricks</i>, <i>Ledbetter</i>, and <i>Evans </i>does not change the focus of the limitations period, which remains on the claim of discrimination itself.  See <i>Lewis</i> v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n560 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205,\n214 (2010)\n (holding <i>Evans</i> and its progeny \xe2\x80\x9cestablish only that a Title VII plaintiff must show a present violation within the limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115\xe2\x80\x93121 (holding limitations period for hostile-work-environment claim runs from the last act composing the claim).[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  For a constructive discharge, the claim does not exist until the employee resigns.</p>\n<p>Finally, <i>amica </i>contends that her interpretation of the regulation better advances the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s goal of promoting conciliation for federal employees through early, informal contact with an EEO counselor.  See Exec. Order No. 11478, \xc2\xa74, 34 Fed. Reg. 12986 (1969) (counseling for federal employees \xe2\x80\x9cshall encourage the resolution of employee problems on an informal basis\xe2\x80\x9d).  The dissent suggests that our holding will make a discrimination victim the master of his complaint, permitting him to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98exten[d] the limitation[s period] indefinitely\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by waiting to resign.  <i>Post, </i>at 7 (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The concurrence claims that an employee who relies on the limitations period in waiting to resign is \xe2\x80\x9cdoubly out of luck\xe2\x80\x9d if his otherwise-meritorious discrimination claim is time barred and he cannot show the discrimination was so intolerable that it amounted to a constructive discharge.  <i>Post, </i>at 13 (opinion of Alito, J.).</p>\n<p>These concerns are overblown.  <i>Amica</i> may be right that it is more difficult to achieve conciliation after an employee resigns.  But the same is true for a federal civil servant who is fired by his agency for what the employee believes to be a discriminatory purpose.  And neither decision is necessarily permanent\xe2\x80\x94a resignation or a termination may be undone after an employee contacts a counselor.  Conciliation, while important, does not warrant treating a constructive discharge different from an actual discharge for purposes of the limitations period.</p>\n<p>As for the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s fear, we doubt that a victim of employment discrimination will continue to work in an intolerable environment merely because he can thereby extend the limitations period for a claim of constructive discharge.  If anything, a plaintiff who wishes to prevail on the merits<i> </i>of his constructive discharge claim has the opposite incentive.  A claim of constructive discharge requires proof of a causal link between the allegedly intolerable conditions and the resignation.  See 1 Lindemann 21\xe2\x80\x9345, and n.\xc2\xa0106.</p>\n<p>And as for the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s double-loser concern, no plaintiff would be well advised to delay pursuing what he believes to be a meritorious non-constructive-discharge-discrimination claim on the ground that a timely filed constructive discharge claim could resuscitate other time-lapsed claims.  The 45-day limitations period begins running on any separate underlying claim of discrimination when that claim accrues, regardless of whether the plaintiff eventually claims constructive discharge.  The limitations-period analysis is always conducted claim by claim.</p>\n<p>IV</p>\n<p>Our decision that a resignation triggers the limitations period for a constructive-discharge claim raises the question of when<i> </i>precisely<i> </i>an employee resigns.  Here, Green and the Government agree that an employee resigns when he gives his employer definite notice of his intent to resign.  If an employee gives \xe2\x80\x9ctwo weeks\xe2\x80\x99 notice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94telling his employer he intends to leave after two more weeks of employment\xe2\x80\x94the limitations period begins to run on the day he tells his employer, not his last day at work.  (This issue was not addressed by the Tenth Circuit and, accordingly, <i>amica</i> takes no position on it.<i> </i>See Brief for <i>Amica Curiae</i> 42.)</p>\n<p>We agree.  A notice rule flows directly from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  In <i>Ricks</i>, 449 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 250, and <i>Chardon</i> v. <i>Fernandez</i>,\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6\n, the Court explained that an ordinary wrongful-discharge claim accrues\xe2\x80\x94and the limitations period begins to run\xe2\x80\x94when the employer notifies the employee he is fired, not on the last day of his employment.  <i>Ricks</i>, 449 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258\xe2\x80\x93259; <i>Chardon</i>, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 8.  Likewise, here, we hold that a constructive-discharge claim accrues\xe2\x80\x94and the limitations period begins to run\xe2\x80\x94when the employee gives notice of his resignation, not on the effective date of that resignation.</p>\n<p>One factual issue remains: when exactly Green gave the Postal Service notice of his resignation.  The Government argues that Green resigned on December 16, 2009\xe2\x80\x94when he signed the settlement agreement\xe2\x80\x94and that his claim is therefore still time barred.  Green argues that he did not resign until February 9, 2010\xe2\x80\x94when he submitted his retirement paperwork\xe2\x80\x94and that his claim is therefore timely.  We need not resolve this issue.  Having concluded that the limitations period for Green\xe2\x80\x99s constructive-discharge claim runs from the date he gave notice of his resignation, we leave it to the Tenth Circuit to determine when this in fact occurred.</p>\n<p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p>For these reasons, we vacate the judgment of the Tenth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We assume without deciding that it is unlawful for a federal agency to retaliate against a civil servant for complaining of discrimination.

(quoting <i>Suders</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141, 148).  This ignores the more obvious explanation for this qualification: The Court was distinguishing between the merits of a claim of constructive discharge generally, where resignation is imputed as a discriminatory act of the employer, and the affirmative defense avail-able to an employer in a hostile work environment claim specifically, which allows an employer to defend against a hostile work environment claim in certain circumstances if it took no \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98official act\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d against the employee.  <i>Id.,</i> at 143\xe2\x80\x93146.  The Court in <i>Suders </i>recognized that it would be bizarre to always impute resignation as an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d of the employer in a constructive discharge hostile work environment case and prohibit the employer from relying on the no-\xe2\x80\x9cofficial-act\xe2\x80\x9d defense, because it would make it easier to prove the \xe2\x80\x9cgraver\xe2\x80\x9d claim of a constructive discharge hostile work environment than to prove a hostile work environment claim.  <i>Id.,</i> at 148\xe2\x80\x93149.  Thus, the Court declined to hold that resignation in a constructive discharge case was categorically an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d in all instances.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In other words, the Court sought a measure of parity between constructive discharge and ordinary discrimination\xe2\x80\x94parity that we extend to the limitations period here.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The dissent relies on <i>Morgan</i>\xe2\x80\x99s other holding that, unlike a hostile-work-environment claim that may comprise many discriminatory acts, discrete claims of discrimination based on independent discriminatory acts cannot be aggregated to extend the limitations period.  See <i>post, </i>at 3 (opinion of Thomas, J.) (citing 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109\xe2\x80\x93113).

We have repeatedly held that the time to pursue an employment discrimination claim starts running when a discriminatory act occurs, and that a fresh limitations period does not start upon the occurrence of a later nondiscriminatory act\xe2\x80\x94even if that later act carries forward the effects of the earlier discrimination.  See, <i>e.g., United Air Lines, Inc.</i> v. <i>Evans</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553,\n558 (1977)\n; <i>Delaware State College</i> v. <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n\xe2\x80\x93258 (1980); <i>Chardon</i> v. <i>Fernandez</i>,\n\n454 U.\xc2\xa0S. 6,\n8 (1981)\n (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Lorance</i> v. <i>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900\n\xe2\x80\x93908, 911 (1989); <i>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</i> v. <i>Morgan</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101,\n113 (2002)\n; <i>Ledbetter</i> v. <i>Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co.</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 618,\n628 (2007)\n.  Without mentioning this consistent line of precedent, the Court categorically declares that the limitations period for constructive discharge cases starts upon the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation, no matter when the last discriminatory act occurred.  This effectively disposes of the discriminatory-intent requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Rather than jettison our precedent, I would hold that the limitations period for constructive discharge claims\xe2\x80\x94like all other employment discrimination claims\xe2\x80\x94starts running upon a discriminatory act of the employer.  But I would also hold that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation can, in many cases, be considered a discriminatory act of the employer.  This is so where an employer subjects an employee to intolerable working conditions <i>with the discriminatory intent to force the employee to resign</i>.  In these circumstances, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s consequent resignation is tantamount to an intentional termination by the em-ployer, and so gives rise to a fresh limitations period just as a conventional termination would.  Absent such intent, however, the resignation is not an independent discriminatory act but merely a delayed consequence of earlier discrimination.  The resignation may be a basis for enhancing damages in a claim brought on the underlying discrimination, but it cannot restart the limitations clock.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, Green presented sufficient evidence that the Postal Service intended to force him to resign when it presented him with a settlement agreement requiring that he either retire or transfer to a distant post office for much less pay.

The Court observes that this language \xe2\x80\x9cis not particularly helpful\xe2\x80\x9d in resolving the question presented, and so it quickly moves on to other considerations.  <i>Ante,</i> at 5.  I think that more can be discerned from the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The Court observes that a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter\xe2\x80\x9d in this context is \xe2\x80\x9can allegation forming the basis of a claim or defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1126 (10th ed. 2014); <i>ante,</i> at 5.  But the Court fails to plug in the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s critical qualifier: The matter must be (alleged to be) <i>discrimina-tory</i>.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d is thus most fairly read to refer to the allegation <i>of discrimination</i> that underlies an employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim, not just any fact that supports the claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s text were unclear on this point, the next place I would look is not to a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard rule\xe2\x80\x9d governing limitations periods, as the majority does, <i>ibid.</i>, but to the specific limitations rules we apply in other Title VII cases.  Private-sector Title VII plaintiffs are required to file a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) within 180 or 300 days \xe2\x80\x9cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(1); see <i>Morgan</i>, <i>supra</i> (construing this statutory provision).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Although this language is not identical to the regulation at issue here, nothing in either text requires that they be read as setting different rules.  Indeed, the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s Compliance Manual treats them the same\xe2\x80\x94it describes the regulation as requiring federal employees to contact a counselor within 45 days of \xe2\x80\x9cthe alleged discriminatory employment <i>practice</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d and it cites <i>Morgan </i>as providing the governing standard.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  We also granted review in this case on the premise that the same rule would apply to both federal-sector and private-sector Title VII cases: Green\xe2\x80\x99s petition and merits brief ask us to decide when the filing period for constructive discharge claims begins as a matter of \xe2\x80\x9cfederal employment discrimination law\xe2\x80\x9d generally, Pet. for Cert. i; Brief for Peti-tioner i, and the Circuit split he alleges consists primarily of cases in which the limitations period ran from the date of an unlawful employment \xe2\x80\x9cpractice,\xe2\x80\x9d see Pet. for Cert. 11\xe2\x80\x9316.  The majority, for its part, seems to agree that the same rules should apply in the federal and private sectors, and it too relies on private-sector cases in describing the Circuit split that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is meant to \xe2\x80\x9cresolve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x935, and nn.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s relegation of our Title VII timeliness cases to its rebuttal argument, see <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9314, is thus surprising.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our Title VII precedents set somewhat different limitations rules for claims based on a discrete act of discrimination (such as termination, failure to hire, or demotion) and claims based on a hostile work environment.  I will focus on the former set of rules because Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation was a discrete act that was precipitated by another discrete act\xe2\x80\x94namely, the settlement agreement that required him to retire or transfer to a far-off, lower paying position.  For private-sector claims based on discrete acts, the limitations period starts to run on the day the discriminatory act occurred and expires 180 or 300 days later.  <i>Morgan</i>, 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 110.  This means that an act done <i>with discriminatory intent</i>\xe2\x80\x94not merely some act bearing on the claim\xe2\x80\x94must have occurred within the limitations period.  We therefore held in <i>Morgan </i>that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete discriminatory acts are not actionable if time barred, even when they are related to acts alleged in timely filed charges,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ca time-barred act [cannot] justify filing a charge concerning a termination that was <i>not independently discriminatory</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 113 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We spoke even more directly to the point in <i>Ledbetter</i>.  There we described \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory intent\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cdefining element\xe2\x80\x9d of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 624, and held that the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim of pay discrimination was untimely because she did not allege that any \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the [limitations] period,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 628.  Although the plaintiff had suffered lower pay within the limitations period because of earlier alleged discrimination, we explained that under our precedents a new limitations pe-riod \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not commenc[e] upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(discussing <i>Evans</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 553\n, <i>Ricks</i>,\n\n449 U.\xc2\xa0S. 250\n, <i>Lorance</i>,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900\n, and <i>Morgan</i>, <i>supra</i>).<i> </i>Relying on nondiscriminatory acts to establish a timely claim, we reasoned, would impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9cshift intent from one act (the act that consummates the discriminatory employment practice) to a later act that was not performed with bias or discriminatory motive.  The effect of this shift would be to impose liability in the absence of the requisite intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 629.  At the same time, we recognized that when multiple acts that are each \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d occur, \xe2\x80\x9ca fresh violation takes place\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and thus a new limitations period starts running\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwhen each act is committed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 628.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">These principles lead to the following rule for constructive discharge cases: An employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation triggers a fresh limitations period if the resignation itself constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d act of the employer.  In my view, an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation in the face of intoler-able working conditions can be considered a discriminatory act of the employer when the employer makes conditions intolerable <i>with the specific discriminatory intent of forcing the employee to resign</i>.  If the employer lacks that intent, however, the limitations period runs from the discriminatory act that precipitated the resignation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This approach reflects the fact that there are two kinds of constructive discharge.  Much of the disagreement between the majority and dissent stems from their differing views of the nature of constructive discharge.  To the majority, constructive discharge is always a standalone \xe2\x80\x9cclaim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  To Justice Thomas and the friend of the Court we appointed to defend the judgment below, constructive discharge is never a separate claim, but merely \xe2\x80\x9ca counterdefense to an employer\xe2\x80\x99s contention that a resignation was voluntary\xe2\x80\x9d that allows the resigning employee to recover backpay and other relief unavailable to employees who quit voluntarily.  <i>Post, </i>at 9.  As I see it, each side is partly right.  The label \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge\xe2\x80\x9d is best understood to refer to two different (though related) concepts, one a distinct claim and one not.  This case requires us to distinguish between the two and to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify with care the specific employment practice that is at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ledbetter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 624 (citing <i>Morgan</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 110\xe2\x80\x93111).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The first kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer subjects an employee to intolerable conditions with the specific discriminatory <i>intent </i>of forcing the employee to quit.  In this situation, the employer has deliberately terminated the employee\xe2\x80\x94a discrete employment action.  The discharge is termed \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive,\xe2\x80\x9d however, because it is formally effected by the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation rather than the employer\xe2\x80\x99s pink slip.  The termination can nevertheless be considered a discriminatory act of the employer because the employer intends to terminate the employee and\xe2\x80\x94through the imposition of intolerable conditions\xe2\x80\x94forces the employee to \xe2\x80\x9crubberstamp\xe2\x80\x9d that decision by resigning.  Cf. <i>Staub</i> v. <i>Proctor Hospital</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 411,\n425 (2011)\n (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); <i>id.,</i> at 419 (majority opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cAnimus and responsibility for [an] adverse action can both be attributed to [an] ear-lier agent .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. if the adverse action is the intended consequence of that agent\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the resignation is the \xe2\x80\x9cact that consummates the discriminatory employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d of terminating the employee, <i>Ledbetter</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 629, it triggers a fresh limitations period.  In such cases, the constructive discharge should, like a formal discharge, be treated as a distinct cause of action\xe2\x80\x94what we might call a proper \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge claim.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory intent sometimes will manifest itself only outside the limitations period.  Consider, for example, an employer that demotes an employee (say, from executive to office assistant) for discriminatory reasons and with the intent that the loss of prestige will force the employee to quit.  By the time the employee finally cracks and resigns, the discriminatory <i>demotion</i> may be outside the limitations window and not independently actionable.  But the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory intent to <i>terminate</i> the employee can carry forward to the eventual resignation.  We recognized this possibility in <i>Ledbetter</i>.  We explained that a plaintiff generally cannot create a timely Title VII claim by \xe2\x80\x9cattach[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the discriminatory intent accompanying an act outside the limitations period to another act that occurred within the limitations period.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 625, 629.  At the same time, we acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be instances where the elements forming a cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94discriminatory intent and an employment action\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cspan more than 180 days\xe2\x80\x9d (that is<i>,</i> the applicable limitations period).  <i>Id.,</i> at 631, n.\xc2\xa03.  In such a case, we said, the limitations period would start to run when \xe2\x80\x9cthe employment practice was executed,\xe2\x80\x9d because that is when \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he act and intent had .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. been joined.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Under my example, then, the employer \xe2\x80\x9cforms an illegal discriminatory intent\xe2\x80\x9d to terminate the employee at the time of the demotion, but the termination is not \xe2\x80\x9cexecuted\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconsummated\xe2\x80\x9d until the employee resigns some time later.  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>id.,</i> at 629.  Only at that point have the discriminatory intent to terminate and the act of termination been \xe2\x80\x9cjoined,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore only at that point does the limitations period for the wrongful discharge start to run.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The second kind of constructive discharge occurs when an employer imposes intolerable conditions for discriminatory reasons but does <i>not</i> intend to force an employee to resign.  This is quite different from an ordinary discharge because the critical element of intent is missing.  The resignation cannot be considered an intentionally discriminatory act of the employer because it is not something the employer deliberately brought about; it is simply a later-arising consequence of the earlier discrimination.  The resignation thus does not trigger a fresh limitations period or give rise to a separate cause of action.  See <i>Evans</i>, 431 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 558 (A nondiscriminatory act that \xe2\x80\x9cgives present effect to a past act of discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is not actionable); <i>Ricks</i>, 449 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he proper focus is upon the time of the <i>discriminatory acts</i>, not upon the time at which the <i>consequences</i> of the acts became most painful\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)); <i>Ledbetter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 628 (\xe2\x80\x9cA new violation does not occur, and a new [limitations] period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This does not let the employer off the hook.  It is still liable for the acts of discrimination that precipitated the resignation, provided that the employee properly and timely challenges them.  And in a suit brought on those underlying acts, the resignation\xe2\x80\x94if reasonable\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cis assimilated to a formal discharge <i>for remedial purposes</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pennsylvania State Police</i> v. <i>Suders</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129,\n141 (2004)\n (emphasis added).  The resigning employee can recover, as damages for the underlying discrimination, \xe2\x80\x9call damages [that would be] available for formal discharge\xe2\x80\x9d but which are normally unavailable to employees who voluntarily quit.  <i>Id.,</i> at 147, n.\xc2\xa08; see <i>post</i>,<i> </i>at<i> </i>8\xe2\x80\x939 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  A resignation that is the reasonable but unintended result of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory acts thus does not lead to a standalone \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, it is a basis for increasing damageson the underlying discrimination claim\xe2\x80\x94what we might call a \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge damages enhancement.\xe2\x80\x9dSee <i>Suders</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 148 (analogizing constructive discharge to \xe2\x80\x9can actual termination in damages-enhancing respects\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority asserts that in <i>Suders </i>the Court \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly held\xe2\x80\x9d that constructive discharge is always its own distinct claim.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  I do not think that the <i>Suders </i>Court would have taken such pains to qualify its statements that a constructive discharge is akin to an actual termination \xe2\x80\x9cfor remedial purposes\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin damages-enhancing respects,\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 141, 148, had that been its intention.  Nor was it necessary for the Court to resolve whether constructive discharge is a separate cause of action or merely a basis for enhancing damages.  The majority observes that <i>Suders </i>referred to a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d for constructive discharge.  See <i>ante,</i> at 11.  But the use of that term does not indicate that constructive discharge is (always) an independent cause of action any more than stray references to a \xe2\x80\x9cclaim for punitive damages,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>e.g., BMW of North America, Inc. </i>v.<i> Gore</i>,\n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 559,\n564 (1996)\n; <i>Mastrobuono</i> v. <i>Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.</i>,\n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52,\n58 (1995)\n, mean that punitive damages are actionable independent of an underlying tort claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority also asserts that intent to cause a resignation is unnecessary for a constructive discharge cause of action because the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole point\xe2\x80\x9d of constructive discharge is to treat the resignation like a firing.  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  I had thought that the \xe2\x80\x9cwhole point\xe2\x80\x9d of a Title VII disparate-treatment claim was to combat <i>intentional </i>discrimination.  See,<i> e.g.</i>, <i>Watson</i> v. <i>Fort Worth Bank &amp; Trust</i>,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 977,\n1002 (1988)\n (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] disparate-treatment challenge focuses exclusively on the intent of the employer\xe2\x80\x9d).  A resignation cannot be deemed the equivalent of an actionable intentional termination if the employer lacks intent to terminate.  See <i>Staub</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 417\xe2\x80\x93418 (holding that a person who \xe2\x80\x9cdid not intend to cause [a] dismissal\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be deemed \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible\xe2\x80\x9d for the dismissal, even if the dismissal was the \xe2\x80\x9cresult\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeable consequence\xe2\x80\x9d of the person\xe2\x80\x99s actions); see also <i>id.,</i> at 417 (\xe2\x80\x9cIntentional torts such as this .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. generally require that the actor intend the <i>consequences </i>of an act, not simply the act itself\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  But as I have explained, a resignation in those circumstances may still be treated like a firing for damages purposes.  Our cases demand nothing more.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The framework I propose respects the fundamental rule that an act done with discriminatory intent must have occurred within the limitations period.  It also comports with the default rule that limitations periods start to run when a cause of action accrues.  When an employer intends to force an employee to resign, the resignation gives rise to a new cause of action for constructive discharge, with a limitations period that runs from the date of the resignation.  But when an employer does not intend to force the employee to resign, the employee\xe2\x80\x99s only cause of action is based on the underlying discriminatory acts, and the limitations period runs from the time <i>that </i>claim accrued.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  It is thus entirely unnecessary for the majority to abandon the discriminatory-intent requirement in service of the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d limitations rule.  These two rules fit together perfectly once one appreciates the dual nature of constructive discharge.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is abundantly clear that the majority has abandoned the discriminatory-intent requirement and would deem a constructive discharge claim timely even if no discriminatory act occurred within the limitations period.  The majority admits as much.  It declares that the employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory conduct and the employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation are both \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the \xe2\x80\x98matter alleged to be discriminatory,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore (in its view) the resignation may trigger the limitations period \xe2\x80\x9c<i>whatever</i> the role of discrimination in [the resignation] element.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 8 (emphasis added).  To support this dubious proposition, the majority cites <i>Morgan</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that an individual act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable for the act to start a fresh limitations period.  <i>Ante</i>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  This analogy is particularly inapt because Green\xe2\x80\x99s constructive discharge claim is based on a discrete act, not a hostile work environment.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4.  Even setting that aside, <i>Morgan </i>held only that an act contributing to a hostile work environment need not be independently actionable by dint of its <i>severity</i>.  That is because a hostile work environment claim is based on the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>cumulative</i> effect of individual acts\xe2\x80\x9d that may not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sufficiently affect the conditions of employment to implicate Title VII\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d unless considered in the aggregate.  536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115 (emphasis added).  Nothing in <i>Morgan </i>suggests that the limitations period for a hostile work environment claim can run from<i> an act that is not discriminatory</i>.  To the contrary, the Court referred to individual \xe2\x80\x9cact[s] of <i>harassment</i>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94such as \xe2\x80\x9cracial jokes, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. racially derogatory acts, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. negative comments regarding the capacity of blacks to be supervisors, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. various racial epithets\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as triggering the limitations period.  <i>Id.,</i> at 115, 120 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority opines that its rule is better for employees because it prevents the limitations period from expiring before an employee resigns.  <i>Ante,</i> at 9.  Things are not that simple.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule benefits only those employees who can meet the demanding standard for constructive discharge, while setting a springe for those who cannot.  Constructive discharge is an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated\xe2\x80\x9d form of discrimination involving truly \xe2\x80\x9cintolerable\xe2\x80\x9d working conditions that leave an employee no choice but to resign.  <i>Suders</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 146\xe2\x80\x93147.  This is an objective standard, <i>id.,</i> at 141, and what is subjectively intolerable to a particular employee may strike a court or jury as merely unpleasant.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So imagine an employee who is subjected to sexual harassment at her federal workplace but\xe2\x80\x94relying on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule\xe2\x80\x94does not pursue EEO counseling until 45 days after the harassment leads her to resign.  Suppose too that the last act of harassment occurred the day before she resigned.  If a court ultimately concludes that the harassment was objectively intolerable and the employee was justified in resigning, she can recover for the constructive discharge.  But if it turns out that she has proved only \xe2\x80\x9cordinary discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d without the \xe2\x80\x9csomething more\xe2\x80\x9d needed to establish constructive discharge, <i>id.,</i> at 147 (internal quotation marks omitted), the employee is doubly out of luck: Not only does her constructive discharge fail on the merits, but any \xe2\x80\x9clesser included\xe2\x80\x9d hostile work environment claim that she might have brought (and prevailed on), <i>id.,</i> at 149, is time barred.  Encouraging employees to wait until after resigning to pursue discrimination claims thus may needlessly deprive unwary discrimination victims of relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The better approach is to encourage employees to seek EEO counseling (or, in the private sector, file an EEOC charge) at the earliest opportunity, based on the underlying discriminatory acts.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  Every allegation of constructive discharge must be based on an actionable discriminatory practice, see <i>ibid.</i>; 1 B. Lindemann, P. Grossman, &amp; C. Weirich, Employment Discrimination Law\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9349 (5th ed. 2012), for which the employee can immediately seek counseling and pursue a discrimination claim.  If the employee later resigns, he or she can seek damages from the resignation as part of that timely claim.  See <i>supra</i>, at 9, and n.\xc2\xa04.  Under the framework I have set forth, an employee who fails to pursue the underlying discrimination claim can still pursue a standalone constructive discharge claim so long as there is sufficient evidence that the employer acted with intent to force the employee to resign.  This will often be the case when working conditions are so intoler-able that a reasonable employee would be compelled to quit.  The employer will usually be aware that conditions are terrible, and \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roof that a defendant acted knowingly very often gives rise to a reasonable inference that the defendant also acted purposely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Loughrin</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]  But the possibility of recovering damages for only the constructive discharge, and not for discrimination suffered before the resignation, will be an unsatisfactory alternative for many employees who have suffered through unendurable working conditions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It remains to apply the foregoing principles to this case.  The Tenth Circuit held that the Postal Service was entitled to summary judgment on its limitations defense.  The question therefore is whether Green adduced sufficient evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service <i>intended</i> to force his resignation whenit presented him with the settlement agreement.  If so, then the limitations period ran from the date of Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I have little trouble concluding that Green has carried his burden.  Indeed, the Postal Service virtually concedes the point.  It observes that the agreement expressly stated that Green <i>would</i> retire, and provided for his reporting to duty in Wamsutter, Wyoming, only in the event that the retirement fell through.  App. 60\xe2\x80\x9361; Brief for Respondent 33.  A jury could reasonably conclude that the Postal Service, by offering Green a choice between retiring and taking a lower paying job hundreds of miles away, in-tended to make him choose retirement.  Accordingly, for sum-mary judgment purposes, the 45-day window for contacting an EEO counselor ran from the date on which Green resigned\xe2\x80\x94or, more precisely, the date on which he gave the Postal Service notice of his retirement, see <i>ante,</i> at 16.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I am inclined to agree with Green that\xe2\x80\x94viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to him\xe2\x80\x94he did not give notice of his retirement until he submitted his retirement papers, making his claim timely.  Although the settlement agreement provided that he would retire, it alternatively allowed him to transfer to Wyoming.  Unless Green would have been turned away from the Wamsutter Post Office despite that language had he chosen to go there, it was not until Green submitted his retirement papers that one could say with certainty that his position would be terminated rather than transferred.  That said, like the majority I am content to leave this question for the Tenth Circuit to tackle on remand.  I accordingly concur in the judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0This 180- or 300-day period is often referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9ccharging\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfiling\xe2\x80\x9d period.

The term \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d means characterized by differential treatment that lacks a sound justification.

In that case, the Court considered a statute that provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he right to compensation for disability .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be barred unless a claim therefor is filed within one year after the injury.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 197 (quoting\n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7913(a) (1952)).  The Court held that the 1-year period began at the time of injury, not when the employee later became disabled as a result of the injury and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress meant what it said when it limited recovery to one year from date of injury, and \xe2\x80\x98injury\xe2\x80\x99 does not mean \xe2\x80\x98disability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  342 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 199\xe2\x80\x93200.  Although that reading meant that \xe2\x80\x9can employee [could] be barred from filing his claim before his right to file it arises,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court refused to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite the statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid that result.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see also, <i>e.g., Dodd </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353\n\xe2\x80\x93360 (2005) (giving effect to the clear text of a limitations provision even though that reading \xe2\x80\x9cma[de] it difficult\xe2\x80\x9d for certain movants \xe2\x80\x9cto obtain relief\xe2\x80\x9d and could lead to \xe2\x80\x9charsh results\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Like the limitations provision in <i>Pillsbury</i>, 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105 makes clear that the limitations period could begin before any constructive-discharge claim accrues, lest \xe2\x80\x9cwhat was intended to be a limitation [be] no limitation at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  342 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 200.  The regulation instructs that the limitations period begins to run when the \xe2\x80\x9cmatter alleged to be discriminatory\xe2\x80\x9d occurs\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> the discriminatory conduct of the employer.  To say that this includes Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation could \xe2\x80\x9chave the effect of extending the limitation indefinitely.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.; see Part I\xe2\x80\x93A,<i> supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the majority downplays <i>Morgan</i> and <i>Ricks</i> by claiming that Green\xe2\x80\x99s resignation was \xe2\x80\x9cnot merely an inevitable consequence of the discrimination he suffered; it is an essential part of his constructive-discharge claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 13.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] claim that an employer constructively discharged an employee,\xe2\x80\x9d the majority contends, \xe2\x80\x9cis no different from a claim that an employer actually discharged an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  This reasoning cannot be reconciled with the regulatory text and fails to grapple with our precedents<i>.  </i>By isolating Green\xe2\x80\x99s late response to the settlement agreement rather than his employer\xe2\x80\x99s alleged coercion of Green to sign that agreement, the majority ignores the discriminatory act and bestows on Green an advantage that other employees subject to wrongful discrimination do not have.  Had Green signed termination papers rather than settlement papers, there would be no question about the untimeliness of his claims.  As in <i>Ricks</i>, the time for Green\xe2\x80\x99s claim would have begun to run when his employer discriminated against him, even if the termination was not effective until months later.  449 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 257; see also <i>Chardon</i>, 454 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 8 (same).  But today, the majority decides that Green\xe2\x80\x99s claim is different.  In doing so, the majority elevates constructive discharge to the status of a super termination capable of extending a limitations period far beyond the time the employer acted discriminatorily.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s error is not merely one of regulatory misinterpretation.  By misreading the regulation, the majority expands the constructive-discharge doctrine beyond its original bounds.  In particular, the majority cements the (mistaken) notion that constructive discharge is an independent cause of action\xe2\x80\x94and not a mere counterdefense\xe2\x80\x94by unjustifiably focusing on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s response to an employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  See,<i> e.g., ante</i>, at<i> </i>6\xe2\x80\x9314.  In doing so, the majority exacerbates the problems that <i>Pennsylvania State Police </i>v.<i> Suders</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129 (2004)\n, first created in adopting a capacious definition of \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In holding that a discrimination claim based on constructive discharge accrues when an employee resigns, the majority wrongly assumes that constructive discharge is a separate claim equivalent to an actual discharge under Title VII.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But the constructive-discharge doctrine is best understood as \xe2\x80\x9ca counter-defense to the employer[\xe2\x80\x99]s defense that the worker [voluntarily] quit,\xe2\x80\x9d and not a separate claim.  <i>EEOC </i>v.<i> R.\xc2\xa0J.

Empl. &amp; Lab. L. 401, 406\xe2\x80\x93407 (2002).  An employee who voluntarily quit usually lost the right to backpay and other remedies, whereas an employee who was fired for discriminatory reasons did not.  See <i>id</i>.<i>,</i> at 403.  The constructive-discharge doctrine enabled courts to provide a remedy to those employees who voluntarily quit based on the fiction that their decision to quit was not actually voluntary.  See <i>ibid.</i>; <i>Suders</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 147, n.\xc2\xa08.  Thus, as it was originally conceived, constructive discharge was not an independ-ent cause of action but instead a counterdefense to an employer\xe2\x80\x99s contention that a resignation was voluntary, and thus, should \xe2\x80\x9cfactor into the damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Knabe </i>v.<i> Boury Corp.</i>, 114 F.\xc2\xa03d 407, 408, n.\xc2\xa01 (CA3 1997); see also <i>Russ </i>v.<i> Van Scoyoc Assoc., Inc.</i>, 122 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 29, 35\xe2\x80\x9336 (DC 2000) (collecting cases).  So understood, an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation does not complete any cause of action, and thus does not trigger the limitations period.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority contends that <i>Suders</i> marked a departure from this original conception of constructive discharge by \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly h[o]ld[ing] that constructive discharge is a claim distinct from the underlying discriminatory act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11.  But, that case does not resolve the issue one way or the other.  To be sure, <i>Suders</i> contains a few statements suggesting that constructive discharge is a claim.  As the majority points out, for example, <i>Suders</i> states that a hostile work environment claim is less \xe2\x80\x9cgrav[e]\xe2\x80\x9d than a \xe2\x80\x9c<i>claim</i> of hostile-environment constructive discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca claim for constructive discharge lies under Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 11 (citing <i>Suders</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 142, 149; emphasis added); see also <i>id.</i>, at 133 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9csexual harassment/constructive discharge claim\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 143 (referring to \xe2\x80\x9cconstructive discharge claims\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the same time, however, the question at issue in <i>Suders </i>was the availability of affirmative defenses.  In that vein, <i>Suders</i> held only that employers could avail themselves of those defenses if an \xe2\x80\x9cofficial act\xe2\x80\x9d of the company \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not underlie the constructive discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 148.  There are also statements throughout the <i>Suders</i> opinion that are flatly inconsistent with the reading that the majority suggests.  For example, it points out that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation is \xe2\x80\x9cassimilated to a formal discharge\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c<i>remedial purposes</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d without mentioning liability.  <i>Id</i>.<i>,</i> at 141 (emphasis added); see also <i>id.,</i> at 147, n.\xc2\xa08 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9ca prevailing constructive discharge plaintiff is entitled to all damages available for formal discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cbackpay\xe2\x80\x9d and sometimes \xe2\x80\x9cfrontpay\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> at 148 (\xe2\x80\x9ca constructive discharge is functionally the same as an actual termination in <i>damages-enhancing respects</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  In short, <i>Suders</i> does not resolve whether constructive discharge depends on the underlying discriminatory act.  And, it does not hold that constructive discharge is a cause of action that is distinct from the underlying discrimination claim.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority today not only exploits <i>Suders</i>\xe2\x80\x99 imprecision about whether constructive discharge is an independent claim, but also takes advantage of that opinion\xe2\x80\x99s ambig-uity as to what an employee must establish to invoke the doctrine<i>.  </i>In <i>Suders</i>, I objected to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the constructive-discharge doctrine encompasses those situations in which \xe2\x80\x9cworking conditions become so intolerable that a reasonable person in the employee\xe2\x80\x99s position would have felt compelled to resign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 141.  That description does \xe2\x80\x9cnot in the least resemble actual discharge\xe2\x80\x9d because it permits an employee \xe2\x80\x9cto allege a constructive discharge absent any adverse employment action\xe2\x80\x9d and absent any employer intent to cause a resignation.  <i>Id.,</i> at 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite the <i>Suders</i> Court\xe2\x80\x99s overly broad description of the doctrine, the Court at least retained some focus on an employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The Court in <i>Suders</i> explained that whether to \xe2\x80\x9cassimilat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d a constructive discharge \xe2\x80\x9cto a formal discharge for remedial purposes\xe2\x80\x9d entailed an \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry that focused on the \xe2\x80\x9cworking conditions\xe2\x80\x9d themselves.  <i>Id.,</i> at 141.  And, it held that an employer could raise certain affirmative defenses to stave off liability when no official action forced an employee to resign.  <i>Id.,</i> at 147.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today, the majority goes even further than <i>Suders </i>in eviscerating the limitations on the constructive-discharge doctrine.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule transforms constructive discharge into a claim focused on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, instead of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s.  Green does not allege that, after he signed the settlement agreement, any other act\xe2\x80\x94by a supervisor or even a co-worker\xe2\x80\x94occurred or otherwise immediately precipitated his decision to quit.  See App. 19, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb683\xe2\x80\x9385.<b> </b>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding\xe2\x80\x94that Green\xe2\x80\x99s claim accrued when he resigned\xe2\x80\x94must rest then on Green\xe2\x80\x99s own subjective feelings about the forced settlement.  By ignoring the date on which an employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory act occurred and instead focusing only on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s subjective response to that discriminatory act (see <i>ante,</i> at 12\xe2\x80\x9314), the majority dispenses with the function of an employer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The effect of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, then, is that constructive discharge no longer involves any sort of objective inquiry.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I cannot agree.  The concept of constructive discharge is already on tenuous footing.  It is not based on the text of Title VII but instead on the fiction that an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation can be attributed to his employer in limited circumstances.  As initially conceived by the NLRB, this fictitious attribution could be justified if an employer\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful employment practice \xe2\x80\x9c<i>standing alone</i>, render[ed] an employee\xe2\x80\x99s resignation reasonable and [thus] entitle[d] the employee to backpay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shuck, 23 Berkeley J. Empl. &amp; Lab.

Such attribution cannot be justified, however, where\xe2\x80\x94as here\xe2\x80\x94the constructive discharge accrues based solely on an employee\xe2\x80\x99s subjective response to alleged discrimination.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because Green has not proffered any evidence that discrimination continued to occur after he signed the settlement agreement, his contact with EEOC was untimely under 29 CFR \xc2\xa71614.105.
