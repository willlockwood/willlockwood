S. 30</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JOHNSON, J., delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>In deciding on this cause, the Court will confine itself to the case made out on the 7th exception.  Its decision on the point presented by that exception disposes of the case finally.</p>\n<p>The opinion prayed for was that by taking in, at Fogo, an additional cargo, not sanctioned by the contract of insurance, the insurers were discharged from their liability under the policy.  The charge delivered by the court was that the subsequent liability of the underwriters must depend upon the question whether any increase of risk resulted from the shipping of that additional cargo.</p>\n<p>In this charge, this Court is of opinion that the court below erred.</p>\n<p>The discharge of the underwriters from their liability in such cases depends not upon any supposed increase of risk, but wholly on the departure of the insured from the contract of insurance.  The consequences of such violation of the contract are immaterial to its legal effect, as it is <em>per se</em> a discharge of the underwriters, and the law attaches no importance to the degree in cases of voluntary deviation; necessity alone can sanction a deviation in any case, and that deviation must be strictly commensurate with the <em>vis major</em> producing it.  The case of <em>Rayne v. Bell</em> has been cited as supporting a contrary doctrine.</p>\n<p>Without being understood to acquiesce in the correctness of that decision, it may be remarked that the question was not, in that case, whether the lading, taken in at Gibraltar, was within the terms of the policy, as in the present, but what acts were lawful to be done during the delay occasioned by a justifiable cause of deviation.  On the contrary, the case of <em>Sheriff v. Potts</em> was a case of voluntary departure from the stipulations of the policy, and the decision supports the opinion we now give.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 11 U. S. 31</a></p><p> It may also be remarked that in the case of <em>Rayne v. Bell,</em> the notice which Lord Ellenborough takes of the case of <em>Sheriff and Potts</em> virtually admits the doctrine upon which this Court founds its decision.</p>\n<p>The terms of this policy, so far as connected with this decision, are "with liberty of touching at the Cape de "Verd Islands on her outward passage for stock and "to take in water."  Touching, in its nautical sense, is known to be the most restrictive word that can be adopted in such a case.  Construing the license according to the subject matter, and in its necessary connection with the offer on the freight, it could mean no more than permission to provision the vessel with livestock, such as is usual on a voyage, and may be procured at the Cape de Verds.</p>\n<p>It might, indeed, admit of a doubt whether any of the larger animals used for food were included within the policy.  The words of the first offer certainly were intended to confine the permission to the smaller animals.  "Stock" is a term of the most general import.  In its present extended application, it would include a great variety of subjects that never could have entered into contemplation of the parties.</p>\n<p>In what sense was the term used is the question to be decided, not what uses it might have been applied to in other contracts or between other parties.  The general want of precision in the language of maritime contracts is an endless source of litigation among mercantile men.  Courts of justice are therefore obliged to resort to such reasons as the nature, object, and terms of the contract present to determine the precise extent of the obligation of the parties.</p>\n<p>We feel no inclination to add to the number of causes which vitiate a policy, but the amount of the premium depends upon such a variety of considerations (as often suggested by caprice as by judgment) that the contract, whatever it is, must be substantially adhered to.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
