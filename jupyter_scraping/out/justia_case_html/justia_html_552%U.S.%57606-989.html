S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9311, provides expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards.  Under \xc2\xa79, a court \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d confirm an award \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d it is vacated, modified, or corrected \xe2\x80\x9cas prescribed\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11.  Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, including where the award was procured by \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cundue means,\xe2\x80\x9d and where the arbitrators were \xe2\x80\x9cguilty of misconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under \xc2\xa711, the grounds for modifying or correcting an award include \xe2\x80\x9cevident material miscalculation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevident material mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect[ions] in [a] matter of form not affecting the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a bench trial sustained respondent tenant\xe2\x80\x99s (Mattel) right to terminate its lease with petitioner landlord (Hall Street), the parties proposed to arbitrate Hall Street\xe2\x80\x99s claim for indemnification of the costs of cleaning up the lease site.  The District Court approved, and entered as an order, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreement, which, <em>inter alia,</em> required the court to vacate, modify, or correct any award if the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions of law were erroneous.  The arbitrator decided for Mattel, but the District Court vacated the award for legal error, expressly invoking the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s legal-error review standard and citing the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>LaPine </em>decision for the proposition that the FAA allows parties to draft a contract dictating an alternative review standard.  On remand, the arbitrator ruled for Hall Street, and the District Court largely upheld the award, again applying the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulated review standard.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding the case controlled by its <em>Kyocera </em>decision, which had overruled <em>LaPine</em> on the ground that arbitration-agreement terms fixing the mode of judicial review are unenforceable, given the exclusive grounds for vacatur and modification provided by FAA \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11.   </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The FAA\xe2\x80\x99s grounds for prompt vacatur and modification of awards are exclusive for parties seeking expedited review under the FAA.  The Court rejects Hall Street\xe2\x80\x99s two arguments to the contrary.  First, Hall Street submits that expandable judicial review has been accepted as the law since Wilko</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/427/index.html">346 U. S. 427</a>.  Although a <em>Wilko</em> statement\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe interpretations of the law by the arbitrators <em>in contrast to manifest disregard</em> are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 436\xe2\x80\x93437 (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94arguably favors Hall Street\xe2\x80\x99s position, arguable is as far as it goes.  Quite apart from the leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the <em>Wilko</em> statement expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s legal errors.  Moreover, <em>Wilko</em>\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing is too vague to support Hall Street\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, since \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard\xe2\x80\x9d can be read as merely referring to the \xc2\xa710 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U. S. 614</a>, 656, or as shorthand for the \xc2\xa710 subsections authorizing vacatur when arbitrators were \xe2\x80\x9cguilty of misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is motivated by a congressional desire to enforce such agreements.  <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/index.html">470 U. S. 213</a>, 220.  This argument comes up short because, although there may be a general policy favoring arbitration, the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review once the arbitration is over.  Even assuming \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand their uniformly narrow stated grounds to the point of legal review generally.  But \xc2\xa79 makes evident that expanding \xc2\xa710\xe2\x80\x99s and \xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x99s detailed categories at all would rub too much against the grain: \xc2\xa79 carries no hint of flexibility in unequivocally telling courts that they \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d confirm an arbitral award, \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d it is vacated or modified \xe2\x80\x9cas prescribed\xe2\x80\x9d by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11.  Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9311 as the substance of a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration\xe2\x80\x99s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.  <em>Dean Witter, supra,</em> at 217, 219, distinguished.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0In holding the \xc2\xa710 and \xc2\xa711 grounds exclusive with regard to enforcement under the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s expedited judicial review mechanisms, this Court decides nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of awards.  Accordingly, this case must be remanded for consideration of independent issues.  Because the arbitration agreement was entered into during litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of litigation procedure, and was adopted by the court as an order, there is some question whether it should be treated as an exercise of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to manage its cases under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 16.  This Court ordered supplemental briefing on the issue, but the parties\xe2\x80\x99 supplemental arguments implicate issues that have not been considered previously in this litigation and could not be well addressed for the first time here.  Thus, the Court expresses no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.   </p>\n<p align="left">196 Fed.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq.</em>, provides for expedited judicial review to confirm, vacate, or modify arbitration awards.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9311 (2000 ed. and Supp. V).  The question here is whether statutory grounds for prompt vacatur and modification may be supplemented by contract.  We hold that the statutory grounds are exclusive.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case began as a lease dispute between landlord, petitioner Hall Street Associates, L. L. C., and tenant, respondent Mattel, Inc.  The property was used for many years as a manufacturing site, and the leases provided that the tenant would indemnify the landlord for any costs resulting from the failure of the tenant or its predecessor lessees to follow environmental laws while using the premises.  App. 88\xe2\x80\x9389.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tests of the property\xe2\x80\x99s well water in 1998 showed high levels of trichloroethylene (TCE), the apparent residue of manufacturing discharges by Mattel\xe2\x80\x99s predecessors between 1951 and 1980.  After the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) discovered even more pollutants, Mattel stopped drawing from the well and, along with one of its predecessors, signed a consent order with the DEQ providing for cleanup of the site.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Mattel gave notice of intent to terminate the lease in 2001, Hall Street filed this suit, contesting Mattel\xe2\x80\x99s right to vacate on the date it gave, and claiming that the lease obliged Mattel to indemnify Hall Street for costs of cleaning up the TCE, among other things.  Following a bench trial before the United States District Court for the District of Oregon, Mattel won on the termination issue, and after an unsuccessful try at mediating the indemnification claim, the parties proposed to submit to arbitration.  The District Court was amenable, and the parties drew up an arbitration agreement, which the court approved and entered as an order.  One paragraph of the agreement provided that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he United States District Court for the District of Oregon may enter judgment upon any award, either by confirming the award or by vacating, modifying or correcting the award.  The Court shall vacate, modify or correct any award: (i) where the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s findings of facts are not supported by substantial evidence, or (ii) where the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions of law are erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 16a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nArbitration took place, and the arbitrator decided for Mattel.  In particular, he held that no indemnification was due, because the lease obligation to follow all applicable federal, state, and local environmental laws did not require compliance with the testing requirements of the Oregon Drinking Water Quality Act (Oregon Act); that Act the arbitrator characterized as dealing with human health as distinct from environmental contamination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hall Street then filed a District Court Motion for Order Vacating, Modifying And/Or Correcting the arbitration decision, App. 4, on the ground that failing to treat the Oregon Act as an applicable environmental law under the terms of the lease was legal error.  The District Court agreed, vacated the award, and remanded for further consideration by the arbitrator.  The court expressly invoked the standard of review chosen by the parties in the arbitration agreement, which included review for legal error, and cited <em>LaPine Technology Corp.</em> v. <em>Kyocera Corp.</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa03d 884, 889 (CA9 1997), for the proposition that the FAA leaves the parties \xe2\x80\x9cfree . . . to draft a contract that sets rules for arbitration and dictates an alternative standard of review.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the arbitrator followed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling that the Oregon Act was an applicable environmental law and amended the decision to favor Hall Street.  This time, each party sought modification, and again the District Court applied the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulated standard of review for legal error, correcting the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of interest but otherwise upholding the award.  Each party then appealed to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, where Mattel switched horses and contended that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s recent en banc action overruling <em>LaPine</em> in <em>Kyocera Corp.</em> v. <em>Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 987, 1000 (2003), left the arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s provision for judicial review of legal error unenforceable.  Hall Street countered that <em>Kyocera</em> (the later one) was distinguishable, and that the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s judicial review provision was not severable from the submission to arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit reversed in favor of Mattel in holding that, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder <em>Kyocera</em> the terms of the arbitration agreement controlling the mode of judicial review are unenforceable and severable.\xe2\x80\x9d  113 Fed. Appx. 272, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (2004).  The Circuit instructed the District Court on remand to</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9creturn to the application to confirm the original arbitration award (not the subsequent award revised after reversal), and \xe2\x80\xa6 confirm that award, unless \xe2\x80\xa6 the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 273.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAfter the District Court again held for Hall Street and the Ninth Circuit again reversed,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] we granted certiorari to decide whether the grounds for vacatur and modification provided by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 of the FAA are exclusive.  550 U. S. __ (2007).  We agree with the Ninth Circuit that they are, but vacate and remand for consideration of independent issues.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress enacted the FAA to replace judicial indisposition to arbitration with a \xe2\x80\x9cnational policy favoring [it] and plac[ing] arbitration agreements on equal footing with all other contracts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cardegna</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/440/index.html">546 U. S. 440</a>, 443 (2006).  As for jurisdiction over controversies touching arbitration, the Act does nothing, being \xe2\x80\x9csomething of an anomaly in the field of federal-court jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d in bestowing no federal jurisdiction but rather requiring an independent jurisdictional basis.  <em>Moses H. Cone Memorial Hospital</em> v. <em>Mercury Constr. Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/1/index.html">460 U. S. 1</a>, 25, n.\xc2\xa032 (1983); see, <em>e.g.</em>, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74 (providing for action by a federal district court \xe2\x80\x9cwhich, save for such [arbitration] agreement, would have jurisdiction under title 28\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But in cases falling within a court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, the Act makes contracts to arbitrate \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable, and enforceable,\xe2\x80\x9d so long as their subject involves \xe2\x80\x9ccommerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72.  And this is so whether an agreement has a broad reach or goes just to one dispute, and whether enforcement be sought in state court or federal.  See <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Southland Corp.</em> v. <em>Keating</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/1/index.html">465 U. S. 1</a>, 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (1984).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act also supplies mechanisms for enforcing arbitration awards: a judicial decree confirming an award, an order vacating it, or an order modifying or correcting it.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9311.  An application for any of these orders will get streamlined treatment as a motion, obviating the separate contract action that would usually be necessary to enforce or tinker with an arbitral award in court.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  \xc2\xa76.  Under the terms of \xc2\xa79, a court \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d confirm an arbitration award \xe2\x80\x9cunless\xe2\x80\x9d it is vacated, modified, or corrected \xe2\x80\x9cas prescribed\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11.  Section 10 lists grounds for vacating an award, while \xc2\xa711 names those for modifying or correcting one.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Courts of Appeals have split over the exclusiveness of these statutory grounds when parties take the FAA shortcut to confirm, vacate, or modify an award, with some saying the recitations are exclusive, and others regarding them as mere threshold provisions open to expansion by agreement.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As mentioned already, when this litigation started, the Ninth Circuit was on the threshold side of the split, see <em>LaPine</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889, from which it later departed en banc in favor of the exclusivity view, see <em>Kyocera,</em> 341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1000, which it followed in this case, see 113 Fed. Appx., at 273.  We now hold that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 respectively provide the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive grounds for expedited vacatur and modification.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Hall Street makes two main efforts to show that the grounds set out for vacating or modifying an award are not exclusive, taking the position, first, that expandable judicial review authority has been accepted as the law since <em>Wilko</em> v. <em>Swan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/346/427/index.html">346 U. S. 427</a> (1953).  This, however, was not what <em>Wilko</em> decided, which was that \xc2\xa714 of the Securities Act of 1933 voided any agreement to arbitrate claims of violations of that Act, see <em>id.</em>, at 437\xe2\x80\x93438, a holding since overruled by <em>Rodriguez de Quijas</em> v. <em>Shearson/American Express, Inc</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/477/index.html">490 U. S. 477</a>, 484 (1989).  Although it is true that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion includes some language arguably favoring Hall Street\xe2\x80\x99s position, arguable is as far as it goes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Wilko</em> Court was explaining that arbitration would undercut the Securities Act\xe2\x80\x99s buyer protections when it remarked (citing FAA \xc2\xa710) that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ower to vacate an [arbitration] award is limited,\xe2\x80\x9d 346 U. S., at 436, and went on to say that \xe2\x80\x9cthe interpretations of the law by the arbitrators in contrast to manifest disregard [of the law] are not subject, in the federal courts, to judicial review for error in interpretation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 436\xe2\x80\x93437.  Hall Street reads this statement as recognizing \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard of the law\xe2\x80\x9d as a further ground for vacatur on top of those listed in \xc2\xa710, and some Circuits have read it the same way.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>McCarthy </em>v. <em>Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.</em>, 463 F.\xc2\xa03d 87, 91 (CA1 2006); <em>Hoeft</em> v. <em>MVL Group, Inc.</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 57, 64 (CA2 2003); <em>Prestige Ford</em> v. <em>Ford Dealer Computer Servs.</em>, <em>Inc.,</em> 324 F.\xc2\xa03d 391, 395\xe2\x80\x93396 (CA5 2003); <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Prudential Securities, Inc.</em>, 141 F.\xc2\xa03d 1007, 1017 (CA11 1998).  Hall Street sees this supposed addition to \xc2\xa710 as the camel\xe2\x80\x99s nose: if judges can add grounds to vacate (or modify), so can contracting parties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this is too much for <em>Wilko</em> to bear.  Quite apart from its leap from a supposed judicial expansion by interpretation to a private expansion by contract, Hall Street overlooks the fact that the statement it relies on expressly rejects just what Hall Street asks for here, general review for an arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s legal errors.  Then there is the vagueness of <em>Wilko</em>\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing.  Maybe the term \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard\xe2\x80\x9d was meant to name a new ground for review, but maybe it merely referred to the \xc2\xa710 grounds collectively, rather than adding to them.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mitsubishi Motors Corp.</em> v. <em>Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/614/index.html">473 U. S. 614</a>, 656 (1985) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cArbitration awards are only reviewable for manifest disregard of the law, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710, 207\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>I/S Stavborg</em> v. <em>National Metal Converters, Inc.</em>, 500 F.\xc2\xa02d 424, 431 (CA2 1974).  Or, as some courts have thought, \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest disregard\xe2\x80\x9d may have been shorthand for \xc2\xa710(a)(3) or \xc2\xa710(a)(4), the subsections authorizing vacatur when the arbitrators were \xe2\x80\x9cguilty of misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexceeded their powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kyocera</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 997.  We, when speaking as a Court, have merely taken the <em>Wilko </em>language as we found it, without embellishment, see <em>First Options of Chicago, Inc.</em> v. <em>Kaplan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/938/index.html">514 U. S. 938</a>, 942 (1995), and now that its meaning is implicated, we see no reason to accord it the significance that Hall Street urges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Hall Street says that the agreement to review for legal error ought to prevail simply because arbitration is a creature of contract, and the FAA is \xe2\x80\x9cmotivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties ha[ve] entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.</em> v. <em>Byrd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/213/index.html">470 U. S. 213</a>, 220 (1985).  But, again, we think the argument comes up short.  Hall Street is certainly right that the FAA lets parties tailor some, even many features of arbitration by contract, including the way arbitrators are chosen, what their qualifications should be, which issues are arbitrable, along with procedure and choice of substantive law.  But to rest this case on the general policy of treating arbitration agreements as enforceable as such would be to beg the question, which is whether the FAA has textual features at odds with enforcing a contract to expand judicial review following the arbitration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To that particular question we think the answer is yes, that the text compels a reading of the \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 categories as exclusive.  To begin with, even if we assumed \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 could be supplemented to some extent, it would stretch basic interpretive principles to expand the stated grounds to the point of evidentiary and legal review generally.  Sections 10 and 11, after all, address egregious departures from the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreed-upon arbitration: \xe2\x80\x9ccorruption,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfraud,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevident partiality,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmisconduct,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmisbehavior,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexceed[ing]\xe2\x80\xa6 powers,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevident material miscalculation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cevident material mistake,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9caward[s] upon a matter not submitted;\xe2\x80\x9d the only ground with any softer focus is \xe2\x80\x9cimperfect[ions],\xe2\x80\x9d and a court may correct those only if they go to \xe2\x80\x9c[a] matter of form not affecting the merits.\xe2\x80\x9d  Given this emphasis on extreme arbitral conduct, the old rule of <em>ejusdem generis</em> has an implicit lesson to teach here.  Under that rule, when a statute sets out a series of specific items ending with a general term, that general term is confined to covering subjects comparable to the specifics it follows.  Since a general term included in the text is normally so limited, then surely a statute with no textual hook for expansion cannot authorize contracting parties to supplement review for specific instances of outrageous conduct with review for just any legal error.  \xe2\x80\x9cFraud\xe2\x80\x9d and a mistake of law are not cut from the same cloth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That aside, expanding the detailed categories would rub too much against the grain of the \xc2\xa79 language, where provision for judicial confirmation carries no hint of flexibility.  On application for an order confirming the arbitration award, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmust grant\xe2\x80\x9d the order \xe2\x80\x9cunless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected as prescribed in sections 10 and 11 of this title.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is nothing malleable about \xe2\x80\x9cmust grant,\xe2\x80\x9d which unequivocally tells courts to grant confirmation in all cases, except when one of the \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed\xe2\x80\x9d exceptions applies.  This does not sound remotely like a provision meant to tell a court what to do just in case the parties say nothing else.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In fact, anyone who thinks Congress might have understood \xc2\xa79 as a default provision should turn back to \xc2\xa75 for an example of what Congress thought a default provision would look like:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[i]f in the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an arbitrator\xe2\x80\xa6 such method shall be followed; but if no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto shall fail to avail himself of such method, \xe2\x80\xa6 then upon the application of either party to the\ncontroversy the court shall designate and appoint an\narbitrator\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f no method be provided\xe2\x80\x9d is a far cry from \xe2\x80\x9cmust grant \xe2\x80\xa6 unless\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa79.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of fighting the text, it makes more sense to see the three provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79\xe2\x80\x9311, as substantiating a national policy favoring arbitration with just the limited review needed to maintain arbitration\xe2\x80\x99s essential virtue of resolving disputes straightaway.  Any other reading opens the door to the full-bore legal and evidentiary appeals that can \xe2\x80\x9crende[r] informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kyocera</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 998; cf. <em>Ethyl Corp.</em> v. <em>United Steelworkers of America</em>, 768 F.\xc2\xa02d 180, 184 (CA7 1985),\nand bring arbitration theory to grief in post-arbitration process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is <em>Dean Witter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/213/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/213/index.html">470 U. S. 213</a>, to the contrary, as Hall Street claims it to be.  <em>Dean Witter</em> held that state-law claims subject to an agreement to arbitrate could not be remitted to a district court considering a related, nonarbitrable federal claim; the state-law claims were to go to arbitration immediately.  <em>Id</em>., at 217.  Despite the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s language \xe2\x80\x9creject[ing] the suggestion that the overriding goal of the [FAA] was to promote the expeditious resolution of claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 219, the holding mandated immediate enforcement of an arbitration agreement; the Court was merely trying to explain that the inefficiency and difficulty of conducting simultaneous arbitration and federal-court litigation was not a good enough reason to defer the arbitration, see <em>id</em>., at 217.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When all these arguments based on prior legal authority are done with, Hall Street and Mattel remain at odds over what happens next.  Hall Street and its <em>amici</em> say parties will flee from arbitration if expanded review is not open to them.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Brief for Petitioner 39; Brief for New England Legal Foundation et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15.  One of Mattel\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> foresees flight from the courts if it is.  See Brief for U. S. Council for Int\xe2\x80\x99l Business as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 29\xe2\x80\x9330.  We do not know who, if anyone, is right, and so cannot say whether the exclusivity reading of the statute is more of a threat to the popularity of arbitrators or to that of courts.  But whatever the consequences of our holding, the statutory text gives us no business to expand the statutory grounds.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In holding that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 provide exclusive regimes for the review provided by the statute, we do not purport to say that they exclude more searching review based on authority outside the statute as well.  The FAA is not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards: they may contemplate enforcement under state statutory or common law, for example, where judicial review of different scope is arguable.  But here we speak only to the scope of the expeditious judicial review under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa79, 10, and 11, deciding nothing about other possible avenues for judicial enforcement of arbitration awards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although one such avenue is now claimed to be revealed in the procedural history of this case, no claim to it was presented when the case arrived on our doorstep, and no reason then appeared to us for treating this as anything but an FAA case.  There was never any question about meeting the FAA \xc2\xa72 requirement that the leases from which the dispute arose be contracts \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72; see <em>Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos.</em> v. <em>Dobson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/265/index.html">513 U. S. 265</a>, 277 (1995) (\xc2\xa72 \xe2\x80\x9cexercise[s] Congress\xe2\x80\x99 commerce power to the full\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor is there any doubt now that the parties at least had the FAA in mind at the outset; the arbitration agreement even incorporates FAA \xc2\xa77, empowering arbitrators to compel attendance of witnesses.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 13a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While it is true that the agreement does not expressly invoke FAA \xc2\xa79, \xc2\xa710, or \xc2\xa711, and none of the various motions to vacate or modify the award expressly said that the parties were relying on the FAA, the District Court apparently thought it was applying the FAA when it alluded to the Act in quoting <em>LaPine</em>, 130 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889, for the then-unexceptional proposition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[f]ederal courts can expand their review of an arbitration award beyond the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s grounds, when \xe2\x80\xa6 the parties have so agreed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 46a.  And the Ninth Circuit, for its part, seemed to take it as a given that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s direct and prompt examination of the award depended on the FAA; it found the expanded-review provision unenforceable under <em>Kyocera</em> and remanded for confirmation of the original award \xe2\x80\x9cunless the district court determines that the award should be vacated on the grounds allowable under 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa710, or modified or corrected under the grounds allowable under 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa711.\xe2\x80\x9d  113 Fed. Appx., at 273.  In the petition for certiorari and the principal briefing before us, the parties acted on the same premise.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Pet. for Cert. 27 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis Court should accept review to resolve this important issue of statutory construction under the FAA\xe2\x80\x9d); Brief for Petitioner 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause arbitration provisions providing for judicial review of arbitration awards for legal error are consistent with the goals and policies of the FAA and employ a standard of review which district courts regularly apply in a variety of contexts, those provisions are entitled to enforcement under the FAA\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One unusual feature, however, prompted some of us to question whether the case should be approached another way.  The arbitration agreement was entered into in the course of district-court litigation, was submitted to the District Court as a request to deviate from the standard sequence of trial procedure, and was adopted by the District Court as an order.  See App. 46\xe2\x80\x9347; App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a\xe2\x80\x938a.  Hence a question raised by this Court at oral argument: should the agreement be treated as an exercise of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to manage its cases under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 16?  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Tr. of Oral Arg. 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  Supplemental briefing at the Court\xe2\x80\x99s behest joined issue on the question, and it appears that Hall Street suggested something along these lines in the Court of Appeals, which did not address the suggestion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are, however, in no position to address the question now, beyond noting the claim of relevant case management authority independent of the FAA.  The parties\xe2\x80\x99 supplemental arguments on the subject in this Court implicate issues of waiver and the relation of the FAA both to Rule 16 and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of 1998, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7651 <em>et seq</em>., none of which has been considered previously in this litigation, or could be well addressed for the first time here.  We express no opinion on these matters beyond leaving them open for Hall Street to press on remand.  If the Court of Appeals finds they are open, the court may consider whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to manage litigation independently warranted that court\xe2\x80\x99s order on the mode of resolving the indemnification issues remaining in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we agree with the Ninth Circuit that the FAA confines its expedited judicial review to the grounds listed in 9 U.

It is a peculiar argument, converting agreement as a necessary condition for judicial enforcement into a sufficient condition for a court to bar enforcement.  And the text is otherwise problematical for Hall Street: \xc2\xa79 says that if the parties have agreed to judicial enforcement, the court \xe2\x80\x9cmust grant\xe2\x80\x9d confirmation unless grounds for vacatur or modification exist under \xc2\xa710 or \xc2\xa711.  The sentence nowhere predicates the court\xe2\x80\x99s judicial action on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 having agreed to specific standards; if anything, it suggests that, so long as the parties contemplated judicial enforcement, the court must undertake such enforcement under the statutory criteria.  In any case, the arbitration agreement here did not specifically predicate entry of judgment on adherence to its judicial-review standard.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 15a.  To the extent Hall Street argues otherwise, it contests not the meaning of the FAA but the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s severability analysis, upon which it did not seek certiorari.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The history of the FAA is consistent with our conclusion.  The text of the FAA was based upon that of New York\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration statute.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 536, 68th Cong., 1st Sess., 3 (1924) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe bill \xe2\x80\xa6 follows the lines of the New York arbitration law enacted in 1920 \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  The New York Arbitration Law incorporated pre-existing provisions of the New York Code of Civil Procedure.  See 1920 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Laws p. 806.  Section 2373 of the code said that, upon application by a party for a confirmation order, \xe2\x80\x9cthe court must grant such an order, unless the award is vacated, modified, or corrected, as prescribed by the next two sections.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 N.\xc2\xa0Y. Ann. Code Civ. Proc. (Stover 6th ed. 1902) (hereinafter Stover).  The subsequent sections gave grounds for vacatur and modification or correction virtually identical to the 9 U.

This section, which is the centerpiece of the FAA, reflects Congress\xe2\x80\x99 main goal in passing the legislation: \xe2\x80\x9cto abrogate the general common-law rule against specific enforcement of arbitration agreements,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Southland Corp.</em> v. <em>Keating</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/1/index.html">465 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1984) (Stevens, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), and to \xe2\x80\x9censur[e] that private arbitration agreements are enforced according to their terms,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Volt Information Sciences, Inc.</em> v. <em>Board of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/468/index.html">489 U. S. 468</a>, 478 (1989).  Given this settled understanding of the core purpose of the FAA, the interests favoring enforceability of parties\xe2\x80\x99 arbitration agreements are stronger today than before the FAA was enacted.  As such, there is more\xe2\x80\x94and certainly not less\xe2\x80\x94reason to give effect to parties\xe2\x80\x99 fairly negotiated decisions to provide for judicial review of arbitration awards for errors of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner filed this rather complex action in an Oregon state court.  Based on the diverse citizenship of the parties, respondent removed the case to federal court.  More than three years later, and after some issues had been resolved, the parties sought and obtained the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approval of their agreement to arbitrate the remaining issues subject to <em>de novo </em>judicial review.  They neither requested, nor suggested that the FAA authorized, any \xe2\x80\x9cexpedited\xe2\x80\x9d disposition of their case.  Because the arbitrator made a rather glaring error of law, the judge refused to affirm his award until after that error was corrected.  The Ninth Circuit reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court now agrees with the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s (most recent) interpretation of the FAA as setting forth the exclusive grounds for modification or vacation of an arbitration award under the statute.  As I read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it identifies two possible reasons for reaching this result: (1) a supposed <em>quid pro quo</em> bargain between Congress and litigants that conditions expedited federal enforcement of arbitration awards on acceptance of a statutory limit on the scope of judicial review of such awards; and (2) an assumption that Congress intended to include the words \xe2\x80\x9cand no other\xe2\x80\x9d in the grounds specified in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 for the vacatur and modification of awards.  Neither reason is persuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While \xc2\xa79 of the FAA imposes a 1-year limit on the time in which any party to an arbitration may apply for confirmation of an award, the statute does not require that the application be given expedited treatment.  Of course, the premise of the entire statute is an assumption that the arbitration process may be more expeditious and less costly than ordinary litigation, but that is a reason for interpreting the statute liberally to favor the parties\xe2\x80\x99 use of arbitration.  An unnecessary refusal to enforce a perfectly reasonable category of arbitration agreements defeats the primary purpose of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That purpose also provides a sufficient response to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on statutory text.  It is true that a wooden application of \xe2\x80\x9cthe old rule of <em>ejusdem generis</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante, </em>at 9, might support an inference that the categories listed in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 are exclusive, but the literal text does not compel that reading\xe2\x80\x94a reading that is flatly inconsistent with the overriding interest in effectuating the clearly expressed intent of the contracting parties.  A listing of grounds that must always be available to contracting parties simply does not speak to the question whether they may agree to additional grounds for judicial review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in light of the historical context and the broader purpose of the FAA, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 are best understood as a shield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cvalid, irrevocable and enforceable\xe2\x80\x9d agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if I thought the narrow issue presented in this case were as debatable as the conflict among the courts of appeals suggests, I would rely on a presumption of overriding importance to resolve the debate and rule in favor of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s position that the FAA permits the statutory grounds for vacatur and modification of an award to be supplemented by contract.  A decision \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not to regulate</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the terms of an agreement that does not even arguably offend any public policy whatsoever, \xe2\x80\x9cis adequately justified by a presumption in favor of freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>FCC</em> v. <em>Beach Communications, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/307/index.html">508 U.

In \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa710 and 11 of the FAA, Congress significantly limited the grounds for judicial vacatur or modification of such awards in order to protect arbitration awards from hostile and meddlesome courts.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962592">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nBREYER, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nHALL STREET ASSOCIATES, L.L.C.

Pet. for Cert. i.  Like the majority and Justice Stevens, and primarily for the reasons they set forth, I believe that the Act does not <em>preclude </em>enforcement of such an agreement.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13 (opinion of the Court) (The Act \xe2\x80\x9cis not the only way into court for parties wanting review of arbitration awards\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (The Act is a \xe2\x80\x9cshield meant to protect parties from hostile courts, not a sword with which to cut down parties\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98valid, irrevocable and enforceable\xe2\x80\x99 agreements to arbitrate their disputes subject to judicial review for errors of law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, I see no need to send the case back for further judicial decisionmaking.  The agreement here was entered into with the consent of the parties and the approval of the District Court.  Aside from the Federal Arbitration Act itself, 9 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq.</em>, respondent below pointed to no statute, rule, or other relevant public policy that the agreement might violate.  The Court has now rejected its argument that the agreement violates the Act, and I would simply remand the case with instructions that the Court of Appeals affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment enforcing the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s final award.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
