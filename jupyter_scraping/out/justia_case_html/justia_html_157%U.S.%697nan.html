The petitioner alleged that he was convicted June 15, 1894, of the murder of William Kairer in said court, and on October 13th was sentenced to be hanged December 13th; that afterwards, on November 19th, application was made to the Chancellor of the State of New Jersey for a writ of error to remove the judgment and the proceedings therein to the Supreme Court of New Jersey, which was denied; that December 4th, application was made to the governor for a reprieve to suspend the execution of the judgment, which reprieve was granted on that day, and thereby the execution of the mandate of the court was suspended until January 3.

And it was further averred that on the twenty-second day of December, application was made to one of the justices of the Supreme Court of Judicature of the State of New Jersey for a writ of habeas corpus, to be relieved of the unlawful restraint of his liberty, and that the application was denied, and petitioner was refused an appeal from the same contrary to the federal and state constitutions; that on the twenty-fourth of December an application was made to the chief justice of said supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the death warrant issued by the governor, and that the same was refused, and an appeal from said refusal and hearing therein were denied, contrary to and in violation of said constitutions.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  The Constitution of New Jersey provides that the governor shall have power "to grant reprieves to extend until the expiration of a time not exceeding ninety days, after conviction."  Art. V, \xc2\xa7 9, 2 Charters and Constitution 1318.  The verdict was returned June 15.  Sentence was passed October 13, and a reprieve for thirty days was granted December 4, 1894.  Appellant contends that the word "conviction" relates to the verdict of the jury, and not to the sentence of the court, and that therefore the governor had no power to grant the reprieve, nor subsequently to issue the warrant of execution.  But the contention that petitioner cannot be made to pay the penalty for the crime of which he was adjudged guilty because he was not executed at the time originally designated by reason of the interposition of the governor at his instance, which petitioner alleges was, as matter of construction of the state constitution, unauthorized, was not sustained by the chief justice of the state nor by the associate justice of its supreme court, to whom, severally, he applied, and their action is not open to review here.  With the disposition of state questions by the appropriate state authorities it is not the province of this Court to interfere, and there is no basis for the suggestion of any violation of the Constitution of the United States, the denial of due process of law, or deprivation of any right, privilege, or immunity secured to him by the Constitution or laws of the United States.  <em>Hallinger v.
