Mter his prison sentence began, the Bureau of Prisons (BOP) relied on its established policy in refusing to credit toward his sentence the time he had spent at the treatment center. He exhausted his administrative remedies and then filed a federal habeas corpus petition. A District Court denied his petition on the ground that his stay at the center was not "official detention" under \xc2\xa7 3585(b). In reversing, the Court of Appeals declined to defer to BOP\'s view that time spent under highly restrictive conditions while "released" on bail is not "official detention" because a "released" defendant is not subject to BOP\'s control.

The provision reduces a defendant\'s "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent in "official detention" before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the presentence "detention" period must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. And nothing suggests that when Congress replaced \xc2\xa7 3568 with \xc2\xa7 3585(b), it substituted the phrase "official detention" for "in custody" because it disagreed with the Courts of Appeals\' uniform rule that \xc2\xa7 3568 denied credit to defendants released on bail.

But even then, it is not the only plausible interpretation. Respondent correctly notes that a defendant "released" to a treatment center could be subject to restraints that do not materially differ from those imposed on a "detained" defendant who is assigned to a treatment center as part of his sentence. However, that fact does not undercut the important distinction between all defendants "detained" and all defendants "released" on bail: The former always remain completely subject to BOP\'s control. The Court of Appeals\' alternative construction would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the circumstances of confinement in each case to determine whether a defendant "released" on bail was subjected to "jail-type confinement." On the other hand, the Government\'s construction provides both it and a defendant with clear notice of the consequences of a "release" or "detention" order. Finally, the rule of lenity does not apply here. A statute is not "ambiguous" for purposes of the rule merely because there is a division of judicial authority over its proper construction.

Before the commencement of respondent\'s federal sentence, a Federal Magistrate Judge "released" him on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984 and ordered him confined to a community treatment center.

On June 18, 1991, he pleaded guilty to that charge in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. One week later, on June 25, 1991, a Federal Magistrate Judge entered a "release order" pursuant to 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3142(c), ordering respondent released on bail, pending sentencing, into the custody of the Pretrial Services</p><p><i>*Charles D.

The order required that he be "confined to [the] premises" of a Volunteers of America community treatment center without "authoriz[ation] to leave for any reason unless accompanied" by a Government special agent. On October 22, 1991, the District Court sentenced respondent to 41 months\' imprisonment. Respondent remained at the Volunteers of America facility until November 25, 1991, the day he reported to the Allenwood Federal Prison Camp to serve his sentence.</p><p>Respondent requested the Bureau of Prisons (BOP or Bureau) to credit toward his sentence of imprisonment the approximately 150 days he spent at the Volunteers of America community treatment center between June 25 and November 25, 1991. Relying on its established policy, BOP refused to grant the requested credit. After exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent filed a petition for habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania seeking credit under 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3585 for the time he spent at the community treatment center. The District Court denied the petition, finding that respondent\'s stay at the center did not constitute "official detention" within the meaning of 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3585(b).</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/21/558/">21 F.3d 558</a> (1994). It acknowledged that the overwhelming majority of the Courts of Appeals "have concluded that section 3585 ... does not require the Bureau to credit presentenced defendants whose bail conditions allowed them to be confined outside of Bureau of Prison[s] facilities." <i>Id., </i>at 561. The court declined, however, to defer to the Bureau\'s view-that time spent under highly restrictive conditions while "released" on bail is not "\'official detention\'" under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) because a "\'released\'" defendant is not subject to the Bureau\'s control. <i>Id., </i>at 562-565. Instead, the court reasoned that \xc2\xa7 3585(b)\'s " \'official detention\'" language need not be read "as if it provided \'official detention <i>by the Attorney General or the Bureau of Prisons,\'" </i>since "there is noth-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="54">54</a></p><p>ing in the statute which requires or suggests that a defendant must be under the detention of the Bureau," and since "[a] court may \'detain\' a person as \'official[lyJ\' as the Attorney General." <i>Id., </i>at 563-564. Concluding that "\'official detention\' for purposes of credit under 18 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 3585 includes time spent under conditions of jail-type confinement," id., at 567, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for a determination whether respondent was in "jail-type confinement" during his stay at the Volunteers of America community treatment center.</p><p>We granted the Government\'s petition for certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the question whether a federal prisoner is entitled to credit against his sentence under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) for time when he was "released" on bail pursuant to the Bail Reform Act of 1984.1 513 U. s. 1106 (1995).

Respondent, on the other hand, argues that the phrase "official detention" includes the restrictive conditions of his release on bail because the Federal Magistrate\'s bail order was "official" and significantly curtailed his liberty. Viewing the phrase in isolation, it may be said that either reading is plausible. But it is a "fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used." <i>Deal </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/508/129/case.html">508 U. S. 129</a>, 132 (1993). After examining the phrase "official detention" in this light, we believe the Government\'s interpretation is the correct one.</p><p>Section 3585(b) provides credit for time "spent in official detention <i>prior to the date the sentence commences," 18 </i>U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3585(b) (emphasis added), thus making clear that credit is awarded only for <i>presentence </i>restraints on liberty. Because the Bail Reform Act of 1984, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3141 <i>et </i>seq., is the body of law that authorizes federal courts to place presentence restraints on a defendant\'s liberty, see \xc2\xa7 3142(a) (authorizing courts to impose restraints on the defendant "pending trial"); \xc2\xa7 3143(a) (authorizing courts to impose restraints while the defendant "is waiting imposition or execution of sentence"), the "official detention" language of \xc2\xa7 3585(b) must be construed in conjunction with that Act. This is especially so because the Bail Reform Act of 1984 was enacted in the same statute as the Sentencing Reform Act of</p><p>ment is not properly before the Court.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 3142(a), or who "has been found guilty of an offense and ... is awaiting imposition or execution of sentence," 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3143(a)(1) (1988 ed., Supp. V). The court may either (1) "release" the defendant on bail or (2) order him "detained" without bail. A court may "release" a defendant subject to a variety of restrictive conditions, including residence in a community treatment center. See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3142(c) (l)(B)(i), (x), and (xiv). If, however, the court "finds that no condition or combination of conditions will reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the safety of any other person and the community," \xc2\xa7 3142(e), the court "shall order the detention of the person," <i>ibid., </i>by issuing a "detention order" "direct[ing] that the person be committed to the custody of the Attorney General for confinement in a corrections facility," \xc2\xa7 3142(i)(2). Thus, under the language of the Bail Reform Act of 1984, a defendant suffers "detention" only when committed to the custody of the Attorney General; a defendant admitted to bail on restrictive conditions, as respondent was, is "released."

Section 3585(a) provides that a federal sentence "commences" when the defendant is received for transportation to or arrives at "the official detention facility at which the sentence is to be served." Title 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3621, in turn, provides that the sentenced defendant "shall be committed to the custody of the Bureau of Prisons," \xc2\xa7 3621(a), which <i>"may designate any available penal or correctional facility ... , </i>whether maintained by the Federal Government or otherwise ... , that the Bureau determines to be appropriate and suitable," \xc2\xa7 3621(b) (emphasis added). The phrase "official detention facility" in \xc2\xa7 3585(a) therefore must refer to a correctional facility designated by the Bureau for the service of federal sentences, where the Bureau retains the discretion to "direct the transfer of a prisoner from one penal or correctional facility to another." \xc2\xa7 3621(b).</p><p>This reading of \xc2\xa7 3585(a) is reinforced by other provisions governing the administration of federal sentences. For example, \xc2\xa7 3622 gives the Bureau authority to release a prisoner from the place of his imprisonment for a limited period to "participate in a training or educational program in the community while continuing in official detention at the prison facility," \xc2\xa7 3622(b), or to "work at paid employment in the community while continuing in official detention at the penal or correctional facility," \xc2\xa7 3622(c). Because the words "official detention" should bear the same meaning in subsections (a) and (b) of \xc2\xa7 3585 as they do in the above related sentencing statutes, see <i>Estate of Cowart </i>v. <i>Nicklos Drilling Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/469/case.html">505 U. S. 469</a>, 479 (1992) ("[T]he basic canon of statutory construction [is] that identical terms within an Act bear the same meaning"), credit for time spent in "official detention" under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) is available only to those defendants who were detained in a "penal or correctional facility," \xc2\xa7 3621(b), and who were subject to BOP\'s control.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="59">59</a></p><p>The context and history of \xc2\xa7 3585(b) also support this view.</p><p>As for context, \xc2\xa7 3585(b) reduces a defendant\'s "imprisonment" by the amount of time spent in "official detention" before his sentence, strongly suggesting that the period of presentence "detention" must be equivalent to the "imprisonment" itself. It would be anomalous to interpret \xc2\xa7 3585(b) to require sentence credit for time spent confined in a community treatment center where the defendant is not subject to BOP\'s control, since Congress generally views such a restriction on liberty as part of a sentence of "probation," see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3563(b)(10), (12), and (14), or "supervised release," see \xc2\xa7 3583(d), rather than part of a sentence of "imprisonment." See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Zackular, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/945/423/">945 F.2d 423</a>, 425 (CA1 1991).</p><p>With respect to history, \xc2\xa7 3585(b)\'s predecessor, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3568 (1982 ed.) (repealed), required the Attorney General to award sentence credit for "any days spent <i>in custody </i>in connection with the offense or acts for which sentence was imposed." (Emphasis added.) The Courts of Appeals uniformly held that the phrase "in custody" did not allow sentence credit because of restrictions placed on a defendant\'s liberty as a condition of release on bail. See <i>Polakoff </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/489/727/">489 F.2d 727</a>, 730 (CA5 1974) (time spent on "highly restricted bond" not creditable as "\'custody\' "); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Robles, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/563/1308/">563 F.2d 1308</a>, 1309 (CA9 1977) ("[T]ime spent on bail or on bond pending appeal is not time served \'in custody\' "), cert. denied, 435 U.

In thus rewording the credit statute, however, nothing suggests that Congress disagreed with the Courts of Appeals\' rule denying credit to defendants who had been released on bail. To the contrary, Congress presumably made the change to conform the credit statute to the nomenclature used in related sentencing provisions, see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3585(a) and 3622, and in the Bail Reform Act of 1984.

A person under these circumstances remains in \'official detention,\' subject to the discretion of the Attorney General and the U. S. Marshals Service with respect to the place of detention. Those defendants placed in a program and/or residence as a condition of detention are subject to removal and return to a more secure environment at the discretion of the Attorney General and the U.

It is true that the Bureau\'s interpretation appears only in a "Program Statemen[t]"-an internal agency guideline-rather than in "published regulations subject to the rigors of the Administrative Procedur[e] Act, including public notice and comment." 21 F. 3d, at 562. But BOP\'s internal agency guideline, which is akin to an "interpretive rule" that "do[es] not require notice and comment," <i>Shalala </i>v. <i>Guernsey Memorial Hospital, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/514/87/case.html">514 U. S. 87</a>, 99 (1995), is still entitled to some deference, cf. <i>Martin </i>v. <i>Occupational Safety and Health Review Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/144/case.html">499 U. S. 144</a>, 157 (1991), since it is a "permissible construction of the statute," <i>Chevron U. </i>S. <i>A. Inc. </i>v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/case.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843 (1984).</p><p>Respondent, as we have indicated, disagrees with the above interpretation of \xc2\xa7 3585(b). He contends that the "plain meaning" of the phrase "official detention" includes the restrictive conditions of his confinement, even though he</p><p>from detention with a requirement of program participation and/or residence.</p><p>"A defendant is not eligible for any credits while <i>released </i>from detention. Time spent in residence in a community corrections center as a result of the <i>Pretrial Services Act of </i>1982 (18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3152-3154), or as a result of a condition of bail or bond (18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3141-3143), is not creditable as presentence time. A condition of bail or bond which is \'highly restrictive,\' and that includes \'house arrest\', \'electronic monitoring\' or \'home confinement\'; or such as requiring the defendant to report daily to the U. S. Marshal, U. S. Probation Service, or other person; is not considered as time in official detention. Such a defendant is not subject to the discretion of the U. S. Attorney General, the Bureau of Prisons, or the U. S. Marshals Service, regarding participation, placement, or subsequent return to a more secure environment, and therefore is not in a status which would indicate an award of credit is appropriate (see <i>Randall </i>v. <i>Whelan, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/938/522/">938 F.2d 522</a> (4th Cir. 1991) and <i>U. </i>S.

This contention is a plausible one if the phrase is read in isolation: respondent was subjected to restrictive conditions when released on bail, these conditions were imposed by a court order, and his sojourn in the community treatment center therefore amounted to "official detention." But even without reference to the context of the language and the history of the statute, respondent\'s is not the only plausible interpretation of the language; it would be too much to say that the statute "cannot bear the interpretation adopted by" the Bureau. <i>Sullivan </i>v. <i>Everhart, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/83/case.html">494 U. S. 83</a>, 91-92 (1990). And in light of the foregoing textual and historical analysis, the initial plausibility of respondent\'s reading simply does not carry the day.</p><p>Respondent also argues it is improper to focus on the release/detention dichotomy of the Bail Reform Act of 1984 to construe \xc2\xa7 3585(b)\'s "official detention" language because a defendant "released" on bail may be subjected to conditions (under 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3142(c)(1)(B)(xiv)) that are just as onerous as those faced by "detained" defendants. In addition, he asserts that his confinement as a "released" defendant in the Volunteers of America community treatment center constituted "official detention" because "sentenced" prisoners are deemed to be in "official detention" when BOP authorizes them to serve the last part of their sentences in a community treatment center, see U. S. Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Prisons Program Statement No. 7310.02 (Oct. 19, 1993) (interpreting 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3624(c) to allow BOP to place sentenced prisoners in community corrections centers, since such centers meet 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3621(b)\'s definition of a "penal or correctional facility"), or to serve their sentences on educational or work release, see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3622(b) and (c).</p><p>It is quite true that under the Government\'s theory a defendant "released" to a community treatment center could be subject to restraints which do not materially differ from those imposed on a "detained" defendant committed to the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="63">63</a></p><p>custody of the Attorney General, and thence assigned to a treatment center. But this fact does not undercut the remaining distinction that exists between <i>all </i>defendants committed to the custody of the Attorney General on the one hand, and <i>all </i>defendants released on bail on the other. Unlike defendants "released" on bail, defendants who are "detained" or "sentenced" <i>always remain subject to the control of the Bureau. </i>See <i>Randall </i>v. <i>Whelan, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/938/522/">938 F.2d 522</a>, 525 (CA4 1991). This is an important distinction, as the identity of the custodian has both legal and practical significance. A defendant who is "released" is not in BOP\'s custody, and he cannot be summarily reassigned to a different place of confinement unless a judicial officer revokes his release, see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3148(b), or modifies the conditions of his release, see \xc2\xa7 3142(c)(3). A defendant who is "detained," however, is completely subject to BOP\'s control. And "[t]hat single factor encompasses a wide variety of restrictions." <i>Randall, supra, </i>at 525. "Detained" defendants are subject to BOP\'s disciplinary procedures; they are subject to summary reassignment to any other penal or correctional facility within the system, cf. <i>Meachum </i>v. <i>Fano, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html">427 U. S. 215</a>, 224-229 (1976); and, being in the legal custody of BOP, the Bureau has full discretion to control many conditions of their confinement. See <i>Moody </i>v. <i>Daggett, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/78/case.html">429 U. S. 78</a>,88, n. 9 (1976); <i>Bell </i>v. <i>Wolfish, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/520/case.html">441 U. S. 520</a>, 544-548 (1979).5</p><p>5 In some cases, a defendant will be arrested, denied bail, and held in custody pursuant to state law, being turned over later to the Federal Government for prosecution. In these situations, BOP often grants credit under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) for time spent in <i>state </i>custody, see, <i>e. </i>g., U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Operations Memorandum (Oct. 23, 1989); U. S. Dept. of Justice, Federal Bureau of Prisons, Sentence Computation Manual CCCA (1992 and Supp. 1994), even though the defendant was <i>not </i>subject to the control of BOP. These situations obviously are not governed by reference to a \xc2\xa7 3142 "release" or "detention" order. But because the only question before us is whether a defendant is in "official detention" under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) during the time he is "released" on bail pursu-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="64">64</a></p><p>It may seem unwise policy to treat defendants differently for purposes of sentence credit under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) when they are similarly situated in fact-the one is confined to a community treatment center after having been "detained" and committed to the Bureau\'s custody, while the other is "released" to such a center on bail. But the alternative construction adopted by the Court of Appeals in this case has its own grave difficulties. To determine in each case whether a defendant "released" on bail was subjected to "jail-type confinement" would require a fact-intensive inquiry into the circumstances of confinement, an inquiry based on information in the hands of private entities not available to the Bureau as a matter of right. Even were such information more readily available, it seems certain that the phrase "jail-type confinement" would remain sufficiently vague and amorphous so that much the same kind of disparity in treatment for similarly situated defendants would arise. The Government\'s construction of \xc2\xa7 3585(b), on the other hand, provides both it and the defendant with clear notice of the consequences of a \xc2\xa7 3142 "release" or "detention" order.</p><p>Respondent finally suggests that the rule of lenity requires adoption of the "jail-type confinement" test for purposes of calculating credit under \xc2\xa7 3585(b) because "there is a split of authority in the Circuits concerning the reach of \'official detention,\'" Brief for Respondent 34, n. 13, and because there is ambiguity as to which forms of custody fall within the meaning of "\'official detention.\'" See id., at 34.

I write separately to point out that Koray has not argued before us that he did not elect bail intelligently, i. <i>e., </i>with comprehension that time in the halfway house, unlike time in jail, would yield no credit against his eventual sentence. The Court thus does not foreclose the possibility that the fundamental fairness we describe as "due process" calls for notice and a comprehension check. Cf. Fed. Rule Crim.

The order of confinement-euphemistically styled a "release" order-provided that respondent "shall not be authorized to leave for any reason unless accompanied by Special Agent Dennis Bass." Brief for Respondent 3. While at VOA, respondent "had to account for his presence five times a day, he was subject to random breath and urine tests, his access to visitors was limited in both time and manner, and there was a paucity of vocational, educational, and recreational services compared to a prison facility." <i>Koray </i>v. <i>Sizer, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/21/558/">21 F.3d 558</a>, 566 (CA3 1994). Except for one off-site medical exam, respondent remained at VOA 24 hours a day for 150 days.

However, proof that confinement under \xc2\xa7 3142 or \xc2\xa7 3585(a) constitutes official detention certainly is not proof that no other form of confinement can constitute official detention. The majority thus fails to demonstrate that respondent should not receive sentencing credit for his court-ordered full-time confinement in a jailtype facility.</p><p>Moreover, the Court\'s restrictive interpretation creates an anomalous result. Under the Court\'s view that only a person "committed to the custody of the Attorney General" can be in "official detention," \xc2\xa7 3585(b) does not authorize any credit for time spent in state custody, "no matter how restrictive the conditions." <i>Ante, </i>at 60, 63-64, n. 5.

The majority cannot have it both ways.</p><p>Given the anomalous implications of the Court\'s decision, one may fairly question how the majority justifies its result. It is surely not the plain language of the statute, because the majority\'s reading requires that a judicially mandated, 24-hour-a-day confinement in a jail-type facility is neither "official" (because it is ordered by a judge and not the Attorney General) nor "detention" (because the judicial order is labeled "release"). Nor does the majority rely on the nature of the facility itself, because the majority concedes that if the Attorney General rather than the court had confined respondent in the exact same facility, respondent\'s confinement would have been "official detention" under the statute. The majority purports to rely on some sort of <i>Chevron </i>deference, <i>ante, </i>at 61, but it is indeed an odd sort of deference given that (as I have noted above) the majority adopts an interpretation that the Bureau of Prisons itself has rejected.</p><p>The majority suggests at one point that it relies on the history of the interpretation of the word "custody," arguing that Congress did not intend to change the settled meaning of "custody" that existed prior to the Bail Reform Act. However, not one of the cases cited by the majority, <i>ante, </i>at 59, stands for the proposition that custody does not include confinement in a jail-type facility. Instead, all of those cases involved situations in which the defendant was <i>at large. </i>See <i>Polakoffv. United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/489/727/">489 F.2d 727</a>, 730 (CA5 1974) (defendant faced "travel and social restrictions and was required to report weekly to a probation officer"); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Robles, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/563/1308/">563 F.2d 1308</a>, 1309 (CA9 1977) (defendant required to "obey all laws, remain within the jurisdiction unless court permission was granted to travel, obey all court orders, and keep his attorney posted as to his address and employment"); <i>Ortega </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/510/412/">510 F.2d 412</a>, 413</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="69">69</a></p><p>(CAlO 1975) ("released on personal recognizance"); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Peterson, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/507/1191/">507 F.2d 1191</a>, 1192 (CADC 1974) (defendant "at large on conditional release"). Moreover, at least one Court of Appeals (albeit after the passage of the Bail Reform Act) interpreted the word "custody" under \xc2\xa7 3568 as including "enforced residence under conditions approaching those of incarceration." <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Rison, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/895/533/">895 F.2d 533</a>, 536 (CA9 1990). Thus, though I agree with the majority that Congress intended to incorporate the understanding of "custody" that existed under \xc2\xa7 3568, I fail to see how that intention supports the majority\'s result.</p><p>Simply accepting the plain meaning of the statutory text would avoid the anomalies created by the Court\'s opinion, would effectuate the intent of Congress, and would provide fair treatment for defendants who will otherwise spend more time in custody than Congress has deemed necessary or appropriate. For these reasons, I agree with the persuasive opinion of the Court of Appeals and would affirm its judgment.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
