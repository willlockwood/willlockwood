The libel alleged that the injury was caused by coal negligently permitted to fall from a steel hoisting bucket.</p>\n<p>Relying upon the California Workmen\'s Compensation Act of 1913, the Industrial Accident Commission granted an award in favor of the widow and children, which the supreme court of the state annulled August 6, 1917 -- a year and a day subsequent to the death.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter, August 21st, the widow and children began an admiralty suit <em>in personam</em> against the petitioner in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, wherein they alleged that the accident resulted from its negligence and prayed for damages. Later respondent, having been appointed administrator, filed an amended libel with like allegations and prayer, and upon this the cause was ultimately tried.  Petitioner denied liability and relied upon \xc2\xa7 340, subsection 3, California Code of Civil Procedure, which requires that an action for damages consequent upon death caused by wrongful act, or negligence shall be brought within one year. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/233/case.html">*</a></span> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 257 U.

At the common law, no civil action lies for an injury resulting from death.  The maritime law as generally accepted by maritime nations leaves the matter untouched, and in practice, each of them has applied the same rule for the sea which it maintains on land.  <em>The Harrisburg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/case.html#204">119 U.

This Court affirmed the judgment.  Whether an admiralty court could have entertained a proceeding based upon the statute was mooted, but not determined.</p>\n<p><em>Sherlock v.

The defense rested primarily upon the erroneous theory that the statute encroached upon the commercial powers of Congress.  There was no discussion of the point now directly presented.

Stewart,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/253/149/case.html">253 U. S. 149</a></span>, we have recently discussed the theory under which the general maritime law became a part of our national law, and pointed out the inability of the states to change its general features so as to defeat uniformity -- but the power of a state to make some modifications or supplements was affirmed.  And we further held that rights and liabilities in respect of torts upon the sea ordinarily depend upon the rules accepted and applied in admiralty courts which are controlling wherever suit may be instituted.  Under this view, <em>American Steamboat Co. v. Chace</em> and <em>Sherlock v. Alling</em> support the right to recover under a local statute in an admiralty court for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 257 U. S. 242</a></p><p> death occurring on navigable waters within the state when caused by tort there committed.</p>\n<p>As the logical result of prior decisions, we think it follows that, where death upon such waters follows from a maritime tort committed on navigable waters within a state whose statutes give a right of action on account of death by wrongful act, the admiralty courts will entertain a libel <em>in personam</em> for the damages sustained by those to whom such right is given.  The subject is maritime and local in character, and the specified modification of or supplement to the rule applied in admiralty courts when following the common law will not work material prejudice to the characteristic features of the general maritime law, nor interfere with the proper harmony and uniformity of that law in its international and interstate relations.  <em>Southern Pacific Co. v. Jensen, supra.</em></p>\n<p>The California Code of Civil Procedure, \xc2\xa7 340, prescribes one year as the period within which an action for death caused by wrongful action or negligence shall be brought.  It is admitted that, under the circumstances here presented, suit against petitioner, if instituted in a court of that state, would have been barred, and we are of opinion that the same limitation must be enforced in respect of the admiralty proceeding.  It was so decided in <em>The Harrisburg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/case.html#213">119 U. S. 213</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/199/case.html#214">119 U. S. 214</a></span>, a proceeding <em>in rem</em> begun in the United States District Court, Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The steamer belonged to the port of Philadelphia, where she was duly enrolled, and the accident occurred upon navigable waters within Massachusetts.  The Pennsylvania statute permitted suit for damages resulting from death, and provided that "the action shall be brought within one year from the death, and not thereafter."  The Massachusetts statute provided that, in case of death resulting from the wrongful action of a corporation, the executor might recover by indictment a fine not exceeding $5,000, and further, that indictments </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 257 U. S. 243</a></p><p> against a corporation for loss of life shall be prosecuted within one year from the injury causing the death.  Through Mr. Chief Justice Waite, this Court said:</p>\n<p>"The statutes create a new legal liability, with the right to a suit for its enforcement, provided the suit is brought within twelve months, and not otherwise.  The time within which the suit must be brought operates as a limitation of the liability itself as created, and not of the remedy alone.  It is a condition attached to the right to sue at all.  No one will pretend that the suit in Pennsylvania, or the indictment in Massachusetts, could be maintained if brought or found after the expiration of the year, and it would seem to be clear that, if the admiralty adopts the statute as a rule of right to be administered within its own jurisdiction, it must take the right subject to the limitations which have been made a part of its existence.  It matters not that no rights of innocent parties have attached during the delay.  Time has been made of the essence of the right, and the right is lost if the time is disregarded.  The liability and the remedy are created by the same statutes, and the limitations of the remedy are therefore to be treated as limitations of the right."</p>\n<p><em>See also Davis v.

It expressly directs:</p>\n<p>"That the provisions of any state statute giving or regulating rights of action of remedies for death shall not be affected by this Act.
