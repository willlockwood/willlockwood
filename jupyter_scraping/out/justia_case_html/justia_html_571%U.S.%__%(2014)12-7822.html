They knocked on the apartment door, which was answered by Roxanne Rojas, who appeared to be battered and bleeding.  When the officers asked her to step out of the apartment so that they could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner came to the door and objected.  Suspecting that he had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed petitioner from the apartment and placed him under arrest.  He was then identified as the perpetrator in the earlier robbery and taken to the police station.  An officer later returned to the apartment and, after obtaining Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 oral and written consent, searched the premises, where he found several items linking petitioner to the robbery.  The trial court denied petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress that evidence, and he was convicted.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  It held that because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented to the search, the exception to permissible warrantless consent searches of jointly occupied premises that arises when one of the occupants present objects to the search, Georgia v. Randolph,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n, did not apply, and therefore, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suppression motion had been properly denied.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0Randolph does not extend to this situation, where Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 consent was provided well after petitioner had been removed from their apartment.

Bustamonte,\n\n412 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93232, and are clearly reasonable when the consent comes from the sole occupant of the premises.  When multiple occupants are involved, the rule extends to the search of the premises or effects of an absent, nonconsenting occupant so long as \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over [the] premises or effects\xe2\x80\x9d is obtained.  United States v. Matlock,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164\n.  However, when \xe2\x80\x9ca physically present inhabitan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d refuses to consent, that refusal \xe2\x80\x9cis dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Randolph, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122\xe2\x80\x93123.  A controlling factor in Randolph was the objecting occupant\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence.  See, e.g., id., at 106, 108, 109, 114.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends that, though he was not present when Rojas consented, Randolph nevertheless controls, but neither of his arguments is sound.

Dictum in Randolph suggesting that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121, is best understood to refer to situations in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively reasonable.  Petitioner does not contest the fact that the police had reasonable grounds for his removal or the existence of probable cause for his arrest.  He was thus in the same position as an occupant absent for any other reason.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (2)\xc2\xa0Petitioner also argues that the objection he made while at the threshold remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew it.  This is inconsistent with Randolph in at least two important ways.  It cannot be squared with the \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary social usage\xe2\x80\x9d upon which Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s holding was based.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111, 121.  It also creates the sort of practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid by adopting a \xe2\x80\x9cformalis[tic]\xe2\x80\x9d rule, id., at 121, e.g., requiring that the scope of an objection\xe2\x80\x99s duration and the procedures necessary to register a continuing objection be defined.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (c)\xc2\xa0Petitioner claims that his expansive interpretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where officers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they also have probable cause to obtain a warrant to search the premises that the objector does not want them to enter.  But he misunderstands the constitutional status of consent searches, which are permissible irrespective of the availability of a warrant.  Requiring officers to obtain a warrant when a warrantless search is justified may interfere with law enforcement strategies and impose an unmerited burden on the person willing to consent to an immediate search.

See United States v. Matlock,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164 (1974)\n.  In Georgia v. Randolph,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103 (2006)\n, we recognized a narrow exception to this rule, holding that the consent of one occupant is insufficient when another occupant is present and objects to the search.  In this case, we consider whether Randolph applies if the objecting occupant is absent when another occupant consents.  Our opinion in Randolph took great pains to emphasize that its holding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is physically present.  We therefore refuse to extend Randolph to the very different situation in this case, where consent was provided by an abused woman well after her male partner had been removed from the apartment they shared.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The events involved in this case occurred in Los Angeles in October 2009.  After observing Abel Lopez cash a check, petitioner Walter Fernandez approached Lopez and asked about the neighborhood in which he lived.  When Lopez responded that he was from Mexico, Fernandez laughed and told Lopez that he was in territory ruled by the \xe2\x80\x9cD.F.S.,\xe2\x80\x9d i.e., the \xe2\x80\x9cDrifters\xe2\x80\x9d gang.  App. 4\xe2\x80\x935.  Petitioner then pulled out a knife and pointed it at Lopez\xe2\x80\x99 chest.  Lopez raised his hand in self-defense, and petitioner cut him on the wrist.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lopez ran from the scene and called 911 for help, but petitioner whistled, and four men emerged from a nearby apartment building and attacked Lopez.  After knocking him to the ground, they hit and kicked him and took his cell phone and his wallet, which contained $400 in cash.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A police dispatch reported the incident and mentioned the possibility of gang involvement, and two Los Angeles police officers, Detective Clark and Officer Cirrito, droveto an alley frequented by members of the Drifters.  A man who appeared scared walked by the officers and said: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he guy is in the apartment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 5.  The officers then observed a man run through the alley and into the building to which the man was pointing.  A minute or two later, the officers heard sounds of screaming and fighting coming from that building.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After backup arrived, the officers knocked on the door of the apartment unit from which the screams had been heard.  Roxanne Rojas answered the door.  She was holding a baby and appeared to be crying.  Her face was red, and she had a large bump on her nose.  The officers also saw blood on her shirt and hand from what appeared to be a fresh injury.  Rojas told the police that she had been in a fight.  Officer Cirrito asked if anyone else was in the apartment, and Rojas said that her 4-year-old son was the only other person present.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After Officer Cirrito asked Rojas to step out of the apartment so that he could conduct a protective sweep, petitioner appeared at the door wearing only boxer shorts.  Apparently agitated, petitioner stepped forward and said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98You don\xe2\x80\x99t have any right to come in here. I know my rights.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 6.  Suspecting that petitioner had assaulted Rojas, the officers removed him from the apartmentand then placed him under arrest.  Lopez identified petitioner as his initial attacker, and petitioner was taken to the police station for booking.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Approximately one hour after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, Detective Clark returned to the apartment and informed Rojas that petitioner had been arrested.  Detective Clark requested and received both oral and written consent from Rojas to search the premises.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  In the apartment, the police found Drifters gang paraphernalia, a butterfly knife, clothing worn by the robbery suspect, and ammunition.  Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 young son also showed the officers where petitioner had hidden a sawed-off shotgun.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner was charged with robbery, Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa7211 (West 2008), infliction of corporal injury on a spouse, cohabitant, or child\xe2\x80\x99s parent, \xc2\xa7273.5(a), possession of a firearm by a felon, \xc2\xa712021(a)(1)(West 2009), possession of a short-barreled shotgun, \xc2\xa712020(a)(1), and felony possession of ammunition, \xc2\xa712316(b)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Before trial, petitioner moved to suppress the evidence found in the apartment, but after a hearing, the court denied the motion.  Petitioner then pleaded nolo conten-dere to the firearms and ammunition charges.  On the re-maining counts\xe2\x80\x94for robbery and infliction of corporal injury\xe2\x80\x94he went to trial and was found guilty by a jury.  The court sentenced him to 14 years of imprisonment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  208 Cal. App. 4th 100, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d 51 (2012).  Because Randolph did not overturn our prior decisions recognizing that an occupant may give effective consent to search a shared residence, the court agreed with the majority of the federal circuits that an objecting occupant\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence is \xe2\x80\x9cindispensible to the decision in Randolph.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 122, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 66.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  And because petitioner was not present when Rojas consented, the court held that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suppression motion had been properly denied.  Id., at 121, 145 Cal. Rptr. 3d, at 65.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The California Supreme Court denied the petition for review, and we granted certiorari.  569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The\n \nFourth Amendment prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures and provides that a warrant may not be issued without probable cause, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe text of the\n \nFourth Amendment does not specify when a search warrant must be obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kentucky v. King, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 5).  Our cases establish that a warrant is generally required for a search of a home, Brigham City v. Stuart,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398,\n403 (2006)\n, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate touchstone of the\n \nFourth Amendment is \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ibid.; see also Michigan v. Fisher,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 45,\n47 (2009)\n (\xc2\xa0per curiam).  And certain categories of permissible warrantless searches have long been recognized.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Consent searches occupy one of these categories.  \xe2\x80\x9cConsent searches are part of the standard investigatorytechniques of law enforcement agencies\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9ca con-stitutionally permissible and wholly legitimate aspect of effective police activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,\n\n412 U. S. 218\n\xe2\x80\x93232 (1973).  It would be unreasonable\xe2\x80\x94indeed, absurd\xe2\x80\x94to require police officers to obtain a warrant when the sole owner or occupant of a house or apartment voluntarily consents to a search.  The owner of a home has a right to allow others to enter and examine the premises, and there is no reason why the owner should not be permitted to extend this same privilege to police officers if that is the owner\xe2\x80\x99s choice.  Where the owner believes that he or she is under suspicion, the owner may want the police to search the premises so that their suspicions are dispelled.  This may be particularly important where the owner has a strong interest in the apprehension of the perpetrator of a crime and believes that the suspicions of the police are deflecting the course of their investigation.  An owner may want the police to search even where they lack probable cause, and if a warrant were always required, this could not be done.  And even where the police could establish probable cause, requiring a warrant despite the owner\xe2\x80\x99s consent would needlessly inconvenience everyone involved\xe2\x80\x94not only the officers and the magistrate but also the occupant of the premises, who would generally either be compelled or would feel a need to stay until the search was completed.  Michigan v. Summers,\n\n452 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692,\n701 (1981)\n.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While it is clear that a warrantless search is reasonable when the sole occupant of a house or apartment consents, what happens when there are two or more occupants?  Must they all consent?  Must they all be asked?  Is consent by one occupant enough?  The Court faced that problem 40 years ago in United States v. Matlock,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164 (1974)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In that case, Matlock and a woman named Graff were living together in a house that was also occupied by several of Graff\xe2\x80\x99s siblings and by her mother, who had rentedthe house.  While in the front yard of the house, Matlock was arrested for bank robbery and was placed in a squad car.  Although the police could have easily asked him for consent to search the room that he and Graff shared, they did not do so.  Instead, they knocked on the door and obtained Graff\xe2\x80\x99s permission to search.  The search yielded incriminating evidence, which the defendant sought to suppress, but this Court held that Graff\xe2\x80\x99s consent justified the warrantless search.  As the Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 170.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Illinois v. Rodriguez,\n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177 (1990)\n, the Court reaffirmed and extended the Matlock holding.  In Rodriguez, a woman named Fischer told police officers that she had been assaulted by Rodriguez in what she termed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98our\xe2\x80\x99 apartment.\xe2\x80\x9d  497 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 179.  She also informed the officers that Rodriguez was asleep in the apartment, and she then accompanied the officers to that unit.  When they arrived, the officers could have knocked on the door and awakened Rodriguez, and had they done so, Rodriguez might well have surrendered at the door and objected to the officers\xe2\x80\x99 entry.  Instead, Fischer unlocked the door, the officers entered without a warrant, and they saw drug paraphernalia and containers filled with white powder in plain view.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        After the search, the police learned that Fischer no longer resided at the apartment, and this Court held that she did not have common authority over the premises at the time in question.  The Court nevertheless held that the warrantless entry was lawful because the police reasonably believed that Fischer was a resident.  Id., at 188\xe2\x80\x93189.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While consent by one resident of jointly occupied premises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search, we recognized a narrow exception to this rule in Georgia v. Randolph,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103 (2006)\n.  In that case, police offi-cers responded to the Randolphs\xe2\x80\x99 home after receiving a report of a domestic dispute.  When the officers arrived, Janet Randolph informed the officers that her estranged husband, Scott Randolph, was a cocaine user and that there were \xe2\x80\x9citems of drug evidence\xe2\x80\x9d in the house.  Id., at 107 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The officers first asked Scott for consent to search, but he \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocally refused.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The officers then turned to Janet, and she consented to the search, which produced evidence that was later used to convict Scott for possession of cocaine.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Without questioning the prior holdings in Matlock and Rodriguez, this Court held that Janet Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s consent was insufficient under the circumstances to justify the warrantless search.  The Court reiterated the proposition that a person who shares a residence with others assumes the risk that \xe2\x80\x9cany one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted in his absence by another.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111.  But the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca physically present inhabitant\xe2\x80\x99s express refusal of consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 122\xe2\x80\x93123 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion went to great lengths to make clear that its holding was limited to situations in which the objecting occupant is present.  Again and again, the opinion of the Court stressed this controlling factor.  See id., at 106 (\xe2\x80\x9cpresent at the scene\xe2\x80\x9d); ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9cphysically present\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 108 (\xe2\x80\x9ca co-tenant who is present\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 109 (\xe2\x80\x9cphysically present\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 114 (\xe2\x80\x9ca present and objecting co-tenant\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 119 (a co-tenant \xe2\x80\x9cstanding at the door and expressly refusing consent\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 120 (\xe2\x80\x9ca physically present resident\xe2\x80\x9d), id., at 121 (\xe2\x80\x9ca physically present fellow tenant objects\xe2\x80\x9d); ibid.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion could hardly have been clearer on this point, and the separate opinion filed by Justice Breyer, whose vote was decisive, was equally unambiguous.  See id., at 126 (concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not apply where the objector is not present \xe2\x80\x98and object[ing]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In this case, petitioner was not present when Rojas consented, but petitioner still contends that Randolph is controlling.  He advances two main arguments.  First, he claims that his absence should not matter since he was absent only because the police had taken him away.  Second, he maintains that it was sufficient that he objected to the search while he was still present.  Such an objection, he says, should remain in effect until the objecting party \xe2\x80\x9cno longer wishes to keep the police out of his home.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 8.  Neither of these arguments is sound.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We first consider the argument that the presence of the objecting occupant is not necessary when the police are responsible for his absence.  In Randolph, the Court suggested in dictum that consent by one occupant might not be sufficient if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 121.  We do not believe the statement should be read to suggest that improper motive may invalidate objectively justified removal.  Hence, it does not govern here.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Randolph dictum is best understood not to require an inquiry into the subjective intent of officers who detain or arrest a potential objector but instead to refer to situations in which the removal of the potential objector is not objectively reasonable.  As petitioner acknowledges, see Brief for Petitioner 25, our\n \nFourth Amendment cases \xe2\x80\x9chave repeatedly rejected\xe2\x80\x9d a subjective approach.  Brigham City, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 404 (alteration and internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, we have never held, outside limited contexts such as an \xe2\x80\x98inventory search or administrative inspection .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , that an officer\xe2\x80\x99s motive invalidates objectively justifiable behavior under the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  King, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op.,at 10).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner does not claim that the Randolph Court meant to break from this consistent practice, and we do not think that it did.  And once it is recognized that the test is one of objective reasonableness, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument collapses.  He does not contest the fact that the police had reasonable grounds for removing him from the apartment so that they could speak with Rojas, an apparent victim of domestic violence, outside of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s potentially intimidating presence.  In fact, he does not even contest the existence of probable cause to place him under arrest.  We therefore hold that an occupant who is absent due to a lawful detention or arrest stands in the same shoes as an occupant who is absent for any other reason.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This conclusion does not \xe2\x80\x9cmake a mockery of Randolph,\xe2\x80\x9d as petitioner protests.  Brief for Petitioner 9.  It simply accepts Randolph on its own terms.  The Randolph holding unequivocally requires the presence of the objecting occupant in every situation other than the one mentioned in the dictum discussed above.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This brings us to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s second argument, viz., that his objection, made at the threshold of the premises that the police wanted to search, remained effective until he changed his mind and withdrew his objection.  This argument is inconsistent with Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in at least two important ways.  First, the argument cannot be squared with the \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary social usage\xe2\x80\x9d upon which the Randolph holding was based.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111, 121.  Explaining why consent by one occupant could not override an objection by a physically present occupant, the Randolph Court stated:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of shared premises would have no confidence that one occupant\xe2\x80\x99s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, \xe2\x80\x98stay out.\xe2\x80\x99  Without some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside under those conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 113.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It seems obvious that the calculus of this hypothetical caller would likely be quite different if the objecting tenant was not standing at the door.  When the objecting occupant is standing at the threshold saying \xe2\x80\x9cstay out,\xe2\x80\x9d a friend or visitor invited to enter by another occupant can expect at best an uncomfortable scene and at worst violence if he or she tries to brush past the objector.  But when the objector is not on the scene (and especially when it is known that the objector will not return during the course of the visit), the friend or visitor is much more likely to accept the invitation to enter.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Thus, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument is inconsistent with Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument would create the very sort of practical complications that Randolph sought to avoid.  The Randolph Court recognized that it was adopting a \xe2\x80\x9cformalis[tic]\xe2\x80\x9d rule, but it did so in the interests of \xe2\x80\x9csimple clarity\xe2\x80\x9d and administrability.  Id., at 121, 122.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The rule that petitioner would have us adopt would produce a plethora of practical problems.  For one thing, there is the question of duration.  Petitioner argues that an objection, once made, should last until it is withdrawn by the objector, but such a rule would be unreasonable.  Suppose that a husband and wife owned a house as joint tenants and that the husband, after objecting to a search of the house, was convicted and sentenced to a 15-year prison term.  Under petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule, the wife would be unable to consent to a search of the house 10 years after the date on which her husband objected.  We refuse to stretch Randolph to such strange lengths.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Nor are we persuaded to hold that an objection lasts for a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d time.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is certainly unusual for this Court to set forth precise time limits governing police action,\xe2\x80\x9d Maryland v. Shatzer,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98,\n110 (2010)\n, and what interval of time would be reasonable in this context?  A week?  A month?  A year?  Ten years?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s rule would also require the police and ultimately the courts to determine whether, after the passage of time, an objector still had \xe2\x80\x9ccommon authority\xe2\x80\x9d over the premises, and this would often be a tricky question.  Suppose that an incarcerated objector and a consenting co-occupant were joint tenants on a lease.  If the objector, after incarceration, stopped paying rent, would he still have \xe2\x80\x9ccommon authority,\xe2\x80\x9d and would his objection retain its force?  Would it be enough that his name remainedon the lease?  Would the result be different if the object-ing and consenting lessees had an oral month-to-month tenancy?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Another problem concerns the procedure needed to register a continuing objection.  Would it be necessary for an occupant to object while police officers are at the door?  If presence at the time of consent is not needed, would an occupant have to be present at the premises when the objection was made?  Could an objection be made pre-emptively?  Could a person like Scott Randolph, suspecting that his estranged wife might invite the police to view his drug stash and paraphernalia, register an objection in advance?  Could this be done by posting a sign in front of the house?  Could a standing objection be registered by serving notice on the chief of police?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, there is the question of the particular law enforcement officers who would be bound by an objection.  Would this set include just the officers who were present when the objection was made?  Would it also apply to other officers working on the same investigation?  Would it extend to officers who were unaware of the objection?  How about officers assigned to different but arguably related cases?  Would it be limited by law enforcement agency?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If Randolph is taken at its word\xe2\x80\x94that it applies only when the objector is standing in the door saying \xe2\x80\x9cstay out\xe2\x80\x9d when officers propose to make a consent search\xe2\x80\x94all of these problems disappear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In response to these arguments, petitioner argues that Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of physical presence is not without its own ambiguity.  And we acknowledge that if, as we conclude, Randolph requires presence on the premises to be searched, there may be cases in which the outer boundary of the premises is disputed.  The Court confronted a similar problem last Term in Bailey v. United States, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), but despite arguments similar to those now offered by petitioner, the Court adopted a rule that applies only when the affected individual is near the premises being searched.  Having held that a premises rule is workable in that context, we see no ground for reaching a different conclusion here.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Petitioner argues strenuously that his expansive interpretation of Randolph would not hamper law enforcement because in most cases where officers have probable cause to arrest a physically present objector they also have probable cause to search the premises that the objector does not want them to enter, see Brief for Petitioner 20\xe2\x80\x9323, but this argument misunderstands the constitutional status of consent searches.  A warrantless consent search is reasonable and thus consistent with the\n \nFourth Amendment irrespective of the availability of a warrant.  Even with modern technological advances, the warrant procedure imposes burdens on the officers who wish to search, the magistrate who must review the warrant application, and the party willing to give consent.  Whena warrantless search is justified, requiring the police to obtain a warrant may \xe2\x80\x9cunjustifiably interfer[e] with legitimate law enforcement strategies.\xe2\x80\x9d  King, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).  Such a requirement may also impose an unmerited burden on the person who consents to an immediate search, since the warrant application procedure entails delay.  Putting the exception the Court adopted in Randolph to one side, the lawful occupant of a house or apartment should have the right to invite the police to enter the dwelling and conduct a search.  Any other rule would trample on the rights of the occupant who is willing to consent.  Such an occupant may want the police to search in order to dispel \xe2\x80\x9csuspicion raised by sharing quarters with a criminal.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 116; see also Schneckloth, 412 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 243 (evidence obtained pursuant to a consent search \xe2\x80\x9cmay insure that a wholly innocent person is not wrongly charged with a criminal offense\xe2\x80\x9d).  And an occupant may want the police to conduct a thorough search so that any dangerous contraband can be found and removed.  In this case, for example, the search resulted in the discovery and removal of a sawed-off shotgun to which Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 4-year-old son had access.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Denying someone in Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 position the right to allow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence.  Having beaten Rojas, petitioner would bar her from controlling access to her own home until such time as he chose to relent.  The\n \nFourth Amendment does not give him that power.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The judgment of the California Court of Appeal isaffirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We use the terms \xe2\x80\x9coccupant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cresident,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctenant\xe2\x80\x9d interchangeably to refer to persons having \xe2\x80\x9ccommon authority\xe2\x80\x9d over premises within the meaning of .

Id., at 145 (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o\n \nFourth Amendment search occurs where .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the spouse of an accused voluntarily leads the police to potential evidence of wrongdoing by the accused\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead of deciding the case on that narrow ground, the majority in Randolph looked to \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d to resolve whether the wife\xe2\x80\x99s consent to a search should control over her husband\xe2\x80\x99s objection.

Accordingly, given a blank slate, I would analyze this case consistent with The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent in Randolph: \xe2\x80\x9cA warrantless search is reasonable if police obtain the voluntary consent of a person authorized to give it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 128.

Matlock,\n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 164\n, n.\xc2\xa07 (1974), that a cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to con-sent to a search \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinements.\xe2\x80\x9dSee Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 23.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        I do not think the argument can be so easily dismissed.  To be sure, under Katz v. United States,\n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967)\n, \xe2\x80\x9cproperty rights \xe2\x80\x98are not the sole measure of\n \nFourth Amendment violations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida v. Jardines,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3).  But as we have recently made clear, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Katz reasonable-expectations test \xe2\x80\x98has been added to, not substituted for,\xe2\x80\x99 the traditional property-based understanding of the\n \nFourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.,at ___ (slip op., at 9) (quoting United States v. Jones, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8)).  I would therefore find this a more difficult case if it were established that prop-erty law did not give petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s cotenant the right to admit visitors over petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  That difficulty does not arise, however, because the authorities cited by the amicus association fail to establish that a guest would commit a trespass if one of two joint tenants invited the guest to enter and the other tenant forbade the guest to do so.  Indeed, what limited authority there is on the subject points to the opposite conclusion.  See, e.g., 86 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Tenancy in Common \xc2\xa7144, p. 354 (2006) (a licensee of one tenant \xe2\x80\x9cis not liable in trespass to nonconsenting cotenants\xe2\x80\x9d); Dinsmore v. Renfroe, 66 Cal. App. 207, 212\xe2\x80\x93214, 225 P. 886, 888\xe2\x80\x93889 (1924); Buchanan v.

Tiffany, Real Property \xc2\xa7457, p. 274 (3d ed. 1939) (endorsing the opposite view but acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is little authority\xe2\x80\x9d on the question).  There accordingly is no basis for us to conclude that the police infringed on any property right of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s when they entered the premises with his cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970815">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 12\xe2\x80\x937822</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">WALTER FERNANDEZ, PETITIONER v.

Suppressing the warrant requirement, the Court shrinks to petite size our holding in Georgia v. Randolph,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103 (2006)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9ca physically present inhabitant\xe2\x80\x99s express refusal of consent to a police search [of his home] is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 122\xe2\x80\x93123.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This case calls for a straightforward application of Randolph.  The police officers in Randolph were confronted with a scenario closely resembling the situation presented here.  Once the police arrived at Janet and Scott Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s shared residence, Scott Randolph \xe2\x80\x9cunequivocally refused\xe2\x80\x9d an officer\xe2\x80\x99s request for permission to search their home.  Georgia v. Randolph,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103,\n107 (2006)\n.  The officer then asked Janet Randolph for her consent to the search, which she \xe2\x80\x9creadily gave.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The sequence here was similar.  After Walter Fernandez, while physi-cally present at his home, rebuffed the officers\xe2\x80\x99 request to come in, the police removed him from the premises and then arrested him, albeit with cause to believe he had assaulted his cohabitant, Roxanne Rojas.  At the time of the arrest, Rojas said nothing to contradict Fernandez\xe2\x80\x99 refusal.  About an hour later, however, and with no attempt to obtain a search warrant, the police returned to the apartment and prevailed upon Rojas to sign a consent form authorizing search of the premises.  See infra, at 9, n.\xc2\xa05.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The circumstances triggering \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s traditional hostility to police entry into a home without a warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 126 (Breyer, J., concurring), are at least as salient here as they were in Randolph.  In both cases, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he search at issue was a search solely for evidence\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he objecting party,\xe2\x80\x9d while on the premises, \xe2\x80\x9cmade his objection [to police entry] known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the [residence]\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers might easily have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 125\xe2\x80\x93126.  Here, moreover, with the objector in custody, there was scant danger to persons on the premises, or risk that evidence might be destroyed or concealed, pending request for, and receipt of, a warrant.  See id., at 126.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Despite these marked similarities, the Court removes this case from Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  The Court does so principally by seizing on the fact that Fernandez, unlike Scott Randolph, was no longer present and objecting when the police obtained the co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But Fernandez was present when he stated his objection to the would-be searchers in no uncertain terms.  See App. 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have any right to come in here.  I know my rights.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  The officers could scarcely have forgotten, one hour later, that Fernandez refused consent while physically present.  That express, on-premises objection should have been \xe2\x80\x9cdispositive as to him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Randolph, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 122.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court tells us that the \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary social usage\xe2\x80\x9d undergirding Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s holding apply only when the objector remains physically present.  Ante, at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of social expectations, however, does not hinge on the objector\xe2\x80\x99s physical presence vel\xc2\xa0non at the time of the search.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters,\xe2\x80\x9d Randolph observes, \xe2\x80\x9ca resolution must come through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 113\xe2\x80\x93114.  See also id., at 114 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no common understanding that one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.\xe2\x80\x9d); id., at 115 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he cooperative occupant\xe2\x80\x99s invitation adds nothing to the government\xe2\x80\x99s side to counter the force of an objecting individual\xe2\x80\x99s claim to security against the government\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion into his dwelling place.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Randolph thus trained on whether a joint occupant had conveyed an objection to a visitor\xe2\x80\x99s entry, and did not suggest that the objection could be ignored if the police reappeared post the objector\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A visitor might be less reluctant to enter over a joint occupant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the Court speculates, if that visitor knows the objector will not be there.  See ante, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  \xe2\x80\x9cOnly in a Hobbesian world,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cwould one person\xe2\x80\x99s social obligations to another be limited to what the other[, because of his presence,] is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. able to enforce.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Henderson, 536 F.\xc2\xa03d 776, 787 (CA7 2008) (Rovner, J., dissenting).  Such conjectures about social behavior, at any rate, shed little light on the constitutionality of this warrantless home search, given the marked distinctions between private interactions and police investigations.  Police, after all, have power no private person enjoys.  They can, as this case illustrates, put a tenant in handcuffs and remove him from the premises.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, as the Court comprehended just last Term, \xe2\x80\x9cthe background social norms that invite a visitor to the front door do not invite him there to conduct a search.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florida v. Jardines, \n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 7).  Similarly here, even if shared tenancy were understoodto entail the prospect of visits by unwanted socialcallers while the objecting resident was gone, that un-welcome visitor\xe2\x80\x99s license would hardly include free rein to rummage through the dwelling in search of evidence and contraband.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Next, the Court cautions, applying Randolph to these facts would pose \xe2\x80\x9ca plethora of practical problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  For instance, the Court asks, must a cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, once registered, be respected indefinitely?  Yet it blinks reality to suppose that Fernandez, by withholding consent, could stop police in their tracks eternally.  Cf. ante, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (imagining an objector behind bars serving his sentence, still refusing permission to search hisresidence).  To mount the prosecution eventuating in a conviction, of course, the State would first need to obtain incriminating evidence, and could get it easily simply by applying for a warrant.  Warrant in police hands, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s practical problems disappear.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, as the Court acknowledges, see ante, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, reading Randolph to require continuous physical presence poses administrative difficulties of its own.  Does an occupant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consent lose force as soon as she absents herself from the doorstep, even if only for a moment?  Are the police free to enter the instant after the objector leaves the door to retire for a nap, answer the phone, use the bathroom, or speak to another officer outside?  See Brief for Petitioner 28.  Hypothesized practical considerations, in short, provide no cause for today\xe2\x80\x99s drastic reduction of Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s holding and attendant disregard for the warrant requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In its zeal to diminish Randolph, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision overlooks the warrant requirement\xe2\x80\x99s venerable role as the \xe2\x80\x9cbulwark of\n \nFourth Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Franks v. Delaware,\n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 154,\n164 (1978)\n.  Reducing Randolph to a \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow exception,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court declares the main rule to be that \xe2\x80\x9cconsent by one resident of jointly occupied premises is generally sufficient to justify a warrantless search.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.  That declaration has it backwards, for consent searches themselves are a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98jealously and care-fully drawn\xe2\x80\x99 exception\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nFourth Amendment rule ordinarily prohibiting the warrantless entry of a person\xe2\x80\x99s house as unreasonable per\xc2\xa0se.\xe2\x80\x9d  Randolph, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 109 (quoting Jones v.

Shut from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sight is the ease and speed with which search warrants nowadays can be obtained.  See Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 11) (observing that technology now \xe2\x80\x9callow[s] for the more expeditious processing of warrant applications,\xe2\x80\x9d and citing state statutes permitting warrants to be obtained \xe2\x80\x9cremotely through various means, including telephonic or radio communication, electronic communication .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , and video conferencing\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as Amicus Curiae 29 (describing California\xe2\x80\x99s procedures for electronic warrant applications).

Because the Framers saw the neutral magistrate as an essential part of the criminal process shielding all of us, good or bad, saint or sinner, from unchecked police activity.  See, e.g., Johnson v. United States,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 10\n\xe2\x80\x9314 (1948) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe point of the\n \nFourth Amendment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not that it denies law enforcement the support of the usual inferences which reasonable men draw from evidence.  Its protection consists in requiring that those inferences be drawn by a neutral and detached magistrate instead of being judged by the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe investigation of crime,\xe2\x80\x9d of course, \xe2\x80\x9cwould always be simplified if warrants were unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mincey v.

See also Randolph, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9cA generalized interest in expedient law enforcement cannot, without more, justify a warrantless search.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A final word is in order about the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 autonomy, which, in its view, is best served by allowing her consent to trump an abusive cohabitant\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  See ante, at 15 (\xe2\x80\x9cDenying someone in Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 position the right to allow the police to enter her home would also show disrespect for her independence.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 situation is not distinguishable from Janet Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s in this regard.  If a person\xe2\x80\x99s health and safety are threatened by a domestic abuser, exigent circumstances would justify immediate removal of the abuser from the premises, as happened here.  Cf.

For \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the police cannot prevent a co-tenant from objecting to a search through arrest, surely they cannot arrest a co-tenant and then seek to ignore an objection he has already made.\xe2\x80\x9d  v. , 516 F.\xc2\xa03d 1117, 1124\xe2\x80\x931125 (CA9 2008).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Remarkably, the Court thinks my disagreement with its account of the applicable social norms distances me from \xe2\x80\x99s understanding of social expectations.

Quite the opposite.   considered whether \xe2\x80\x9ccustomary social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection\xe2\x80\x9d; social practice in such circumstances, the Court held, provided no cause to depart from the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98centuries-old principle of respect for privacy of the home.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 115, 121 (quoting  v. ,\n).

Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, by contrast, provides police with ready means to nullify a cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, and therefore \xe2\x80\x9cfails to come to grips with the reasoning of [].\xe2\x80\x9d  at 12, n.\xc2\xa05.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">3</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court that when a sole owner or occupant consents to a search, the police can enter without obtaining a warrant.  See at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Where multiple persons occupy the premises, it is true, this Court has upheld warrantless home searches based on one tenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent; those cases, however, did not involve, as this case does, an occupant who told the police they could not enter.  See  v. ,\n (police relied on cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent to search when other tenant had already been detained in a nearby squad car);  v. ,\n (same, when the other tenant was asleep in the bedroom).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for allowing a search to proceed in those instances\xe2\x80\x94that co-occupants \xe2\x80\x9cassum[e] the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched,\xe2\x80\x9d ,415 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x94does not apply where, as here, an occupant on the premises explicitly tells the police they cannot search his home warrant.

There may be circumstances, the Court observes, in which the police, faced with a cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, will lack probable cause to obtain a warrant.  That same argument was considered and rejected by the Court in , which recognized that \xe2\x80\x9calternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 120.  Moreover, it is unlikely that police, possessing an objective basis to arrest an objecting tenant, will nevertheless lack probable cause to obtain a search warrant.  Probable cause to arrest, I recognize, calls for a showing discrete from the showing needed to establish probable cause to search a home.  But \xe2\x80\x9cwhere, as here, a suspect is arrested at or near his residence, it will often \xe2\x80\x98be permissible to infer that the instrumentalities and fruits of th[e] crime are presently in that person\xe2\x80\x99s residence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as  25 (quoting 2 W.

And as the Court observed in , if a warrant may be impeded by a tenant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to consent, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] co-tenant acting on [her] own initiative may be able to deliver evidence to the police, and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. tell the police what [s]he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 116 (citation omitted).\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Although the validity of Rojas\xe2\x80\x99 consent is not before us, the record offers cause to doubt that her agreement to the search was, in fact, an unpressured exercise of self-determination.
