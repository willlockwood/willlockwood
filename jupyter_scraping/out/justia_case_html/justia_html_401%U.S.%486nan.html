Hazeltine Research, Inc., ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/401/321/case.html">401 U. S. 321</a></span>.  Both \xc2\xa7 303 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 158, as amended, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 187, and \xc2\xa7 4 of the Clayton Act, 38 Stat. 731, as amended, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 15, give a cause of action for injury to business or property.  Whether suits under the two statutes are distinguishable for purposes of determining the time at which a cause of action accrues warrants further exploration by the Court of Appeals.  Further attention should also be given to the question of why a \xc2\xa7 303 cause of action has sufficiently accrued to bring suit as soon as the plaintiff suffers damage, but has not sufficiently accrued to start the running of the statute of limitations on the damages already suffered and for which suit may, be but is not, brought.</p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE and MR. JUSTICE HARLAN would grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and set the case for argument on the merits.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
