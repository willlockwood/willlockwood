Argued December 10, 2003\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 26, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Police officers went to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s home and advised him that they had come to discuss his involvement in drug distribution.  They told him that they had a federal warrant for his arrest and that a grand jury had indicted him for conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine.  During the course of a brief discussion, petitioner made several inculpatory statements.  Once at the county jail, petitioner was advised of his rights under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, and <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/index.html">487 U. S. 285</a>, signed a waiver of those rights, and reiterated his earlier statements.  Before trial, he moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the jail.  A Magistrate Judge recommended that the home statements be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his <em>Miranda</em> rights, and that portions of his jailhouse statements be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  The District Court suppressed the unwarned home statements but admitted the jailhouse statements pursuant to <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, concluding that petitioner had knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights before making the statements.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed the conviction, holding that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s jailhouse statements were properly admitted under <em>Elstad,</em> and that the officers had not violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under <em>Patterson</em> because they did not interrogate him at his home.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Eighth Circuit erred in holding that the absence of an \xe2\x80\x9cinterrogation\xe2\x80\x9d foreclosed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements taken from him at his home.

This Court has consistently applied the deliberate-elicitation standard in subsequent Sixth Amendment cases, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Henry,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/264/index.html">447 U. S. 264</a>, and has expressly distinguished it from the Fifth Amendment custodial-interrogation standard, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Jackson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/index.html">475 U. S. 625</a>.  There is no question here that the officers \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately elicited\xe2\x80\x9d information from petitioner at his home.  Because their discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of his Sixth Amendment rights, the officers\xe2\x80\x99 actions violated the Sixth Amendment standards established in <em>Massiah</em>, <em>supra</em>, and its progeny.

As this Court has not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of <em>Elstad</em> applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the case is remanded to the Eighth Circuit to address this issue in the first instance.

Fellers, police officers arrested him at his home.  During the course of the arrest, petitioner made several inculpatory statements.  He argued that the officers deliberately elicited these statements from him outside the presence of counsel, and that the admission at trial of the fruits of those statements therefore violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Petitioner contends that in rejecting this argument, the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit improperly held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel was \xe2\x80\x9cnot applicable\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 F.\xc2\xa03d 721, 724 (2002).

App. 111.  The officers knocked on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s door and, when petitioner answered, identified themselves and asked if they could come in.  <em>Ibid</em>.

There, the officers advised petitioner for the first time of his rights under <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.

App. 112<em>.</em>  Petitioner and the two officers signed a <em>Miranda</em> waiver form, and petitioner then reiterated the inculpatory statements he had made earlier, admitted to having associated with other individuals implicated in the charged conspiracy, App. 29\xe2\x80\x9339, and admitted to having loaned money to one of them even though he suspected that she was involved in drug transactions, <em>id.,</em> at 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before trial, petitioner moved to suppress the inculpatory statements he made at his home and at the county jail.  A Magistrate Judge conducted a hearing and recommended that the statements petitioner made at his home be suppressed because the officers had not informed petitioner of his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  App. 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  The Magistrate Judge found that petitioner made the statements in response to the officers\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cimplici[t] questions,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that the officers had told petitioner that the purpose of their visit was to discuss his use and distribution of methamphetamine.  <em>Id</em>., at 110.  The Magistrate Judge further recommended that portions of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s jailhouse statement be suppressed as fruits of the prior failure to provide <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  App. 110\xe2\x80\x93111.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court suppressed the \xe2\x80\x9cunwarned\xe2\x80\x9d statements petitioner made at his house but admitted petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s jailhouse statements pursuant to <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U.

App. 112\xe2\x80\x93115.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following a jury trial at which petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s jailhouse statements were admitted into evidence, petitioner was convicted of conspiring to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine.  Petitioner appealed, arguing that his jailhouse statements should have been suppressed as fruits of the statements obtained at his home in violation of the Sixth Amendment.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  285 F.\xc2\xa03d 721 (CA8 2002).  With respect to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 failure to administer <em>Miranda</em> warnings at his home violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel under <em>Patterson</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court of Appeals stated: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Patterson</em> is not applicable here \xe2\x80\xa6 for the officers did not interrogate [petitioner] at his home.\xe2\x80\x9d  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 724.  The Court of Appeals also concluded that the statements from the jail were properly admitted under the rule of <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>.  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 724 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Though <em>Miranda</em> requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 309)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Riley filed a concurring opinion.  He concluded that during their conversation at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s home, officers \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately elicited incriminating information\xe2\x80\x9d from petitioner.  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 726\xe2\x80\x93727.  That \xe2\x80\x9cpost-indictment conduct outside the presence of counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d Judge Riley reasoned, violated petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 727.  Judge Riley nevertheless concurred in the judgment, concluding that the jailhouse statements were admissible under the rationale of <em>Elstad</em> in light of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel.  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 727.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment right to counsel is triggered \xe2\x80\x9cat or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/index.html">430 U.

First, there is no question that the officers in this case \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately elicited\xe2\x80\x9d information from petitioner.  Indeed, the officers, upon arriving at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s house, informed him that their purpose in coming was to discuss his involvement in the distribution of methamphetamine and his association with certain charged co-conspirators.  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 723; App. 112.  Because the ensuing discussion took place after petitioner had been indicted, outside the presence of counsel, and in the absence of any waiver of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights, the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 actions did not violate the Sixth Amendment standards established in <em>Massiah</em>, <em>supra</em>, and its progeny.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, because of its erroneous determination that petitioner was not questioned in violation of Sixth Amendment standards, the Court of Appeals improperly conducted its \xe2\x80\x9cfruits\xe2\x80\x9d analysis under the Fifth Amendment.  Specifically, it applied <em>Elstad,</em> <em>supra</em>, to hold that the admissibility of the jailhouse statements turns solely on whether the statements were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowingly and voluntarily made.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  285 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 724 (quoting <em>Elstad</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 309).  The Court of Appeals did not reach the question whether the Sixth Amendment requires suppression of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s jailhouse statements on the ground that they were the fruits of previous questioning conducted in violation of the Sixth Amendment deliberate-elicitation standard.  We have not had occasion to decide whether the rationale of <em>Elstad</em> applies when a suspect makes incriminating statements after a knowing and voluntary waiver of his right to counsel notwithstanding earlier police questioning in violation of Sixth Amendment standards.  We therefore remand to the Court of Appeals to address this issue in the first instance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left"> It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
