Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 67-751 (Supp.1982).  This appeal presents the question whether the Tennessee bank tax violates the immunity of obligations of the United States from state and local taxation.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellant Memphis Bank &amp; Trust Co. (Memphis Bank) brought this action in state court to recover $56,696.81 in taxes covering the years 1977 and 1978 which had been assessed pursuant to the Tennessee bank tax, Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 67-751 (Supp..1982). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Each bank doing business in Tennessee </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 459 U. S. 394</a></p><p> is required under \xc2\xa7 67-751 to pay to local governments of the State a tax of 3% of the bank\'s net earnings for the preceding fiscal year, less a portion of the <em>ad valorem</em> taxes paid by the bank for that year. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Under the statute, net earnings include interest received by the bank on the obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities, as well as interest on bonds and other obligations of States other than Tennessee, but exclude interest on obligations of Tennessee and its political subdivisions. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant alleged that the bank tax, as applied to it, violated 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742, and thus was unconstitutional under the Supremacy Clause.  The parties stipulated that the amount of tax paid by appellant for the years 1977 and 1978 was based entirely on interest earned on various federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 459 U. S. 395</a></p><p> obligations, primarily notes and bills of the United States Treasury and obligations of Federal Credit Banks. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  They also stipulated that, if the interest earned on such federal obligations were excluded from the computation, Memphis Bank would owe no taxes for the years in question.</p>\n<p>The Chancery Court of Shelby County granted Memphis Bank\'s motion for summary judgment, holding that 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742 prohibits the inclusion of interest on obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities in the computation of taxable "net earnings" under the Tennessee bank tax.  The Supreme Court of Tennessee reversed.  624 S.W.2d 551 (1981).  It held that the bank tax fell within the exception for "nondiscriminatory franchise . . . taxes" set forth in 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742.  We noted probable jurisdiction, 456 U.S. 943 (1982), and we reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Title 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742 establishes a broad exemption of federal obligations from state and local taxation:</p>\n<p>"Except as otherwise provided by law, all stocks, bonds, Treasury notes, and other obligations of the United States, shall be exempt from taxation by or under State or municipal or local authority.  This exemption extends to every form of taxation that would require that either the obligations or the interest thereon, or both, be considered, directly or indirectly, in the computation of the tax, except nondiscriminatory franchise or other nonproperty </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 459 U. S. 396</a></p><p> taxes in lieu thereof imposed on corporations and except estate taxes or inheritance taxes."</p>\n<p>The exemption established in \xc2\xa7 742 applies not only to Treasury notes and bills, but also to the obligations of such instrumentalities of the United States as Federal Farm Credit Banks.  <em>Cf. Smith v. Davis,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/111/case.html">323 U. S. 111</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/323/111/case.html#117">323 U. S. 117</a></span> (1944) ("other obligations" must be interpreted "in accord with the long established Congressional intent to prevent taxes which diminish in the slightest degree the market value or the investment attractiveness of obligations issued by the United States in an effort to secure necessary credit").  Because no federal statutes have "otherwise provided," \xc2\xa7 742 applies to income from the types of federal obligations held by Memphis Bank. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Therefore, the bank tax is impermissible unless the tax is a "nondiscriminatory franchise or other nonproperty ta[x] in lieu thereof" under \xc2\xa7 742. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>We have not previously had occasion to determine whether a state or local tax is "nondiscriminatory" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 742.  However, we have frequently considered this concept in our decisions concerning the constitutional immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 459 U. S. 397</a></p><p> of Federal Government property, including bonds and other securities, from taxation by the States.  Our decisions have treated \xc2\xa7 742 as principally a restatement of the constitutional rule.  <em>See, e.g., New Jersey Realty Title Ins. Co. v. Division of Tax Appeals,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/665/case.html">338 U.

Maryland,</a></span></em> 4 Wheat. 316 (1819),</p>\n<p>"States may not impose taxes directly on the Federal Government, nor may they impose taxes the legal incidence of which falls on the Federal Government."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

Where, as here, the economic but not the legal incidence of the tax falls on the Federal Government, such a tax generally does not violate the constitutional immunity if it does not discriminate against holders of federal property or those with whom the Federal Government deals.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

In calculating net assets, the statute excluded shares owned by the trust company in Pennsylvania corporations, but included shares owned in United States obligations.  The Court found that the tax statute discriminated in favor of securities issued by Pennsylvania corporations and against United States bonds or other obligations.</p>\n<p>Similarly, in <em>Phillips Chemical Co. v. Dumas Independent School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/376/case.html">361 U.

The tax statute applied to lessees of United States Government property, but not to lessees of exempt real property owned by the State and its political subdivisions.  We held that the tax "discriminates unconstitutionally against the United States and its lessee."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/376/case.html#387">361 U. S. 387</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is clear that, under the principles established in our previous cases, the Tennessee bank tax cannot be characterized as nondiscriminatory under \xc2\xa7 742.  Tennessee discriminates in favor of securities issued by Tennessee and its political subdivisions, and against federal obligations.  The State does so by including in the tax base income from federal obligations, while excluding income from otherwise comparable state and local obligations. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We conclude, therefore, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 459 U. S. 399</a></p><p> the Tennessee bank tax impermissibly discriminates against the Federal Government and those with whom it deals.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Tennessee is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Excise tax on bank earnings -- Rate.  -- There is hereby created a subclassification of intangible personal property which shall be designated as the "shares of banks and banking associations."  All property in this subclassification shall be taxed in the following manner:  Commencing in 1977 and each year thereafter, in lieu of the assessment according to the value and taxation of its intangible personal property, each bank doing business in this state shall pay to local governments of Tennessee an excise tax of three percent (3%) of the net earnings for the next preceding fiscal year less ten percent (10%) of the <em>ad valorem</em> taxes paid by the bank on its real property and tangible personal property for the next preceding year.  The net earnings shall be calculated in the same manner as prescribed by chapter 27 of title 67.  The tax herein imposed shall be in lieu of all taxes on the redeemable or cash value of all of their outstanding shares of capital stock, customer savings and checking accounts, certificates of deposit and certificates of investment, by whatever name called, including other intangible corporate property of such bank or banking association provided that such bank or banking association shall nonetheless continue to be subject to <em>ad valorem</em> taxes on its real and tangible personal property, the excise tax imposed under chapter 27 of title 67 and all other taxes to which it is currently subject.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>A "minimum tax" provides, that under \xc2\xa7 67-751, the bank shall be taxed no less than an <em>ad valorem</em> tax calculated on 60% of the bank\'s book value.  Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 67-752 (Supp.1982).  The parties apparently did not consider the "minimum tax" described in \xc2\xa7 67-752 to be an alternative basis of tax liability in the event that  67-751 was held unconstitutional.  Accordingly, the courts below had no occasion to consider the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 67-752, and we do not reach this question.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>For purposes of the bank tax, the term "net earnings" is defined as "[f]ederal taxable income" with specified adjustments.  Tenn.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 67-2704 (Supp.1982).  "Federal taxable income" includes interest on obligations of the United States and its instrumentalities, but does not include interest on state or municipal obligations.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 103(a).  Tennessee Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 67-2704(b)(1)(B) adjusts "federal taxable income" by adding "[i]nterest income earned on bonds and other obligations of other states or their political subdivisions, less allowable amortization."  However, no similar adjustment is made to include interest on obligations of the State of Tennessee or its political subdivisions in the definition of "net earnings" subject to the bank tax.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>There are 37 Farm Credit Banks:  12 Federal Land Banks, 12 Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and 13 Banks for Cooperatives.

We have no occasion to determine whether the immunity described in these provisions is broader than that otherwise provided by 31 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 742.  We note, however, that, for purposes of federal tax immunity, our cases have made no distinction between the obligations of the United States Treasury and the obligations of the Federal Credit Banks.  <em>See, e.g., Tradesmens National Bank of Oklahoma v.
