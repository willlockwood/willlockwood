The Ohio Supreme Court, in an unreported order, <em>sua sponte,</em> dismissed appellant\'s appeal to that court "for the reason that no substantial constitutional question exists herein."  We granted leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> and reverse.</p>\n<p>On December 11, 1972, we held that <em>Gooding v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html">405 U. S. 518</a></span> (1972), required the reversal of a previous action of the Ohio Supreme Court that dismissed an appeal from a conviction under \xc2\xa7 2327.03.  <em>Cason v. City of Columbus,</em> 409 U.S. 1053.

In that circumstance, the Ohio Supreme Court erred when it found no constitutional infirmity in the holding of the Court of Appeals of Franklin County that the ordinance might constitutionally reach appellant\'s conduct because</p>\n<p>"the words as used by the [appellant] are in the nature of \'fighting words,\' and thereby fall within that limit of conduct proscribed by the ordinance. . . ."</p>\n<p>For</p>\n<p>"\'[a]lthough [the ordinance] may be neither vague, overbroad, nor otherwise invalid as applied to the conduct charged against a particular defendant, he is permitted to raise its vagueness or unconstitutional overbreadth as applied to others.  And if the law is found deficient in one of these respects, it may not be applied to him either, until and unless a satisfactory limiting construction is placed on the [ordinance].  The [ordinance], in effect, is stricken down on its face. . . .\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html#521">405 U.

Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html">405 U. S. 518</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/518/case.html#534">405 U. S. 534</a></span> (1972), and in the dissenting statement in <em>Cason v. City of Columbus,</em> 409 U.S. 1053 (1972).</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL, with whom MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST concurs, dissenting.</p>\n<p>Appellant is a Columbus cab driver.  He had a female fare in his cab who had requested to be taken to a certain address.  When he passed this address, the fare complained and -- according to the statement of the trial court -- the cab driver\'s response was "a series of absolutely </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 414 U. S. 4</a></p><p> vulgar, suggestive and abhorrent sexually oriented statements."</p>\n<p>I would sustain appellant\'s conviction for the reasons stated in my dissenting opinion in <em>Rosenfeld v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/901/case.html">408 U. S. 901</a></span>, 906 (1972).  As stated therein:</p>\n<p>"[A] verbal assault on an unwilling audience [or an individual] may be so grossly offensive and emotionally disturbing as to be the proper subject of criminal proscription, whether under a statute denominating it disorderly conduct, or, more accurately, a public nuisance."</p>\n<p>The Columbus City Code was certainly sufficiently explicit to inform appellant that his verbal assault on a female passenger in his cab was "menacing and insulting."  As a wrong of this character does not fall within the protection of the First Amendment, the overbreadth doctrine is not applicable.  <em>See</em> Model Penal Code, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 250.2(1)(a) and (b) (Proposed Official Draft 1962); <em>see also Williams v. District of Columbia,</em> 136 U.S.App.D.C. 56, 64, 419 F.2d 638, 646 (1969).</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
