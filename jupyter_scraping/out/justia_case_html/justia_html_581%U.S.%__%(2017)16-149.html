When Nevils was injured in an automobile accident, Coventry paid his medical expenses.  Coventry subsequently asserted a lien against part of the settlement Nevils recovered from the driver who caused his injuries.  Nevils satisfied the lien, then filed a class action in Missouri state court, alleging that, under Missouri law, which does not permit subrogation or reimbursement in this context, Coventry had unlawfully obtained reimbursement.  Coventry countered that \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) preempted the state law.  The trial court granted summary judgment in Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s favor, and the Missouri Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Missouri Supreme Court reversed.  Finding \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) susceptible to diverse plausible readings, the court invoked a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption against preemption\xe2\x80\x9d to conclude that the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope excluded subrogation and reimbursement.  On remand from this Court for further consideration in light of OPM\xe2\x80\x99s 2015 rule, the Missouri Supreme Court adhered to its earlier decision.

But the Court never chose between the two readings set out in <i>McVeigh</i>, because doing so was not pertinent to the discrete question whether federal courts have subject-matter jurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions.  Having decided in <i>McVeigh</i> that \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) is a \xe2\x80\x9cchoice-of-law prescription,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction-conferring provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 697, the Court had no cause to consider \xc2\xa78902(m)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and purpose, as it does here.

Many other federal statutes found to preempt state law, including the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Federal Arbitration Act, leave the context-specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.

FEHBA contains a provision expressly preempting state law.  \xc2\xa78902(m)(1).  That provision reads:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Contracts OPM negotiates with private carriers provide for reimbursement and subrogation.  Reimbursement requires an insured employee who receives payment from another source (<i>e.g.</i>, the proceeds yielded by a tort claim) to return healthcare costs earlier paid out by the carrier.  Subrogation involves transfer of the right to a third-party payment from the insured employee to the carrier, who can then pursue the claim against the third party.  Several States, however, Missouri among them, bar enforcement of contractual subrogation and reimbursement provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The questions here presented: Does FEHBA\xe2\x80\x99s express-preemption prescription, \xc2\xa78902(m)(1), override state law prohibiting subrogation and reimbursement; and if \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) has that effect, is the statutory prescription consistent with the Supremacy Clause, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2?  We hold, contrary to the decision of the Missouri Supreme Court, that contractual subrogation and reimbursement prescriptions plainly \xe2\x80\x9crelate to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. payments with respect to benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78902(m)(1); therefore, by statutory instruction, they override state law barring subrogation and reimbursement.  We further hold, again contrary to the Missouri Supreme Court, that the regime Congress enacted is compatible with the Supremacy Clause.  Section 8902(m)(1) itself, not the contracts OPM negotiates, triggers the federal preemption.  As Congress directed, where FEHBA contract terms \xe2\x80\x9crelate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) ensures that those terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, free from state interference.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">FEHBA \xe2\x80\x9cestablishes a comprehensive program of health insurance for federal employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc.</i> v. <i>McVeigh</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677,\n682 (2006)\n.  As just noted, <i>supra</i>, at 1, FEHBA contains an express-preemption provision, \xc2\xa78902(m)(1).  FEHBA assigns to OPM broad administrative and rulemaking authority over the program.

We have \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly recognized\xe2\x80\x9d that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crelate to\xe2\x80\x9d in a preemption clause \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[es] a broad pre-emptive purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morales</i> v. <i>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</i>,\n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374,\n383 (1992)\n; accord <i>Northwest, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ginsberg</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 5, 9).  Congress characteristically employs the phrase to reach any subject that has \xe2\x80\x9ca connection with, or reference to,\xe2\x80\x9d the topics the statute enumerates.  <i>Morales</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384.  The phrase therefore weighs against Nevils\xe2\x80\x99 effort to narrow the term \xe2\x80\x9cpayments\xe2\x80\x9d to exclude payments that occur \xe2\x80\x9clong after\xe2\x80\x9d a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s provision of benefits (Brief for Respondent 27 (quoting <i>McVeigh</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 697)).  See <i>Nevils I</i>, 418 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 460 (Wilson, J., concurring); cf. <i>Hillman</i> v. <i>Maretta</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 10) (in the Federal Employees\xe2\x80\x99 Group Life Insurance Act context, it \xe2\x80\x9cmakes no difference\xe2\x80\x9d whether state law withholds benefits in the first instance or instead takes them away after they have been paid).  Given language notably \xe2\x80\x9cexpansive [in] sweep,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Morales</i>, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 384 (internal quotation marks omitted), Nevils\xe2\x80\x99 argument that Congress intended to preempt only state coverage requirements (<i>e.g.</i>, for acupuncture and chiropractic services, see Brief for Respondent 36) also miscarries.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory context and purpose reinforce our conclusion.  FEHBA concerns \xe2\x80\x9cbenefits from a federal health insurance plan for federal employees that arise from a federal law\xe2\x80\x9d in an area with a \xe2\x80\x9clong history of federal involvement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bell</i>, 823 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1202.  Strong and \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctly federal interests are involved,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>McVeigh</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 696, in uniform administration of the program, free from state interference, particularly in regard to coverage, benefits, and payments.  The Federal Government, more-over, has a significant financial stake.  OPM estimates that, in 2014 alone, FEHBA \xe2\x80\x9ccarriers were reimbursed by approximately $126 million in subrogation recoveries.\xe2\x80\x9d  80 Fed. Reg. 29203.  Such \xe2\x80\x9crecoveries translate to premium cost savings for the federal government and [FEHBA] enrollees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Invoking our suggestion in <i>McVeigh</i> that \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) has two \xe2\x80\x9cplausible\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 698, Nevils nonetheless urges us to apply a presumption against preemption because \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) does not clearly cover contractual terms pertaining to subrogation and reimbursement.  This argument is blind to <i>McVeigh</i>\xe2\x80\x99s context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>McVeigh</i>, we considered the discrete question whether\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71331 gives federal courts subject-matter jurisdiction over FEHBA reimbursement actions.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 683.  Our principal holding was that \xc2\xa71331 did not confer federal jurisdiction.  <i>Ibid.</i>; see <i>Bell</i>, 823 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1205.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The carrier in <i>McVeigh</i>, as part of its argument in favor of federal jurisdiction, asserted that \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) itself conferred federal jurisdiction.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 697.  In responding to that assertion, we summarized competing interpretations of \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) advanced in briefing, readings that map closely onto the parties\xe2\x80\x99 positions here.  See <i>ibid.</i> (carrier and United States as <i>amicus curiae</i> urged interpretation similar to Coventry\xe2\x80\x99s; an <i>amicus</i> brief in support of beneficiary offered interpretation similar to Nevils\xe2\x80\x99).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We made no choice between the two interpretationsset out in <i>McVeigh</i>, however, because the answer madeno difference to the question there presented.  <i>Id.,</i> at698.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven if FEHBA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision reaches contract-based reimbursement claims,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthat provision is not sufficiently broad to confer federal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Because \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) is a \xe2\x80\x9cchoice-of-law prescription,\xe2\x80\x9d not a \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction-conferring provision,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 697, we had no cause to consider \xc2\xa78902(m)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and purpose, as we do today, see <i>supra</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nevils further contends that, if \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) covers subrogation and reimbursement clauses in OPM contracts, then the statute itself would violate the Supremacy Clause by assigning preemptive effect to the terms of a contract, not to the laws of the United States.  We conclude, however, that the statute, not a contract, strips state law of its force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Without \xc2\xa78902(m)(1), there would be no preemption of state insurance law.  FEHBA contract terms have preemptive force only as they \xe2\x80\x9crelate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits),\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa78902(m)(1)\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.</i>, when the contract terms fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive scope.  It is therefore the statute that \xe2\x80\x9censures that [FEHBA contract] terms will be uniformly enforceable nationwide, notwithstanding any state law relating to health insurance or plans.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 28 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Many other federal statutes preempt state law in this way, leaving the context-specific scope of preemption to contractual terms.  The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA),\n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, for example, preempts \xe2\x80\x9cany and all State laws insofar as they\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. relate to any employee benefit plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71144(a).  And the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA),\n\n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <i>et\xc2\xa0seq.</i>, limits the grounds for denying enforcement of \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision[s] in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. contract[s]\xe2\x80\x9d providing for arbitration, thereby preempting state laws that would otherwise interfere with such contracts.  \xc2\xa72.  This Court has several times held that those statutes preempt state law, see, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Gobeille</i> v. <i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co.</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2016) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x9312) (ERISA); <i>Marmet Health Care Center, Inc.</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530\n\xe2\x80\x93534 (2012) (<i>per curiam</i>) (FAA), and Nevils does not contend that those measures violate the Supremacy Clause, see Brief for Respondent 22.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nevils instead attempts to distinguish those other statutes by highlighting a particular textual feature of \xc2\xa78902(m)(1): Section 8902(m)(1) states that the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>terms of any contract</i>\xe2\x80\x9d between OPM and a carrier \xe2\x80\x9cshall supersede and preempt\xe2\x80\x9d certain state or local laws.  (Emphasis added.)  That formulation, Nevils asserts, violates the Supremacy Clause\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that only the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Laws</i> of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d may reign supreme over state law.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. VI, cl.\xc2\xa02 (emphasis added).  Nevils\xe2\x80\x99 argument elevates semantics over substance.  While Congress\xe2\x80\x99 formulation might differ from the phrasing of other statutes, \xc2\xa78902(m)(1) manifests the same intent to preempt state law.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Because we do not require Congress to employ a particular linguistic formulation when preempting state law, Nevils\xe2\x80\x99 Supremacy Clause challenge fails.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For the reasons stated, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Missouri is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Justice Gorsuch took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Coventry was formerly known as Group Health Plan, Inc.
