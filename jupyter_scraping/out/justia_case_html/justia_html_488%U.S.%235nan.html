This case raises the question of what limitations period should apply to a \xc2\xa7 1983 action where a State has one or more statutes of limitations for certain enumerated intentional torts, and a residual statute for all other personal injury actions.

S. 237</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>On November 13, 1985, respondent Tom U. U. Okure brought suit in the District Court for the Northern District of New York, seeking damages under \xc2\xa7 1983 from petitioners Javan Owens and Daniel G. Lessard, two State University of New York (SUNY) police officers.  Okure alleged that, on January 27, 1984, the officers unlawfully arrested him on the SUNY campus in Albany and charged him with disorderly conduct.  The complaint stated that Okure was "forcibly transported" to a police detention center, "battered and beaten by [the police officers] and forced to endure great emotional distress, physical harm, and embarrassment."  App. 5-6.  As a result of the arrest and beating, Okure claimed, he</p>\n<p>"sustained personal injuries, including broken teeth and a sprained finger, mental anguish, shame, humiliation, legal expenses and the deprivation of his constitutional rights."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 6.</p>\n<p>The officers moved to dismiss the complaint, which had been filed 22 months after the alleged incident, as time-barred.  They contended that \xc2\xa7 1983 actions were governed by New York\'s 1-year statute of limitations covering eight intentional torts:</p>\n<p>"assault, battery, false imprisonment, malicious prosecution, libel, slander, false words causing special damages, [and] a violation of the right of privacy."</p>\n<p>N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 215(3) (McKinney 1972).</p>\n<p>The District Court denied the motion to dismiss.  625 F.Supp. 1568 (NDNY 1986).  Borrowing "a narrowly drawn statute which is applicable only to certain intentional torts," <em>id.</em> at 1570, the court stated, was inconsistent with this Court\'s endorsement of "a simple, broad characterization of all \xc2\xa7 1983 claims."  <em>Ibid.</em> (citing <em>Wilson, supra,</em> at 272).  Moreover, a 1-year statute of limitations on \xc2\xa7 1983 claims "would improperly restrict the scope of \xc2\xa7 1983 and controvert federal policy."  625 F.Supp. at 1571.  The court concluded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 488 U. S. 238</a></p><p> that New York\'s 3-year residual statute of limitations for claims of personal injury not embraced by specific statutes of limitations, N.Y.Civ.Prac.Law \xc2\xa7 214(5) (McKinney Supp.1988), [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] was applicable to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions, and that Okure\'s complaint was therefore timely.  The court then certified an interlocutory appeal on this question pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1292(b) (1982 ed., Supp. IV) and Rule 5(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit granted permission for the appeal, and affirmed.  816 F.2d 45 (1987).  It stated that <em>Wilson\'s</em> description of \xc2\xa7 1983 claims as general personal injury actions required a statute of limitations "expansive enough to accommodate the diverse personal injury torts that section 1983 has come to embrace."  <em>Id.</em> at 48.  As between the two New York statutes of limitations, the court observed:</p>\n<p>"By nature, section 214(5) is general; section 215(3) is more specific and exceptional.  This dichotomy survives no matter how many similar intentional torts are judicially added to those enumerated in section 215(3)."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> The Court of Appeals favored \xc2\xa7 214(5) for another reason:  its 3-year period of limitations</p>\n<p>"more faithfully represents the federal interest in providing an effective remedy for violations of civil rights than does the restrictive one-year limit."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 49.  Injuries to personal rights are not "necessarily apparent to the victim at the time they are inflicted," the court explained, and "[e]ven where the injury itself is obvious, the constitutional dimensions of the tort may not be."  <em>Id.</em> at 48.</p>\n<p>The dissent argued that \xc2\xa7 1983 actions are best analogized to intentional torts, <em>id.</em> at 51, and that, because \xc2\xa7 215(3) governs "almost every intentional injury to the person," <em>id.</em> at </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 488 U. S. 239</a></p><p> 50, it is more appropriate for \xc2\xa7 1983 claims than \xc2\xa7 214(5), which it contended had been confined primarily to negligence claims.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The dissent added that using \xc2\xa7 215(3)\'s 1-year limitations period is not "inherently inconsistent with the policies underlying the Civil Rights Act."  <em>Id.</em> at 54.  We granted certiorari, 485 U.S. 958 (1988), and now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In this case, we again confront the consequences of Congress\' failure to provide a specific statute of limitations to govern \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  Title 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 endorses the borrowing of state law limitations provisions where doing so is consistent with federal law; \xc2\xa7 1988 does not, however, offer any guidance as to which state provision to borrow. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  To fill this void, for years we urged courts to select the state statute of limitations "most analogous," <em>Board of Regents, Univ. of New York v.

S. 240</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The practice of seeking state law analogies for particular \xc2\xa7 1983 claims bred confusion and inconsistency in the lower courts and generated time-consuming litigation.  Some courts found analogies in common law tort, others in contract law, and still others in statutory law. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Often the result had less to do with the general nature of \xc2\xa7 1983 relief than with counsel\'s artful pleading and ability to persuade the court that the facts and legal theories of a particular \xc2\xa7 1983 claim resembled a particular common law or statutory cause of action.  Consequently, plaintiffs and defendants often had no idea whether a federal civil rights claim was barred until a court ruled on their case.  Predictability, a primary goal of statutes of limitations, was thereby frustrated.</p>\n<p>In <em>Wilson,</em> we sought to end this "conflict, confusion and uncertainty."  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#266">471 U. S. 266</a></span>.  Recognizing the problems inherent in the case-by-case approach, we determined that 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1988 requires courts to borrow and apply to all \xc2\xa7 1983 claims the one most analogous state statute of limitations.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#275">471 U.

S. 272</a></span> ("[A] simple, broad characterization of all \xc2\xa7 1983 claims best fits the statute\'s remedial purpose").  We concluded, based upon the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 1983 and the wide array of claims now embraced by that provision, that \xc2\xa7 1983 "confer[s] a general remedy for injuries to personal rights."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#278">471 U. S. 278</a></span>.  Because "\xc2\xa7 1983 claims are best characterized as personal injury actions," we held that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 488 U.

S. 280</a></span>.</p>\n<p>As the instant case indicates, <em>Wilson</em> has not completely eliminated the confusion over the appropriate limitations period for \xc2\xa7 1983 claims.  In States where one statute of limitations applies to all personal injury claims, <em>Wilson</em> supplies a clear answer.  Courts considering \xc2\xa7 1983 claims in States with multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions, however, have differed over how to determine which statute applies. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Several Courts of Appeals have held that the appropriate period is that which the State assigns to certain enumerated intentional torts.  These courts have reasoned that intentional torts are most closely analogous to the claims Congress envisioned being brought under the Civil Rights Act, and to the paradigmatic claims brought today under \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Other Courts of Appeals, by contrast, have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 488 U. S. 242</a></p><p> endorsed the use of the state residuary statute of limitations for \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  These courts have observed that \xc2\xa7 1983 embraces a broad array of actions for injury to personal rights, and that the intentional tort is therefore too narrow an analogy to a \xc2\xa7 1983 claim. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit followed this second approach when it concluded that New York\'s statute of limitations for certain enumerated intentional torts did not reflect the diversity of \xc2\xa7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In choosing between the two alternatives endorsed by the Courts of Appeals -- the intentional torts approach and the general or residual personal injury approach -- we are mindful that ours is essentially a practical inquiry.  <em>Wilson,</em> 471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#272">471 U. S. 272</a></span>.  Our decision in <em>Wilson</em> that one "simple broad characterization" of all \xc2\xa7 1983 actions was appropriate under \xc2\xa7 1988 was, after all, grounded in the realization that the potential </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 488 U. S. 243</a></p><p> applicability of different state statutes of limitations had bred chaos and uncertainty.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#275">471 U. S. 275</a></span>; <em>see also Burnett v. Grattan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/42/case.html">468 U. S. 42</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/42/case.html#50">468 U. S. 50</a></span> (1984) (courts selecting a state statute of limitations for \xc2\xa7 1983 actions must "tak[e] into account practicalities that are involved in litigating federal civil rights claims"); <em>accord, Felder v. Casey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/131/case.html">487 U. S. 131</a></span> (1988).  Thus, our task today is to provide courts with a rule for determining the appropriate personal injury limitations statute that can be applied with ease and predictability in all 50 States.</p>\n<p>A rule endorsing the choice of the state statute of limitations for intentional torts would be manifestly inappropriate.  Every State has multiple intentional tort limitations provisions, carving up the universe of intentional torts into different configurations.  In New York, for example, \xc2\xa7 215(3), the intentional tort statute endorsed by petitioners, covers eight enumerated torts.  <em>See supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/488/235/case.html#237">488 U. S. 237</a></span>.  But different provisions cover other specified intentional torts.  Malpractice actions are governed by one provision; certain veterans\' claims, by another. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In Michigan, separate statutes of limitations govern "assault, battery, or false imprisonment," Mich.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 600.5805(2) (1979), "malicious prosecution," </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 488 U. S. 244</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 600.5805(3), "libel or slander," \xc2\xa7 600.5805(7), and "all other actions to recover damages for the death of a person or for injury to a person. . . ," \xc2\xa7 600.5805(8).  In Ohio, separate provisions govern "bodily injury," Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 2305.10 (Supp.1987), "libel, slander, malicious prosecution, or false imprisonment," \xc2\xa7 2305.11, and "assault or battery," \xc2\xa7 2305.111.  Similarly, in Pennsylvania, separate provisions govern "libel, slander or invasion of privacy," 42 Pa.Cons.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5523(1) (1988), "assault, battery, false imprisonment, false arrest, malicious prosecution or malicious abuse of process," \xc2\xa7 5524(1), "injuries to the person or for the death of an individual caused by the wrongful act or neglect or unlawful violence or negligence of another," \xc2\xa7 5524(2), and</p>\n<p>"[a]ny other action or proceeding to recover damages for injury to person or property which is founded on negligent, intentional, or otherwise tortious conduct."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 5524(7).  Were we to call upon courts to apply the state statute of limitations governing intentional torts, we would succeed only in transferring the present confusion over the choice among multiple personal injury provisions to a choice among multiple intentional tort provisions. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 488 U. S. 245</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In marked contrast to the multiplicity of state intentional tort statutes of limitations, every State has one general or residual statute of limitations governing personal injury actions.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 488 U. S. 246</a></p><p> Some States have a general provision which applies to all personal injury actions with certain specific exceptions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Others have a residual provision which applies to all </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 488 U. S. 247</a></p><p> actions not specifically provided for, including personal injury actions. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Whichever form they take, these provisions are easily identifiable by language or application.  Indeed, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 488 U. S. 248</a></p><p> very idea of a general or residual statute suggests that each State would have no more than one.  Potential \xc2\xa7 1983 plaintiffs and defendants therefore can readily ascertain, with little risk of confusion or unpredictability, the applicable limitations period in advance of filing a \xc2\xa7 1983 action.</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' argument that courts should borrow the intentional tort limitations periods because intentional torts are most analogous to \xc2\xa7 1983 claims fails to recognize the enormous practical disadvantages of such a selection.

In <em>Wilson,</em> we noted that claims brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 include:</p>\n<p>"discrimination in public employment on the basis of race or the exercise of First Amendment rights, discharge or demotion without procedural due process, mistreatment of schoolchildren, deliberate indifference to the medical needs of prison inmates, the seizure of chattels without advance notice or sufficient opportunity to be heard."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#273">471 U.

Many of these claims bear little if any resemblance to the common law intentional tort.  <em>See Felder v.

Even where intent is an element of a constitutional claim or defense, the necessary intent is often different from the intent requirement of a related common law tort.  <em>E.g., Hustler Magazine v. Falwell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/46/case.html">485 U. S. 46</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/485/46/case.html#53">485 U.

Given that so many claims brought under \xc2\xa7 1983 have no precise state law analog, applying the statute of limitations for the limited category of intentional torts would be inconsistent with \xc2\xa7 1983\'s broad scope.

Although these violent acts often resembled the torts of assault, battery, false imprisonment, and misrepresentation, \xc2\xa7 1983 was not directed at the perpetrators of these deeds as much as at the state officials who tolerated and condoned them.</p>\n<p>"While one main scourge of the evil -- perhaps the leading one -- was the Ku Klux Klan, the remedy created [\xc2\xa7 1983] was not a remedy against it or its members, but against those who representing a State in some capacity were <em>unable</em> or <em>unwilling</em> to enforce a state law."</p>\n<p><em>Monroe v.

S. 634</a></span> (1981) ("Nothing in the language of \xc2\xa71983 or its legislative history limits the statute solely to intentional deprivations of constitutional rights").</p>\n<p>The intentional tort analogy also inadequately reflects the state of tort law at the time the Civil Rights Act was enacted.  Almost all States had two types of personal injury claims:  trespass and trespass or action on the case.  J. K. Angell, Limitations of Actions at Law 13-14, 311-319 (1869); H. F. Buswell, Statute of Limitations and Adverse Possession 307-308 (1889).  Trespass claims covered direct injury and action on the case indirect injury.  W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton, Law of Torts 29-30 (6th ed.1984).  The paradigmatic \xc2\xa7 1983 claim in 1871 involved a victim of violence or harassment who sued state officials for failing to prevent the harm; involving indirect injury, it would have been covered by the action on the case doctrine, including the relevant statute of limitations.  Because most States have replaced action on the case with the general personal injury or residual provisions, and trespass with specialized intentional tort provisions, history supports the application of the former to \xc2\xa7 1983 claims.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Our decision today is fully consistent with <em>Wilson\'s</em> rejection of a state residual, or "catchall," limitations provision as the appropriate one for \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  471 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/261/case.html#278">471 U. S. 278</a></span>.  In <em>Wilson,</em> we rejected recourse to such provisions in the first instance, a position we continue to embrace.  Courts should resort to residual statutes of limitations only where state law provides multiple statutes of limitations for personal injury actions and the residual one embraces, either explicitly or by judicial construction, unspecified personal injury actions.  <em>See, e.g., Small v. Inhabitants of Belfast,</em> 796 F.2d 644 (CA1 1986) (construing Maine\'s catch-all statute as the general personal injury provision); <em>Alley v. Dodge Hotel,</em> 163 U.S.App.D.C. 320, 601 F.2d 880 (1974) (per curiam) (construing District of Columbia\'s catch-all statute as the general personal injury provision).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>Because we hold that the Court of Appeals correctly borrowed New York\'s 3-year general personal injury statute of limitations, we need not address Okure\'s argument that applying a 1-year limitations period to \xc2\xa7 1983 actions would be inconsistent with federal interests.  <em>See Burnett v.
