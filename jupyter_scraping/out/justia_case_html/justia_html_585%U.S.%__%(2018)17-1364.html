The case concerns the redistricting of state legislative districts by the North Carolina General Assembly in 2011, in response to the 2010 census.  A group of plaintiff voters, appellees here, alleged that the General Assembly racially gerrymandered their districts when\xe2\x80\x94in an ostensible effort to comply with the requirements of the Voting Rights Act of 1965\xe2\x80\x94it drew 28 State Senate and State House of Representatives districts comprising majorities of black voters.  The District Court granted judgment to the plaintiffs, and we summarily affirmed that judgment.  See <i>Covington </i>v. <i>North Carolina</i>, 316 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 117 (MDNC 2016), summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, however, we vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial order, which directed the General Assembly to adopt new districting maps, shortened by one year the terms of the legislators currently serving in the gerrymandered districts, called for special elections in those districts, and suspended two provisions of the North Carolina Constitution.  See <i>North Carolina </i>v. <i>Covington</i>, 581 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2017) (<i>per curiam</i>) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932).  The District Court ordered all of this, we noted, after undertaking only the \xe2\x80\x9cmost cursory\xe2\x80\x9d review of the equitable balance involved in court-ordered special elections.  <i>Id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Having found that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98was barely exercised,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d we remanded the case for further remedial proceedings.  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Winter</i> v. <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i>,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 7, 27 (2008)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On remand, the District Court ordered the General Assembly to draw remedial maps for the State House and State Senate within a month, and to file those maps in the District Court for approval.  The General Assembly complied after directing its map drawers to, among other things, make \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonable efforts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to avoid pairing incumbent members of the House [and] Senate\xe2\x80\x9d and not to use \xe2\x80\x9c[d]ata identifying the race of individuals or voters\xe2\x80\x9d in the drawing of the new districts.  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 410, 417\xe2\x80\x93418 (MDNC 2018) (<i>per curiam</i>).  The plaintiffs filed objections to the new maps.  They argued that four legislative districts\xe2\x80\x94Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57\xe2\x80\x94still segregated voters on the basis of race.  The plaintiffs also objected to the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s decision to redraw five State House districts situated in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties.  They argued that those five districts \xe2\x80\x9cdid not violate the [U.\xc2\xa0S.] Constitution, [and] did not abut a district violating the [U.\xc2\xa0S.] Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 443.  Thus, they contended, the revision of the borders of those districts constituted mid-decade redistricting in violation of the North Carolina Constitution.  See Art. II, \xc2\xa75(4); <i>Granville County Commr\xe2\x80\x99s </i>v. <i>Ballard</i>, 69 N.\xc2\xa0C. 18, 20\xe2\x80\x9321 (1873).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After some consideration of these objections, the District Court appointed a Special Master to redraw the lines of the districts to which the plaintiffs objected, along with any nonadjacent districts to the extent \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to comply with districting criteria specified by the District Court.  App. to Juris. Statement 106\xe2\x80\x93107.  Those criteria included adherence to the \xe2\x80\x9ccounty groupings\xe2\x80\x9d used by the legislature in its remedial plan and to North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cWhole County Provision as interpreted by the North Carolina Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 108.  The District Court further instructed the Special Master to make \xe2\x80\x9creasonable efforts to adhere to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. state policy objectives\xe2\x80\x9d by creating relatively compact districts and by avoiding split municipalities and precincts.  <i>Id.,</i> at 108\xe2\x80\x93109.  The District Court also permitted the Special Master to \xe2\x80\x9cadjust district lines to avoid pairing any incumbents who have not publicly announced their intention not to run in 2018\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider data identifying the race of individuals or voters to the extent necessary to ensure that his plan cures the unconstitutional racial gerrymanders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 109\xe2\x80\x93111.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Upon receipt of the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s report, the District Court sustained the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 objections and adopted the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommended reconfiguration of the state legislative maps.  See 283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 414.  With respect to Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57, the District Court found that those districts, as redrawn by the legislature, \xe2\x80\x9cretain[ed] the core shape\xe2\x80\x9d of districts that it had earlier found to be unconstitutional.  <i>Id.,</i> at 436; see <i>id.,</i> at<i> </i>439, 440, 441\xe2\x80\x93442.  The District Court noted, for instance, that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s remedial plan for Senate District 21 copied the prior plan\xe2\x80\x99s  \xe2\x80\x9chorseshoe-shaped section of the city of Fayetteville,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cinclude[d] Fayetteville\xe2\x80\x99s predominantly black [voting districts] and blocks and exclude[d] Fayetteville\xe2\x80\x99s predominantly white [voting districts] and blocks.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 436.  Although the defendants explained that the new district was designed to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preserve the heart of Fayetteville,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court found that they had \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ed] to provide any explanation or evidence as to why \xe2\x80\x98preserving the heart of Fayetteville\xe2\x80\x99 required the exclusion of numerous majority-white precincts in downtown Fayetteville from the remedial district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(alterations omitted).  Likewise, the District Court found that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s remedial version of Senate District 28, though it \xe2\x80\x9cencompasse[d] only a portion of [the city of] Greensboro,\xe2\x80\x9d nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9cencompasse[d] <i>all </i>of the majority black [voting districts] within Greensboro,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cexclud[ing] predominantly white sections of Greensboro,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creach[ing] out of Greensboro\xe2\x80\x99s city limits to capture predominantly  African-American areas in eastern Guilford County.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 438.  By choosing to preserve the shape of the district\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98anchor\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in eastern Greensboro, the District Court found, the General Assembly had \xe2\x80\x9censured that the district would retain a high [black voting age population], thereby perpetuating the effects of the racial gerrymander.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 438\xe2\x80\x93439.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court made similar findings with respect to the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s remedial House Districts 21 and 57.  House District 21, it found, \xe2\x80\x9c(1) preserve[d] the core shape of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the previously unconstitutional district, (2) include[d] all but one of the majority-black [voting districts] in the two counties through which it [ran], (3) divide[d] a municipality and precinct along racial lines, [and] (4) ha[d] an irregular shape that corresponde[d] to the racial make-up of the geographic area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 439\xe2\x80\x93440.  In light of this and other evidence, the District Court concluded that House District 21 \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue[d] to be a racial gerrymander.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at<i> </i>440.  House District 57, the District Court found, likewise inexplicably \xe2\x80\x9cdivide[d] the city of Greensboro along racial lines,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 442, and otherwise preserved features of the previously invalidated 2011 maps.  The District Court thus concluded that the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x99s remedial plans as to those districts were unconstitutional.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court then sustained the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 remaining objection that several House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties had been redrawn unnecessarily in violation of the North Carolina Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on mid-decade redistricting.  See <i>id.,</i> at 443 (citing Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa75(4)).  The court reasoned that the prohibition \xe2\x80\x9cpreclude[d] the General Assembly from engaging in mid-decade redistricting\xe2\x80\x9d except to the extent \xe2\x80\x9crequired by federal law or a judicial order.\xe2\x80\x9d  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 443.  It noted further that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a court must draw remedial districts itself, this means that a court may redraw only those districts necessary to remedy the constitutional violation,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i> (citing <i>Upham</i> v. <i>Seamon</i>,\n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 37, 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (1982) (<i>per curiam</i>)), and that \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Upham</i> requires that a federal district court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial order not unnecessarily interfere with state redistricting choices,\xe2\x80\x9d 283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 443.  This remedial principle informed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe General Assembly [had] exceeded its authority under [the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial] order by disregarding the mid-decade redistricting prohibition,\xe2\x80\x9d since the legislature had failed to \xe2\x80\x9cput forward any evidence showing that revising <i>any</i> of the five Wake and Mecklenburg County House districts challenged by Plaintiffs was necessary to remedy the racially gerrymandered districts in those two counties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 444.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the District Court adopted the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommended replacement plans for the districts to which the plaintiffs had objected.  In adopting those recommendations, the District Court turned away the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they were built on \xe2\x80\x9cspecific .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. quota[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of black voters in each reconstituted district.  <i>Id.,</i> at 448\xe2\x80\x93449.  The District Court instead credited the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s submission that his \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98remedial districts were drawn not with any racial target in mind, but in order to maximize compactness, preserve precinct boundaries, and respect political subdivision lines,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that the remedial map was the product of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98explicitly race-neutral criteria.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 449.  The District Court directed the defendants to implement the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommended district lines and to conduct elections accordingly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The defendants applied to this Court for a stay of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order pending appeal.  We granted a stay with respect to implementation of the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s remedial districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties, but otherwise denied the application.  See 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018).  The defendants timely appealed directly to this Court as provided under\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71253.  We have jurisdiction, and now summarily affirm in part and reverse in part the order of the District Court.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The defendants first argue that the District Court lacked jurisdiction even to enter a remedial order in this case.  In their view, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here, as here, a lawsuit challenges the validity of a statute,\xe2\x80\x9d the case becomes moot \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the statute is repealed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement 17.  Thus, according to the defendants, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 racial gerrymandering claims ceased to exist when the North Carolina General Assembly enacted remedial plans for the State House and State Senate and repealed the old plans.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The defendants misunderstand the nature of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Those claims, like other racial gerrymandering claims, arise from the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that they have been \xe2\x80\x9cseparate[d] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into different districts on the basis of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Shaw </i>v. <i>Reno</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 630, 649 (1993).  Resolution of such claims will usually turn upon \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstantial evidence that race for its own sake, and not other districting principles, was the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s dominant and controlling rationale in drawing\xe2\x80\x9d the lines of legislative districts.  <i>Miller </i>v. <i>Johnson</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 900, 913 (1995).  But it is the segregation of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94not the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s line-drawing as such\xe2\x80\x94that gives rise to their claims.  It is for this reason, among others, that the plaintiffs have standing to challenge racial gerrymanders only with respect to those legislative districts in which they reside.  See <i>Alabama Legislative Black Caucus</i> v. <i>Alabama</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 6).  Here, in the remedial posture in which this case is presented, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims that they were organized into legislative districts on the basis of their race did not become moot simply because the General Assembly drew new district lines around them.  To the contrary, they argued in the District Court that some of the new districts were mere continuations of the old, gerrymandered districts.  Because the plaintiffs asserted that they remained segre- gated on the basis of race, their claims remained the subject of a live dispute, and the District Court properly retained jurisdiction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the defendants argue that the District Court erred when it \xe2\x80\x9cconclu[ded] that the General Assembly engaged in racial gerrymandering by declining to consider race.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement 20.  They assert that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no dispute that the General Assembly did <i>not </i>consider race <i>at all</i> when designing the 2017 [remedial plans]\xe2\x80\x94not as a predominant motive, a secondary motive, or otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d and that such \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed fact should have been the end of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 racial gerrymandering challenges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 21\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument suffers from the same conceptual flaws as the first.  While it may be undisputed that the 2017 legislature instructed its map drawers not to look at race when crafting a remedial map, what is also undisputed\xe2\x80\x94because the defendants do not attempt to rebut it in their jurisdictional statement or in their brief opposing the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 motion to affirm\xe2\x80\x94is the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s detailed, district-by-district factfinding respecting the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s remedial Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That factfinding, as discussed above, turned up sufficient circumstantial evidence that race was the predominant factor governing the shape of those four districts.  See, <i>e.g., </i>283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 436.  As this Court has previously explained, a plaintiff can rely upon either \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstantial evidence of a district\xe2\x80\x99s shape and demographics or more direct evidence going to legislative purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in proving a racial gerrymandering claim.  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 916.  The defendants\xe2\x80\x99 insistence that the 2017 legislature did not look at racial data in drawing remedial districts does little to undermine the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion\xe2\x80\x94based on evidence concerning the shape and demographics of those districts\xe2\x80\x94that the districts unconstitutionally sort voters on the basis of race.  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 442.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, the defendants argue that the District Court abused its discretion by arranging for the Special Master to draw up an alternative remedial map instead of giving the General Assembly\xe2\x80\x94which \xe2\x80\x9cstood ready and willing to promptly carry out its sovereign duty\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94another chance at a remedial map.  Juris. Statement 33.  Yet the District Court had its own duty to cure illegally gerrymandered districts through an orderly process in advance of elections.  See <i>Purcell </i>v. <i>Gonzalez</i>,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 4\xe2\x80\x935 (2006) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Here the District Court determined that \xe2\x80\x9cproviding the General Assembly with a second bite at the apple\xe2\x80\x9d risked \xe2\x80\x9cfurther draw[ing] out these proceedings and potentially interfer[ing] with the 2018 election cycle.\xe2\x80\x9d  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 448, n.\xc2\xa010.  We conclude that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s appointment of a Special Master in this case was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither was the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to adopt the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s recommended remedy for the racially gerrymandered districts.  The defendants argue briefly that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of that recommendation was error because the Special Master\xe2\x80\x99s remedial plan was \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly race-conscious\xe2\x80\x9d and succeeded in \xe2\x80\x9ccompel[ling] the State to employ racial quotas of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 choosing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement 34\xe2\x80\x9335.  Yet this Court has long recognized \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he distinction between being aware of racial considerations and being motivated by them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 916.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s allowance that the Special Master could \xe2\x80\x9cconsider data identifying the race of individuals or voters to the extent necessary to ensure that his plan cures the unconstitutional racial gerrymanders,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Juris. Statement 111, does not amount to a warrant for \xe2\x80\x9cracial quotas.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any event, the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 assertions on this question make no real attempt to counter the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s agreement with the Special Master that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no racial targets were sought or achieved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in drawing the remedial districts.  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 449.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">All of the foregoing is enough to convince us that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s order should be affirmed insofar as it provided a court-drawn remedy for Senate Districts 21 and 28 and House Districts 21 and 57.  The same cannot be said, however, of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s actions concerning the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s redrawing of House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties.  There the District Court proceeded from a mistaken view of its adjudicative role and its  relationship to the North Carolina General Assembly.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The only injuries the plaintiffs established in this case were that they had been placed in their legislative districts on the basis of race.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial authority was accordingly limited to ensuring that the plaintiffs were relieved of the burden of voting in racially gerrymandered legislative districts.  See <i>DaimlerChrysler Corp.</i> v. <i>Cuno</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332, 353 (2006).  But the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s revision of the House districts in Wake and Mecklenburg Counties had nothing to do with that.  Instead, the District Court redrew those districts because it found that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s revision of them violated the North Carolina Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s ban on mid-decade redistricting, not federal law.  Indeed, the District Court understood that ban to apply unless such redistricting was \xe2\x80\x9crequired by federal law or judicial order.\xe2\x80\x9d  283 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 443.
