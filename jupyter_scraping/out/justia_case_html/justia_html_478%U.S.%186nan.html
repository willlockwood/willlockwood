S. 214</a></span>.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE WHITE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In August, 1982, respondent Hardwick (hereafter respondent) was charged with violating the Georgia statute criminalizing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="188">Page 478 U. S. 188</a></p><p> sodomy [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] by committing that act with another adult male in the bedroom of respondent\'s home.  After a preliminary hearing, the District Attorney decided not to present the matter to the grand jury unless further evidence developed.</p>\n<p>Respondent then brought suit in the Federal District Court, challenging the constitutionality of the statute insofar as it criminalized consensual sodomy. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  He asserted that he was a practicing homosexual, that the Georgia sodomy statute, as administered by the defendants, placed him in imminent danger of arrest, and that the statute for several reasons violates the Federal Constitution.  The District Court granted the defendants\' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, relying on <em>Doe v. Commonwealth\'s Attorney for the City of Richmond,</em> 403 F.Supp. 1199 (ED Va.1975), which this Court summarily affirmed, 425 U.S. 901 (1976). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 478 U. S. 189</a></p><p></p>\n<p>A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed.  760 F.2d 1202 (1985).  The court first held that, because <em>Doe</em> was distinguishable and, in any event, had been undermined by later decisions, our summary affirmance in that case did not require affirmance of the District Court.  Relying on our decisions in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965); <em>Eisenstadt v. Baird,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html">405 U. S. 438</a></span> (1972); <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969); and <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html">410 U. S. 113</a></span> (1973), the court went on to hold that the Georgia statute violated respondent\'s fundamental rights because his homosexual activity is a private and intimate association that is beyond the reach of state regulation by reason of the Ninth Amendment and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The case was remanded for trial, at which, to prevail, the State would have to prove that the statute is supported by a compelling interest and is the most narrowly drawn means of achieving that end.</p>\n<p>Because other Courts of Appeals have arrived at judgments contrary to that of the Eleventh Circuit in this case, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] we granted the Attorney General\'s petition for certiorari questioning the holding that the sodomy statute violates the fundamental rights of homosexuals.  We agree with petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred, and hence reverse its judgment. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 478 U. S. 190</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This case does not require a judgment on whether laws against sodomy between consenting adults in general, or between homosexuals in particular, are wise or desirable.  It raises no question about the right or propriety of state legislative decisions to repeal their laws that criminalize homosexual sodomy, or of state court decisions invalidating those laws on state constitutional grounds.  The issue presented is whether the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy, and hence invalidates the laws of the many States that still make such conduct illegal, and have done so for a very long time.  The case also calls for some judgment about the limits of the Court\'s role in carrying out its constitutional mandate.</p>\n<p>We first register our disagreement with the Court of Appeals and with respondent that the Court\'s prior cases have construed the Constitution to confer a right of privacy that extends to homosexual sodomy and, for all intents and purposes, have decided this case.  The reach of this line of cases was sketched in <em>Carey v. Population Services International,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html">431 U. S. 678</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#685">431 U. S. 685</a></span> (1977).  <em>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/268/510/case.html">268 U. S. 510</a></span> (1925), and <em>Meyer v. Nebraska,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/262/390/case.html">262 U. S. 390</a></span> (1923), were described as dealing with childrearing and education; <em>Prince v. Massachusetts,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/158/case.html">321 U. S. 158</a></span> (1944), with family relationships; <em>Skinner v. Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/535/case.html">316 U. S. 535</a></span> (1942), with procreation; <em>Loving v. Virginia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/case.html">388 U. S. 1</a></span> (1967), with marriage; <em>Griswold v. Connecticut, supra,</em> and <em>Eisenstadt v.

The latter three cases were interpreted as construing the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to confer a fundamental individual right to decide whether or not to beget or bear a child.  <em>Carey v. Population Services International, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#688">431 U. S. 688</a></span>-689.</p>\n<p>Accepting the decisions in these cases and the above description of them, we think it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 478 U. S. 191</a></p><p> claimed constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy that is asserted in this case.  No connection between family, marriage, or procreation, on the one hand, and homosexual activity, on the other, has been demonstrated, either by the Court of Appeals or by respondent.  Moreover, any claim that these cases nevertheless stand for the proposition that any kind of private sexual conduct between consenting adults is constitutionally insulated from state proscription is unsupportable.  Indeed, the Court\'s opinion in <em>Carey</em> twice asserted that the privacy right, which the <em>Griswold</em> line of cases found to be one of the protections provided by the Due Process Clause, did not reach so far.  431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#688">431 U. S. 688</a></span>, n. 5,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html#694">431 U. S. 694</a></span>, n. 17.</p>\n<p>Precedent aside, however, respondent would have us announce, as the Court of Appeals did, a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy.  This we are quite unwilling to do.  It is true that, despite the language of the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which appears to focus only on the processes by which life, liberty, or property is taken, the cases are legion in which those Clauses have been interpreted to have substantive content, subsuming rights that to a great extent are immune from federal or state regulation or proscription.  Among such cases are those recognizing rights that have little or no textual support in the constitutional language.  <em>Meyer, Prince,</em> and <em>Pierce</em> fall in this category, as do the privacy cases from <em>Griswold</em> to <em>Carey.</em></p>\n<p>Striving to assure itself and the public that announcing rights not readily identifiable in the Constitution\'s text involves much more than the imposition of the Justices\' own choice of values on the States and the Federal Government, the Court has sought to identify the nature of the rights qualifying for heightened judicial protection.  In <em>Palko v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html">302 U. S. 319</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/case.html#325">302 U.

S. 326</a></span> (1937), it was said that this category includes those fundamental liberties that are "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty," such that "neither </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 478 U. S. 192</a></p><p> liberty nor justice would exist if [they] were sacrificed."  A different description of fundamental liberties appeared in <em>Moore v. East Cleveland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html">431 U. S. 494</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html#503">431 U. S. 503</a></span> (1977) (opinion of POWELL, J.), where they are characterized as those liberties that are "deeply rooted in this Nation\'s history and tradition."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/494/case.html#503">431 U. S. 503</a></span> (POWELL, J.).  <em>See also Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#506">381 U. S. 506</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is obvious to us that neither of these formulations would extend a fundamental right to homosexuals to engage in acts of consensual sodomy.  Proscriptions against that conduct have ancient roots.  <em>See generally</em> Survey on the Constitutional Right to Privacy in the Context of Homosexual Activity, 40 U.Miami L.Rev. 521, 525 (1986).  Sodomy was a criminal offense at common law, and was forbidden by the laws of the original 13 States when they ratified the Bill of Rights. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In 1868, when the Fourteenth Amendment was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="193">Page 478 U. S. 193</a></p><p> ratified, all but 5 of the 37 States in the Union had criminal sodomy laws. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In fact, until 1961, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] all 50 States outlawed sodomy, and today, 24 States and the District of Columbia </p><p><a class="page-number" name="194">Page 478 U. S. 194</a></p><p> continue to provide criminal penalties for sodomy performed in private and between consenting adults.  <em>See</em> Survey, U.Miami L.Rev. <em>supra,</em> at 524, n. 9.  Against this background, to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is "deeply rooted in this Nation\'s history and tradition" or "implicit in the concept of ordered liberty" is, at best, facetious.</p>\n<p>Nor are we inclined to take a more expansive view of our authority to discover new fundamental rights imbedded in the Due Process Clause.  The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judge-made constitutional law having little or no cognizable roots in the language or design of the Constitution.  That this is so was painfully demonstrated by the face-off between the Executive and the Court in the 1930\'s, which resulted in the repudiation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="195">Page 478 U. S. 195</a></p><p> of much of the substantive gloss that the Court had placed on the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  There should be, therefore, great resistance to expand the substantive reach of those Clauses, particularly if it requires redefining the category of rights deemed to be fundamental.  Otherwise, the Judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional authority.  The claimed right pressed on us today falls far short of overcoming this resistance.</p>\n<p>Respondent, however, asserts that the result should be different where the homosexual conduct occurs in the privacy of the home.  He relies on <em>Stanley v. Georgia,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html">394 U. S. 557</a></span> (1969), where the Court held that the First Amendment prevents conviction for possessing and reading obscene material in the privacy of one\'s home:</p>\n<p>"If the First Amendment means anything, it means that a State has no business telling a man, sitting alone in his house, what books he may read or what films he may watch."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#565">394 U. S. 565</a></span>.</p>\n<p><em>Stanley</em> did protect conduct that would not have been protected outside the home, and it partially prevented the enforcement of state obscenity laws; but the decision was firmly grounded in the First Amendment.  The right pressed upon us here has no similar support in the text of the Constitution, and it does not qualify for recognition under the prevailing principles for construing the Fourteenth Amendment.  Its limits are also difficult to discern.  Plainly enough, otherwise illegal conduct is not always immunized whenever it occurs in the home.  Victimless crimes, such as the possession and use of illegal drugs, do not escape the law where they are committed at home.  <em>Stanley</em> itself recognized that its holding offered no protection for the possession in the home of drugs, firearms, or stolen goods.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/case.html#568">394 U. S. 568</a></span>, n. 11.  And if respondent\'s submission is limited to the voluntary sexual conduct between consenting adults, it would be difficult, except by fiat, to limit the claimed right to homosexual conduct </p><p><a class="page-number" name="196">Page 478 U. S. 196</a></p><p> while leaving exposed to prosecution adultery, incest, and other sexual crimes even though they are committed in the home.  We are unwilling to start down that road.</p>\n<p>Even if the conduct at issue here is not a fundamental right, respondent asserts that there must be a rational basis for the law, and that there is none in this case other than the presumed belief of a majority of the electorate in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable.  This is said to be an inadequate rationale to support the law.  The law, however, is constantly based on notions of morality, and if all laws representing essentially moral choices are to be invalidated under the Due Process Clause, the courts will be very busy indeed.  Even respondent makes no such claim, but insists that majority sentiments about the morality of homosexuality should be declared inadequate.  We do not agree, and are unpersuaded that the sodomy laws of some 25 States should be invalidated on this basis. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Georgia Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 (1984) provides, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n<p>"(a) A person commits the offense of sodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another. . . ."</p>\n<p>"(b) A person convicted of the offense of sodomy shall be punished by imprisonment for not less than one nor more than 20 years. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>John and Mary Doe were also plaintiffs in the action.  They alleged that they wished to engage in sexual activity proscribed by \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 in the privacy of their home, App. 3, and that they had been "chilled and deterred" from engaging in such activity by both the existence of the statute and Hardwick\'s arrest.  <em>Id.</em> at 5.  The District Court held, however, that, because they had neither sustained, nor were in immediate danger of sustaining, any direct injury from the enforcement of the statute, they did not have proper standing to maintain the action.  <em>Id.</em> at 18.

S. 192</a></span>, the proscriptions against sodomy have very "ancient roots."  Decisions of individuals relating to homosexual conduct have been subject to state intervention throughout the history of Western civilization.  Condemnation of those practices is firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards.  Homosexual sodomy was a capital crime under Roman law.  <em>See</em> Code Theod. 9.7.6; Code Just. 9.9.31.  <em>See also</em> D. Bailey, Homosexuality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="197">Page 478 U. S. 197</a></p><p> and the Western Christian Tradition 70-81 (1975).  During the English Reformation, when powers of the ecclesiastical courts were transferred to the King\'s Courts, the first English statute criminalizing sodomy was passed.  25 Hen. VIII, ch. 6.  Blackstone described "the infamous <em>crime against nature</em>" as an offense of "deeper malignity" than rape, a heinous act "the very mention of which is a disgrace to human nature," and "a crime not fit to be named."  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *215.  The common law of England, including its prohibition of sodomy, became the received law of Georgia and the other Colonies.  In 1816, the Georgia Legislature passed the statute at issue here, and that statute has been continuously in force in one form or another since that time.  To hold that the act of homosexual sodomy is somehow protected as a fundamental right would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching.</p>\n<p>This is essentially not a question of personal "preferences," but rather of the legislative authority of the State.  I find nothing in the Constitution depriving a State of the power to enact the statute challenged here.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join the opinion of the Court.  I agree with the Court that there is no fundamental right -- <em>i.e.,</em> no substantive right under the Due Process Clause -- such as that claimed by respondent Hardwick, and found to exist by the Court of Appeals.  This is not to suggest, however, that respondent may not be protected by the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution.  The Georgia statute at issue in this case, Ga.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 (1984), authorizes a court to imprison a person for up to 20 years for a single private, consensual act of sodomy.  In my view, a prison sentence for such conduct -- certainly a sentence of long duration -- would create a serious Eighth Amendment issue.  Under the Georgia statute, a single act of sodomy, even in the private setting of a home, is a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="198">Page 478 U. S. 198</a></p><p> felony comparable in terms of the possible sentence imposed to serious felonies such as aggravated battery, \xc2\xa7 16-5-24, first-degree arson, \xc2\xa7 16-7-60, and robbery, \xc2\xa7 16-8-40. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>In this case, however, respondent has not been tried, much less convicted and sentenced. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  Moreover, respondent has not raised the Eighth Amendment issue below.

Aldredge,</em> 187 Ga. 467, 200 S.E. 799 (1939).  Moreover, the State has declined to present the criminal charge against Hardwick to a grand jury, and this is a suit for declaratory judgment brought by respondents challenging the validity of the statute.  The history of nonenforcement suggests the moribund character today of laws criminalizing this type of private, consensual conduct.  Some 26 States have repealed similar statutes.  But the constitutional validity of the Georgia statute was put in issue by respondents, and for the reasons stated by the Court, I cannot say that conduct condemned for hundreds of years has now become a fundamental right.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN, JUSTICE MARSHALL, and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>This case is no more about "a fundamental right to engage in homosexual sodomy," as the Court purports to declare, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#191">478 U.

I believe we must analyze respondent Hardwick\'s claim in the light of the values that underlie the constitutional right to privacy.  If that right means anything, it means that, before Georgia can prosecute its citizens for making choices about the most intimate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="200">Page 478 U.

State,</em> 119 Ga. 709, 721, 46 S.E. 876, 882 (1904).\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In its haste to reverse the Court of Appeals and hold that the Constitution does not "confe[r] a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#190">478 U. S. 190</a></span>, the Court relegates the actual statute being challenged to a footnote, and ignores the procedural posture of the case before it.  A fair reading of the statute and of the complaint clearly reveals that the majority has distorted the question this case presents.</p>\n<p>First, the Court\'s almost obsessive focus on homosexual activity is particularly hard to justify in light of the broad language Georgia has used.  Unlike the Court, the Georgia Legislature has not proceeded on the assumption that homosexuals are so different from other citizens that their lives may be controlled in a way that would not be tolerated if it limited the choices of those other citizens.  <em>Cf. ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#188">478 U. S. 188</a></span>, n. 2.  Rather, Georgia has provided that</p>\n<p>"[a] person commits the offense of sodomy when he performs or submits to any sexual act involving the sex organs of one person and the mouth or anus of another."</p>\n<p>Ga.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 16-6-2(a) (1984).  The sex or status of the persons who engage in the act is irrelevant as a matter of state law.  In fact, to the extent I can discern a legislative purpose for Georgia\'s 1968 enactment of \xc2\xa7 16-6-2, that purpose seems to have been to broaden the coverage of the law to reach heterosexual as well as homosexual activity. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  I therefore see no basis for the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="201">Page 478 U. S. 201</a></p><p> Court\'s decision to treat this case as an "as applied" challenge to \xc2\xa7 16-6-2, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#188">478 U. S. 188</a></span>, n. 2, or for Georgia\'s attempt, both in its brief and at oral argument, to defend \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 solely on the grounds that it prohibits homosexual activity.  Michael Hardwick\'s standing may rest in significant part on Georgia\'s apparent willingness to enforce against homosexuals a law it seems not to have any desire to enforce against heterosexuals.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 4-5; <em>cf.</em> 760 F.2d 1202, 1205-1206 (CA11 1985).  But his claim that \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 involves an unconstitutional intrusion into his privacy and his right of intimate association does not depend in any way on his sexual orientation.</p>\n<p>Second, I disagree with the Court\'s refusal to consider whether \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 runs afoul of the Eighth or Ninth Amendments or the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#196">478 U. S. 196</a></span>, n. 8.  Respondent\'s complaint expressly invoked the Ninth Amendment, <em>see</em> App. 6, and he relied heavily before this Court on <em>Griswold v.

More importantly, the procedural posture of the case requires that we affirm the Court of Appeals\' judgment if there is <em>any</em> ground on which respondent may be entitled to relief.

Thus, even if respondent did not advance claims based on the Eighth or Ninth Amendments, or on the Equal Protection Clause, his complaint should not be dismissed if any of those provisions could entitle him to relief.  I need not reach either the Eighth Amendment or the Equal Protection Clause issues, because I believe that Hardwick has stated a cognizable claim that \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 interferes with constitutionally protected interests in privacy and freedom of intimate association.

In construing the right to privacy, the Court has proceeded along two somewhat distinct, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 478 U. S. 204</a></p><p> albeit complementary, lines.  First, it has recognized a privacy interest with reference to certain decisions that are properly for the individual to make.  <em>E.g., Roe v.

Second, it has recognized a privacy interest with reference to certain places without regard for the particular activities in which the individuals who occupy them are engaged.  <em>E.g., United States v.

The fact that individuals define themselves in a significant way through their intimate sexual relationships with others suggests, in a Nation as diverse as ours, that there may be many "right" ways of conducting those relationships, and that much of the richness of a relationship will come from the freedom an individual has to choose the form and nature of these intensely personal bonds.  <em>See</em> Karst, The Freedom of Intimate Association, 89 Yale L.J. 624, 637 (1980); <em>cf.

The Court\'s treatment of this aspect of the case is symptomatic of its overall refusal to consider the broad principles that have informed our treatment of privacy in specific cases.  Just as the right to privacy is more than the mere aggregation of a number of entitlements to engage in specific behavior, so too protecting the physical integrity of the home is more than merely a means of protecting specific activities that often take place there.

According to the majority here, <em>Stanley</em> relied entirely on the First Amendment, and thus, it is claimed, sheds no light on cases not involving printed materials.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#195">478 U. S. 195</a></span>.  But that is not what <em>Stanley</em> said.  Rather, the <em>Stanley</em> Court anchored its holding in the Fourth Amendment\'s special protection for the individual in his home:</p>\n<p>"\'The makers of our Constitution undertook to secure conditions favorable to the pursuit of happiness.  They recognized the significance of man\'s spiritual nature, of his feelings and of his intellect.  They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things.  They sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their emotions and their sensations.\'"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"These are the rights that appellant is asserting in the case before us.

"The right of the people to be secure in their . . . houses," expressly guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment, is perhaps the most "textual" of the various constitutional provisions that inform our understanding of the right to privacy, and thus I cannot agree with the Court\'s statement that "[t]he right pressed upon us here has no . . . support in the text of the Constitution," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#195">478 U.

That certain, but by no means all, religious groups condemn the behavior at issue gives the State no license to impose their judgments on the entire citizenry.  The legitimacy of secular legislation depends, instead, on whether the State can advance some justification for its law beyond its conformity to religious doctrine.  <em>See, e.g., McGowan v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/case.html">366 U.

I can only hope that here, too, the Court soon will reconsider its analysis and conclude that depriving individuals of the right to choose for themselves how to conduct their intimate relationships poses a far greater threat to the values most deeply rooted in our Nation\'s history than tolerance of nonconformity could ever do.

If it were necessary to distinguish between "acts" and "conditions" for purposes of the Eighth Amendment, I would adhere to the concept of "condition" implicit in the opinion in <em>Robinson.</em> . . .

But, obviously, neither is it simply a matter of deliberate personal election.  Homosexual orientation may well form part of the very fiber of an individual\'s personality.  Consequently, under JUSTICE WHITE\'s analysis in <em>Powell,</em> the Eighth Amendment may pose a constitutional barrier to sending an individual to prison for acting on that attraction regardless of the circumstances.  An individual\'s ability to make constitutionally protected "decisions concerning sexual relations," <em>Carey v.

The legislature having decided that the sex of the participants is irrelevant to the legality of the acts, I do not see why the State can defend \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 on the ground that individuals singled out for prosecution are of the same sex as their partners.  Thus, under the circumstances of this case, a claim under the Equal Protection Clause may well be available without having to reach the more controversial question whether homosexuals are a suspect class.  <em>See, e.g., Rowland v. Mad River Local School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/1009/case.html">470 U.

The connection between the acts prohibited by \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 and the harms identified by petitioner in his brief before this Court is a subject of hot dispute, hardly amenable to dismissal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6).  <em>Compare, e.g.,</em> Brief for Petitioner 36-37 and Brief for David Robinson, Jr., as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23-28, on the one hand, <em>with People v.

S. 196</a></span>), on the other.  For example, marriage, in addition to its spiritual aspects, is a civil contract that entitles the contracting parties to a variety of governmentally provided benefits.  A State might define the contractual commitment necessary to become eligible for these benefits to include a commitment of fidelity, and then punish individuals for breaching that contract.  Moreover, a State might conclude that adultery is likely to injure third persons, in particular, spouses and children of persons who engage in extramarital affairs.  With respect to incest, a court might well agree with respondent that the nature of familial relationships renders true consent to incestuous activity sufficiently problematical that a blanket prohibition of such activity is warranted.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 21-22.  Notably, the Court makes no effort to explain why it has chosen to group private, consensual homosexual activity with adultery and incest, rather than with private, consensual heterosexual activity by unmarried persons or, indeed, with oral or anal sex within marriage.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/5" name="F3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The parallel between <em>Loving</em> and this case is almost uncanny.  There, too, the State relied on a religious justification for its law.  <em>Compare</em> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/case.html#3">388 U.

There, too, defenders of the challenged statute relied heavily on the fact that, when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, most of the States had similar prohibitions.  <em>Compare</em> Brief for Appellee in <em>Loving v. Virginia,</em> O.T. 1966, No. 395, pp. 28-29, <em>with ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#192">478 U. S. 192</a></span>-194, and n. 6.  There, too, at the time the case came before the Court, many of the States still had criminal statutes concerning the conduct at issue.  <em>Compare</em> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/1/case.html#6">388 U.

It was not until 1533 that sodomy was made a secular offense in England.  25 Hen. VIII, ch. 6. Until that time, the offense  was, in Sir James Stephen\'s words, "merely ecclesiastical."  2 J. Stephen, A History of the Criminal Law of England 429-430 (1883).  Pollock and Maitland similarly observed that "[t]he crime against nature . . . was so closely connected with heresy that the vulgar had but one name for both."  2 F. Pollock &amp; F. Maitland, The History of English Law 554 (1895).  The transfer of jurisdiction over prosecutions for sodomy to the secular courts seems primarily due to the alteration of ecclesiastical jurisdiction attendant on England\'s break with the Roman Catholic Church, rather than to any new understanding of the sovereign\'s interest in preventing or punishing the behavior involved.  <em>Cf.</em> 6 E. Coke, Institutes, ch. 10 (4th ed. 1797).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/7" name="F3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]</p>\n<p>At oral argument, a suggestion appeared that, while the Fourth Amendment\'s special protection of the home might prevent the State from enforcing \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 against individuals who engage in consensual sexual activity there, that protection would not make the statute invalid.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 10-11.  The suggestion misses the point entirely.  If the law is not invalid, then the police can invade the home to enforce it, provided, of course, that they obtain a determination of probable cause from a neutral magistrate.  One of the reasons for the Court\'s holding in <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965), was precisely the possibility, and repugnancy, of permitting searches to obtain evidence regarding the use of contraceptives.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#485">381 U. S. 485</a></span>-486.  Permitting the kinds of searches that might be necessary to obtain evidence of the sexual activity banned by \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 seems no less intrusive or repugnant.  <em>Cf. Winston v. Lee,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/753/case.html">470 U. S. 753</a></span> (1985); <em>Mary Beth G. v.

[<a href="#F4/2" name="T4/2">Footnote 4/2</a>]  Sodomy was condemned as an odious and sinful type of behavior during the formative period of the common law. [<a href="#F4/3" name="T4/3">Footnote 4/3</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="215">Page 478 U. S. 215</a></p><p> That condemnation was equally damning for heterosexual and homosexual sodomy. [<a href="#F4/4" name="T4/4">Footnote 4/4</a>]  Moreover, it provided no special exemption for married couples. [<a href="#F4/5" name="T4/5">Footnote 4/5</a>]  The license to cohabit and to produce legitimate offspring simply did not include any permission to engage in sexual conduct that was considered a "crime against nature."</p>\n<p>The history of the Georgia statute before us clearly reveals this traditional prohibition of heterosexual, as well as homosexual, sodomy. [<a href="#F4/6" name="T4/6">Footnote 4/6</a>]  Indeed, at one point in the 20th century, Georgia\'s law was construed to permit certain sexual conduct between homosexual women even though such conduct was prohibited between heterosexuals. [<a href="#F4/7" name="T4/7">Footnote 4/7</a>]  The history of the statutes cited by the majority as proof for the proposition that sodomy is not constitutionally protected, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#192">478 U. S. 192</a></span>-194, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 478 U. S. 216</a></p><p> and nn. 5 and 6, similarly reveals a prohibition on heterosexual, as well as homosexual, sodomy. [<a href="#F4/8" name="T4/8">Footnote 4/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Because the Georgia statute expresses the traditional view that sodomy is an immoral kind of conduct regardless of the identity of the persons who engage in it, I believe that a proper analysis of its constitutionality requires consideration of two questions:  first, may a State totally prohibit the described conduct by means of a neutral law applying without exception to all persons subject to its jurisdiction?  If not, may the State save the statute by announcing that it will only enforce the law against homosexuals?  The two questions merit separate discussion.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our prior cases make two propositions abundantly clear.  First, the fact that the governing majority in a State has traditionally viewed a particular practice as immoral is not a sufficient reason for upholding a law prohibiting the practice; neither history nor tradition could save a law prohibiting miscegenation from constitutional attack. [<a href="#F4/9" name="T4/9">Footnote 4/9</a>]  Second, individual decisions by married persons, concerning the intimacies of their physical relationship, even when not intended to produce offspring, are a form of "liberty" protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Griswold v. Connecticut,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html">381 U. S. 479</a></span> (1965).  Moreover, this protection extends to intimate choices by unmarried, as well as married, persons.  <em>Carey v. Population Services International,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/678/case.html">431 U. S. 678</a></span> (1977); <em>Eisenstadt v.

S. 217</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In consideration of claims of this kind, the Court has emphasized the individual interest in privacy, but its decisions have actually been animated by an even more fundamental concern.  As I wrote some years ago:</p>\n<p>"These cases do not deal with the individual\'s interest in protection from unwarranted public attention, comment, or exploitation.  They deal, rather, with the individual\'s right to make certain unusually important decisions that will affect his own, or his family\'s, destiny.  The Court has referred to such decisions as implicating \'basic values,\' as being \'fundamental,\' and as being dignified by history and tradition.  The character of the Court\'s language in these cases brings to mind the origins of the American heritage of freedom -- the abiding interest in individual liberty that makes certain state intrusions on the citizen\'s right to decide how he will live his own life intolerable.  Guided by history, our tradition of respect for the dignity of individual choice in matters of conscience and the restraints implicit in the federal system, federal judges have accepted the responsibility for recognition and protection of these rights in appropriate cases."</p>\n<p><em>Fitzgerald v. Porter Memorial Hospital,</em> 523 F.2d 716, 719-720 (CA7 1975) (footnotes omitted), <em>cert. denied,</em> 425 U.S. 916 (1976).</p>\n<p>Society has every right to encourage its individual members to follow particular traditions in expressing affection for one another and in gratifying their personal desires.  It, of course, may prohibit an individual from imposing his will on another to satisfy his own selfish interests.  It also may prevent an individual from interfering with, or violating, a legally sanctioned and protected relationship, such as marriage.  And it may explain the relative advantages and disadvantages of different forms of intimate expression.  But when individual married couples are isolated from observation by others, the way in which they voluntarily choose to conduct their intimate relations is a matter for them -- not the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 478 U. S. 218</a></p><p> State -- to decide. [<a href="#F4/10" name="T4/10">Footnote 4/10</a>]  The essential "liberty" that animated the development of the law in cases like <em>Griswold, Eisenstadt,</em> and <em>Carey</em> surely embraces the right to engage in nonreproductive sexual conduct that others may consider offensive or immoral.</p>\n<p>Paradoxical as it may seem, our prior cases thus establish that a State may not prohibit sodomy within "the sacred precincts of marital bedrooms," <em>Griswold,</em> 381 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/case.html#485">381 U. S. 485</a></span>, or, indeed, between unmarried heterosexual adults.  <em>Eisenstadt,</em> 405 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/438/case.html#453">405 U. S. 453</a></span>.  In all events, it is perfectly clear that the State of Georgia may not totally prohibit the conduct proscribed by \xc2\xa7 16-6-2 of the Georgia Criminal Code.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>If the Georgia statute cannot be enforced as it is written -- if the conduct it seeks to prohibit is a protected form of liberty for the vast majority of Georgia\'s citizens -- the State must assume the burden of justifying a selective application of its law.  Either the persons to whom Georgia seeks to apply its statute do not have the same interest in "liberty" that others have, or there must be a reason why the State may be permitted to apply a generally applicable law to certain persons that it does not apply to others.</p>\n<p>The first possibility is plainly unacceptable.  Although the meaning of the principle that "all men are created equal" is not always clear, it surely must mean that every free citizen has the same interest in "liberty" that the members of the majority share.  From the standpoint of the individual, the homosexual and the heterosexual have the same interest in deciding how he will live his own life, and, more narrowly, how he will conduct himself in his personal and voluntary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="219">Page 478 U. S. 219</a></p><p> associations with his companions.  State intrusion into the private conduct of either is equally burdensome.</p>\n<p>The second possibility is similarly unacceptable.  A policy of selective application must be supported by a neutral and legitimate interest -- something more substantial than a habitual dislike for, or ignorance about, the disfavored group.  Neither the State nor the Court has identified any such interest in this case.  The Court has posited as a justification for the Georgia statute "the presumed belief of a majority of the electorate in Georgia that homosexual sodomy is immoral and unacceptable."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#196">478 U. S. 196</a></span>.  But the Georgia electorate has expressed no such belief -- instead, its representatives enacted a law that presumably reflects the belief that <em>all sodomy</em> is immoral and unacceptable.  Unless the Court is prepared to conclude that such a law is constitutional, it may not rely on the work product of the Georgia Legislature to support its holding.  For the Georgia statute does not single out homosexuals as a separate class meriting special disfavored treatment.</p>\n<p>Nor, indeed, does the Georgia prosecutor even believe that all homosexuals who violate this statute should be punished.  This conclusion is evident from the fact that the respondent in this very case has formally acknowledged in his complaint and in court that he has engaged, and intends to continue to engage, in the prohibited conduct, yet the State has elected not to process criminal charges against him.  As JUSTICE POWELL points out, moreover, Georgia\'s prohibition on private, consensual sodomy has not been enforced for decades.

At the very least, I think it clear at this early stage of the litigation that respondent has alleged a constitutional claim sufficient to withstand a motion to dismiss.

This prohibition of heterosexual sodomy was not purely hortatory.  <em>See, e.g., Comer v.

Significantly, Georgia passed the current statute three years after the Court\'s decision in <em>Griswold.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/11" name="F4/11">Footnote 4/11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/186/case.html#198">478 U.

Since the Georgia Attorney General does not even defend the statute as written, however, <em>see</em> <l=|478 10|="" 186fn4="" u.s.="">n. 10, <em>supra,</em> the State cannot possibly rest on the notion that the statute may be defended for its symbolic message.</l=|478></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4/13" name="F4/13">Footnote 4/13</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, at this stage, it appears that the statute indiscriminately authorizes a policy of selective prosecution that is neither limited to the class of homosexual persons nor embraces all persons in that class, but rather applies to those who may be arbitrarily selected by the prosecutor for reasons that are not revealed either in the record of this case or in the text of the statute.  If that is true, although the text of the statute is clear enough, its true meaning may be "so intolerably vague that evenhanded enforcement of the law is a virtual impossibility."  <em>Marks v.
