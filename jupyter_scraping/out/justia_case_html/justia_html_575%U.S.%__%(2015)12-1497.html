He subsequently filed a <i>qui tam </i>complaint (<i>Carter I</i>), alleging that petitioners, who are defense contractors and related entities, had fraudulently billed the Government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.  In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed the parties that an earlier-filed <i>qui tam </i>suit (<i>Thorpe</i>) had similar claims, leading the District Court to dismiss <i>Carter I </i>without prejudice under the first-to-file bar.  While respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, <i>Thorpe </i>was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (<i>Carter II</i>), but the court dismissed it under the first-to-file rule because <i>Carter I</i>\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending.  Respondent then dismissed that appeal, and in June 2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, filed the instant complaint (<i>Carter III</i>).  The District Court dismissed this complaint with prejudice under the first-to-file rule because of a pending Maryland suit.  Further, because the WSLA applies only to criminal charges, the court reasoned, all but one of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s civil actions were untimely.  Reversing, the Fourth Circuit concluded that the WSLA applied to civil claims and that the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed.  Since any pending suits had by then been dismissed, the court held, respondent had the right to refile his case.  It thus remanded <i>Carter III</i> with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0As shown by the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and history, the Act applies only to criminal offenses, not to civil claims like those in this case.

Both extended the statute of limitations for fraud offenses \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under any existing statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Since only crimes are \xe2\x80\x9cindictable,\xe2\x80\x9d these provisions quite clearly were limited to criminal charges.  In 1944, Congress made the WSLA prospectively applicable to future wartime frauds rather than merely applicable to past frauds as earlier versions had been.  In doing so, it deleted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under any statute,\xe2\x80\x9d so that the WSLA now applied to \xe2\x80\x9cany offense against the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Congress made additional changes in 1948 and codified the WSLA in Title 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Section 3287\xe2\x80\x99s text supports limiting the WSLA to criminal charges.  The term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d<i> </i>is most commonly used to refer to crimes, especially given the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s location in Title 18, titled \xe2\x80\x9cCrimes and Criminal Procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d where no provision appears to employ \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d to denote a civil violation rather than a civil penalty attached to a criminal offense.  And when Title 18 was enacted in 1948, its very first provision classified all offenses as crimes.  In similar circumstances, this Court has regarded a provision\xe2\x80\x99s placement as relevant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal.  <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Hendricks</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346\n.  The WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s history provides further support for this reading.  The term \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1921 and 1942 statutes, the parties agree, applied only to crimes.  And it is improbable that the 1944 Act\xe2\x80\x99s removal of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under any statute\xe2\x80\x9d had the effect of sweeping in civil claims, a fundamental change in scope not typically accomplished with so subtle a move.  The more plausible explanation is that Congress removed that phrase in order to change the WSLA from a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a permanent measure applicable to future fraud as well.  If there were any ambiguity in the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense,\xe2\x80\x9d that ambiguity should be resolved in favor of a narrower definition.  See <i>Bridges </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209, 216.

This reading of \xc2\xa73730(b)(5) is in accordance with the ordinary dictionary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending.\xe2\x80\x9d  Contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be seen as a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cshort-hand\xe2\x80\x9d for first-filed, which is neither a lengthy nor a complex term.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 reading would also bar even a suit dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with the merits, such as <i>Thorpe, </i>which was dismissed for failure to prosecute.

From January to April 2005, respondent worked in Iraq for one of the petitioners as a water purification operator.  He subsequently filed a <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam </i>complaint against petitioners (<i>Carter I</i>), alleging that they had fraudulently billed the Government for water purification services that were not performed or not performed properly.  The Government declined to intervene.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2010, shortly before trial, the Government informed the parties about an earlier filed <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam </i>lawsuit,<i> United States ex\xc2\xa0rel.

This initiated a remarkable sequence of dismissals and filings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The District Court held that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suit was related to <i>Thorpe</i> and thus dismissed his case without prejudice under the first-to-file bar.  Respondent appealed, and while his appeal was pending, <i>Thorpe </i>was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Respondent quickly filed a new complaint (<i>Carter II</i>), but the District Court dismissed this second complaint under the first-to-file rule because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s own earlier case was still pending on appeal.  Respondent then voluntarily dismissed this appeal, and in June 2011, more than six years after the alleged fraud, he filed yet another complaint (<i>Carter III\xc2\xa0</i>), and it is this complaint that is now at issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners sought dismissal of this third complaint under the first-to-file rule, pointing to two allegedly related cases, one in Maryland and one in Texas, that had been filed in the interim between the filing of <i>Carter I</i> and <i>Carter III.</i>  This time, the court dismissed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s complaint with prejudice.  The court held that the latest complaint was barred under the first-to-file rule because the Maryland suit was already pending when that complaint was filed.  The court also ruled that the WSLA applies only to criminal charges and thus did not suspend the time for filing respondent\xe2\x80\x99s civil claims.  As a result, the court concluded, all but one of those claims were untimely because they were filed more than six years after the alleged wrongdoing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fourth Circuit reversed, rejecting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of both the WSLA and first-to-file issues.  <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel.

Concluding that the WSLA applies to civil claims based on fraud committed during the conflict in Iraq,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] the Court of Appeals held that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claims had been filed on time.  The Court of Appeals also held that the first-to-file bar ceases to apply once a related action is dismissed.  Since the Maryland and Texas cases had been dismissed by the time of the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the court held that respondent had the right to refile his case.  The Court of Appeals thus remanded <i>Carter III</i> with instructions to dismiss without prejudice.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">After this was done, respondent filed <i>Carter IV</i>, but the District Court dismissed <i>Carter IV</i> on the ground that the petition for a writ of certiorari in <i>Carter III</i> (the case now before us) was still pending.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted that petition, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and we now reverse in part and affirm in part.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The text, structure, and history of the WSLA show that the Act applies only to criminal offenses.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s roots extend back to the time after the end of World War I.  Concerned about war-related frauds, Congress in 1921 enacted a statute that extended the statute of limitations for such offenses.  The new law provided as follows: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n offenses involving the defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States or any agency thereof .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and <i>now indictable under any existing statutes</i>, the period of limitations shall be six years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act ofNov. 17, 1921, ch. 124,\n\n42Stat.\n220 (emphasis added).  Since only crimes are \xe2\x80\x9cindictable,\xe2\x80\x9d this provision quite clearly was limited to the filing of criminal charges.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 1942, after the United States entered World War II, Congress enacted a similar suspension statute.  This law, like its predecessor, applied to fraud \xe2\x80\x9coffenses .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. now indictable under any existing statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d but this time the law suspended \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexisting statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d until the fixed date of June 30, 1945.  Act of Aug. 24, 1942, ch. 555,\n\n56Stat.\n747\xe2\x80\x93748.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As that date approached, Congress decided to adopt a suspension statute which would remain in force for the duration of the war.  Congress amended the 1942 WSLA in three important ways.  First, Congress deleted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under any statute,\xe2\x80\x9d so that the WSLA was made to apply simply to \xe2\x80\x9cany offense against the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n58Stat.\n667.  Second, although previous versions of the WSLA were of definite duration, Congress now suspended the limitations period for the open-ended timeframe of \xe2\x80\x9cthree years after the termination of hostilities in the present war as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of the two Houses of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>. <i> </i>Third, Congress expanded the statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage beyond offenses \xe2\x80\x9cinvolving defrauding or attempts to defraud the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to include other offenses pertaining to Government contracts and the handling and disposal of Government property. <i>Ibid</i>., and \xc2\xa728,\n\n58Stat.\n781.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Congress made more changes in 1948.  From then until 2008, the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s relevant language was as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the United States is at war the running of any statute of limitations applicable to any offense (1) involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United States or any agency thereof in any manner, whether by conspiracy or not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be suspended until three years after the termination of hostilities as proclaimed by the President or by a concurrent resolution of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of June 25, 1948, \xc2\xa73287,\n\n62Stat.\n828.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition, Congress codified the WSLA in Title 18 ofthe United States Code, titled \xe2\x80\x9cCrimes and Criminal Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, in 2008, Congress once again amended the WSLA, this time in two relevant ways.  First, as noted, Congress changed the Act\xe2\x80\x99s triggering event, providing that tolling is available not only \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the United States is at war,\xe2\x80\x9d but also when Congress has enacted a specific authorization for the use of military force. Second, Congress extended the suspension period from three to five years.  \xc2\xa7855,\n\n122Stat.\n4545<i>.</i>[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With this background in mind, we turn to the question whether the WSLA applies to civil claims as well as criminal charges.  We hold that the Act applies only to the latter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We begin with the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s text.  The WSLA suspends \xe2\x80\x9cthe running of any statute of limitations applicable to any <i>offense </i>.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. involving fraud or attempted fraud against the United States or any agency thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73287 (emphasis added).  The term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d is most commonly used to refer to crimes.  At the time of both the 1948 and 2008 amendments to the Act, the primary definition of \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d in Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary referred to crime.  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1110 (8th ed. 2004) (Black\xe2\x80\x99s) (\xe2\x80\x9cA violation of the law; a crime, often a minor one.  See crime\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1232 (4th ed. 1951) (\xe2\x80\x9cA crime or misdemeanor; a breach of the criminal laws\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id</i>., at 1282 (3d ed. 1933) (same).  The 1942 edition of Webster\xe2\x80\x99s similarly states that \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chas no technical legal meaning; but it is sometimes used specifically for an indictable crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and sometimes for a misdemeanor or wrong punishable only by fine or penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1690 (2d ed.).  See also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1566 (1976) (Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third) (\xe2\x80\x9can infraction of law: crime, misdemeanor\xe2\x80\x9d); American Heritage Dictionary 1255 (3d ed. 1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cA transgression of law; a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is true that the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d is sometimes used more broadly.  For instance, the 1948 edition of Ballentine\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary cautions: \xe2\x80\x9cThe words \xe2\x80\x98crime\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98offense\xe2\x80\x99 are not necessarily synonymous.  All crimes are offenses, but some offenses are not crimes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ballentine\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 900.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But while the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d is sometimes used in this way, that is not how the word is used in Title 18.  Al-though the term appears hundreds of times in Title 18, neither respondent nor the Solicitor General, appearing as an <i>amicus</i> in support of respondent, has been able to find a single provision of that title in which \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d is employed to denote a civil violation.  The Solicitor General cites eight provisions,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] but not one actually labels a civil wrong as an \xe2\x80\x9coffense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, they all simply attach civil penalties to criminal offenses\xe2\x80\x94as the Deputy Solicitor General acknowledged at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not only is this pattern of usage telling, but when Title 18 was enacted in 1948, the very first provision, what was then\n\n18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa71, classified all offenses as crimes.  That provision read in pertinent part as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71.  Offenses classified.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any Act of Congress to thecontrary:</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) Any offense punishable by death or imprisonment for a term exceeding one year is a felony.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\xe2\x80\x9c(2) Any other offense is a misdemeanor.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n62Stat.\n684 (repealed Oct. 12, 1984).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Solicitor General correctly points out that regulatory provisions outside Title 18 sometimes use the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d to describe a civil violation, see Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10 (United States Brief), but it is significant that Congress chose to place the WSLA in Title 18.  Although we have cautioned against \xe2\x80\x9cplac[ing] too much significance on the location of a statute in the United States Code,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jones </i>v. <i>R.\xc2\xa0R. Donnelley &amp; Sons Co., </i>\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 369,\n376 (2004)\n, we have in similar circumstances regarded the placement of a provision as relevant in determining whether its content is civil or criminal in nature, see <i>Kansas </i>v. <i>Hendricks</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346,\n361 (1997)\n.  It is also revealing that Congress has used clearer and more specific language when it has wanted to toll the statutes of limitations for civil suits as well as crimes.  Only two months after enacting the WSLA, Congress passed a tolling statute for \xe2\x80\x9cviolations of the antitrust laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. now indictable <i>or subject to civil proceedings</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Oct. 10, 1942, ch. 589,\n\n56Stat.\n781 (emphasisadded).  Congress obviously could have included a similar \xe2\x80\x9ccivil proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d clause in the WSLA, but it did notdo so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s history provides what is perhaps the strongest support for the conclusion that it applies only to criminal charges.  The parties do not dispute that the term \xe2\x80\x9coffenses\xe2\x80\x9d in the 1921 and 1942 suspension statutes applied only to crimes, Brief for Petitioners 23; Brief for Respondent at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, and after 1942, the WSLA continued to use that same term.  The retention of the same term in the later laws suggests that no fundamental alteration was intended.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent and the Government latch onto the 1944 Act\xe2\x80\x99s removal of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under any statute\xe2\x80\x9d and argue that this deletion had the effect of sweeping in civil claims, but this argument is most improbable.  Simply deleting the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable under the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d while leaving the operative term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d unchanged would have been an obscure way of substantially expanding the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Fundamental changes in the scope of a statute are not typically accomplished with so subtle a move.  Converting the WSLA from a provision that suspended the statute of limitations for criminal prosecutions into one that also suspended the time for commencing a civil action would have been a big step.  If Congress had meant to make such a change, we would expect it to have used language that made this important modification clear to litigants and courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the significance of the deletion of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indict-able\xe2\x80\x9d  ignores a more plausible explanation, namely, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to make the WSLA applicable, not just to offenses committed in the past during or in the aftermath of particular wars, but also to future offenses committed during future wars.  When the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable\xe2\x80\x9d first appeared in the 1921 Act, it meant that the statute of limitations was suspended for only those crimes that had already been committed when the Act took effect.  This made sense because the 1921 Act was a temporary measure enacted to deal with problems resulting from the First World War.  The 1942 Act simply \xe2\x80\x9creadopt[ed] the [same] World War I policy\xe2\x80\x9d to deal with claims during World War II.  <i>Bridges</i> v. <i>United States,</i>\n\n346 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209,\n219 (1953)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 1944 amendments, however, changed the WSLA from a retroactive measure designed to deal exclusively with past fraud into a measure applicable to future fraud as well.  In order to complete this transformation, it was necessary to remove the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable,\xe2\x80\x9d which, as noted, limited the applicability of the suspension to offenses committed in the past.  Thus, the removal of the \xe2\x80\x9cnow indictable\xe2\x80\x9d provision was more plausibly driven by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to apply the WSLA prospectively, not by any desire to expand the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s reach to civil suits.  For all these reasons, we think it clear that the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d in the WSLA applies solely to crimes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But even if there were some ambiguity in the WSLA\xe2\x80\x99s use of that term, our cases instruct us to resolve that ambiguity in favor of the narrower definition.  We have said that the WSLA should be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly construed\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98interpreted in favor of repose.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 216 (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Scharton</i>,\n\n285 U.\xc2\xa0S. 518\n\xe2\x80\x93522 (1932).  Applying that principle here means that the term \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d must be construed to refer only to crimes.  Because this case involves civil claims, the WSLA does not suspend the applicable statute of limitations under either the 1948 or the 2008 version of the statute.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners acknowledge that respondent has raised other arguments that, if successful, could render at least one claim timely on remand.  We therefore consider whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claims must be dismissed with prejudice under the first-to-file rule.  We conclude that dismissal with prejudice was not called for.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first-to-file bar provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a person brings an action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. no person other than the Government may intervene or bring a related action based on the facts underlying the <i>pending</i> action.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n31 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(b)(5) (emphasis added).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9c[r]emaining undecided; awaiting decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1314 (10th ed. 2014).  See also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 1669 (1976) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cnot yet decided: in continuance: in suspense\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the reference to a \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d action in the FCA is interpreted in this way, an earlier suit bars a later suit while the earlier suit remains undecided but ceases to bar that suit once it is dismissed.  We see no reason not to interpret the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d in the FCA in accordance with its ordinary meaning.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners argue that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d in a very different\xe2\x80\x94and very peculiar\xe2\x80\x94way.  In the FCA, according to petitioners, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cis \xe2\x80\x98used as a short-hand for the first filed action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 44.  Thus, as petitioners see things, the first-filed action remains \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d even after it has been dismissed, and it forever bars any subsequent related action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This interpretation does not comport with any known usage of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under this interpretation, <i>Marbury </i>v.<i> Madison</i>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), is still \xe2\x80\x9cpending.\xe2\x80\x9d  So is the trial of Socrates.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners say that Congress used the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d in the FCA as a sort of \xe2\x80\x9cshort-hand,\xe2\x80\x9d but a shorthand phrase or term is employed to provide a succinct way of expressing a concept that would otherwise require a lengthy or complex formulation.  Here, we are told that \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d is shorthand for \xe2\x80\x9cfirst-filed,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that is neither lengthy nor complex.  And if Congress had wanted to adopt the rule that petitioners favor, the task could have been accomplished in other equally economical ways\xe2\x80\x94for example, by replacing \xe2\x80\x9cpending,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cearlier\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cprior.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Not only does petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument push the term \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d far beyond the breaking point, but it wouldlead to strange results that Congress is unlikely to have wanted.  Under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation, a first-filed suit would bar all subsequent related suits even if that earlier suit was dismissed for a reason having nothing to do with the merits.  Here, for example, the <i>Thorpe</i> suit, which provided the ground for the initial invocation of the first-to-file rule, was dismissed for failure to prosecute.  Why would Congress want the abandonment of an earlier suit to bar a later potentially successful suit that might result in a large recovery for the Government?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners contend that interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d to mean pending would produce practical problems, and there is some merit to their arguments.  In particular, as petitioners note, if the first-to-file bar is lifted once the first-filed action ends, defendants may be reluctant to settle such actions for the full amount that they would accept if there were no prospect of subsequent suits asserting the same claims.  See Brief for Petitioners at 56\xe2\x80\x9357.  Respondent and the United States argue that the doctrine of claim preclusion may protect defendants if the first-filed action is decided on the merits, <i>id.</i>, at 60\xe2\x80\x9361; United States Brief 30, but that issue is not before us in this case.  The False Claims Act\xe2\x80\x99s <i>qui tam</i> provisions present many interpretive challenges, and it is beyond our ability in this case to make them operate together smoothly like a finely tuned machine.  We hold that a <i>qui tam</i> suit under the FCA ceases to be \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d once it is dismissed.  We therefore agree with the Fourth Circuit that the dismissal with prejudice of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s one live claim was error.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit is reversed in part and affirmed in part, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002,\n\n116Stat.\n1498, note following\n\n50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71541, p. 312, was sufficient to satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9cat war\xe2\x80\x9d requirement in the pre-2008 version of the WSLA.
