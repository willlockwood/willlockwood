If the two states will agree upon these surveys </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 197 U. S. 578</a></p><p> and locations as correctly marking the original banks of the river and the middle of the old channel, the Court will, by decree, give effect to that agreement, or, if either state desires a new survey, the Court will order one to be made, and will cause monuments to be placed so as to permanently mark the boundary lines between the two states.  The disposition of the case by final decree is postponed for forty days in order that the Court may be advised as to the wishes of the parties in respect to these details."</p>\n<p>"In pursuance whereof, now come the parties hereto by their respective counsel and agree that the said surveys made by the County Surveyors of Nemaha County, Nebraska, and Atchison County, Missouri, as reported by the Commissioners and set forth in the opinion of the Court, constitute and be correct boundary lines between the said states, the same constituting the middle of the old channel of Missouri River as found by said Court in its in its opinion."</p>\n<p>"It is further agreed between the parties hereto that the monuments marking said boundary line established by the said county surveyors of said counties are not of a permanent character, and many of them have become destroyed or removed, and that, in order to mark a permanent boundary line, it is necessary and is deemed best that permanent monuments be erected at regular intervals on said line in such manner as will quiet all dispute in reference to said boundary."</p>\n<p>"It is further agreed that said permanent monuments can be best established under the supervision of the Commissioners heretofore appointed by the Court, to-wit, Alfred Hazlett and John W. Halliburton, and it is therefore requested by the parties to this cause that the Court, by a proper order, direct and require said Commissioners to establish or cause to be established under their direction such permanent monuments as may by them be deemed necessary in the premises and in accordance with the order of the Court heretofore made, and make a report to the Court of their acts and doings therein.  In the execution of their powers herein, said Commissioners </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 197 U.
