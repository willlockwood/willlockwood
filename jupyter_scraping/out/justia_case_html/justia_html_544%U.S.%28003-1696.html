S. 413</a>, and in <em>District of Columbia Court of Appeals</em> v. <em>Feldman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/462/index.html">460 U. S. 462</a>.  In <em>Rooker,</em> plaintiffs previously defeated in state court filed suit in a Federal District Court alleging that the adverse state-court judgment was unconstitutional and asking that it be declared \xe2\x80\x9cnull and void.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 U. S., at 414\xe2\x80\x93415.  Noting preliminarily that the state court had acted within its jurisdiction, this Court explained that if the state-court decision was wrong, \xe2\x80\x9cthat did not make the judgment void, but merely left it open to reversal or modification in an appropriate and timely appellate proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 415.  Federal district courts, <em>Rooker </em>recognized, are empowered to exercise only original, not appellate, jurisdictions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 416.  Because Congress has empowered this Court alone to exercise appellate authority \xe2\x80\x9cto reverse or modify\xe2\x80\x9d a state-court judgment, <em>ibid.,</em> the Court affirmed a decree dismissing the federal suit for lack of jurisdiction, <em>id.,</em> at 415, 417.  In <em>Feldman,</em> two plaintiffs brought federal-court actions after the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x99s highest court denied their petitions to waive a court Rule requiring D.\xc2\xa0C. bar applicants to have graduated from an accredited law school.  Recalling <em>Rooker</em>, this Court observed that the District Court lacked authority to review a final judicial determination of the D.\xc2\xa0C. high court because such review \xe2\x80\x9ccan be obtained only in this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U. S., at 476.  Concluding that the D.\xc2\xa0C. court\xe2\x80\x99s proceedings applying the accreditation Rule to the plaintiffs were \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial in nature,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 479\xe2\x80\x93482, this Court ruled that the Federal District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, <em>id.,</em> at 482.  However, concluding also that, in promulgating the bar admission Rule, the D.\xc2\xa0C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially, <em>id.,</em> at 485\xe2\x80\x93486, this Court held that 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 did not bar the District Court from addressing the validity of the Rule itself, so long as the plaintiffs did not seek review of the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s application in a particular case, 460 U. S., at 486.  Since <em>Feldman</em>, this Court has never applied <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.  However, the lower federal courts have variously interpreted the <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine to extend far beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker</em> and <em>Feldman</em> cases, overriding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, two subsidiaries of petitioner Exxon Mobil Corporation formed joint ventures with respondent Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) to produce polyethylene in Saudi Arabia.  When a dispute arose over royalties that SABIC had charged the joint ventures, SABIC preemptively sued the two subsidiaries in a Delaware state court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the royalties were proper.  ExxonMobil and the subsidiaries then countersued in the Federal District Court, alleging that SABIC overcharged them.  Before the state-court trial, which ultimately yielded a jury verdict of over $400 million for the ExxonMobil subsidiaries, the District Court denied SABIC\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the federal suit.  On interlocutory appeal, over eight months after the state-court jury verdict, the Third Circuit, on its own motion, raised the question whether subject-matter jurisdiction over the federal suit failed under the <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine because ExxonMobil\xe2\x80\x99s claims had already been litigated in state court.  The court did not question the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s subject-matter jurisdiction at the suit\xe2\x80\x99s outset, but held that federal jurisdiction terminated when the Delaware court entered judgment on the jury verdict.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine is confined to cases of the kind from which it acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the federal district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.  <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines allowing federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0<em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman</em> exhibit the limited circumstances in which this Court\xe2\x80\x99s appellate jurisdiction over state-court judgments, \xc2\xa71257, precludes a federal district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate under a congressional grant of authority.  In both cases, the plaintiffs, alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon the District Court to overturn an injurious state-court judgment.  Because \xc2\xa71257, as long interpreted, vests authority to review a state-court judgment solely in this Court, <em>e.g., Feldman</em>, 460 U. S., at 476, the District Courts lacked subject-matter jurisdiction, see, <em>e.g., Verizon Md. Inc.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Md., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/635/index.html">535 U. S. 635</a>, 644, n.\xc2\xa03.  When there is parallel state and federal litigation, <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> is not triggered simply by the entry of judgment in state court.  See, <em>e.g., McClellan </em>v. <em>Carland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/index.html">217 U. S. 268</a>, 282.  Comity or abstention doctrines may, in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the state-court litigation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/index.html">424 U. S. 800</a>.  But neither <em>Rooker</em> nor <em>Feldman</em> supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on the same or a related question while the case remains <em>sub judice</em> in a federal court.  Disposition of the federal action, once the state-court adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law.  Under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738, federal courts must \xe2\x80\x9cgive the same preclusive effect to a state-court judgment as another court of that State would give.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parsons Steel, Inc.</em> v. <em>First Alabama Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/518/index.html">474 U. S. 518</a>, 523.  Preclusion is not a jurisdictional matter.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa08(c).  In parallel litigation, a federal court may be bound to recognize the claim- and issue-preclusive effects of a state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate automatically on the entry of judgment in the state court.  Nor does \xc2\xa71257 stop a district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.  If a federal plaintiff presents an independent claim, even one that denies a state court\xe2\x80\x99s legal conclusion in a case to which the plaintiff was a party, there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under preclusion principles.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine does not preclude the federal court from proceeding in this case.  ExxonMobil has not repaired to federal court to undo the Delaware judgment in its favor, but appears to have filed its federal-court suit (only two weeks after SABIC filed in Delaware and well before any judgment in state court) to protect itself in the event it lost in state court on grounds (such as the state statute of limitations) that might not preclude relief in the federal venue.  <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> did not prevent the District Court from exercising jurisdiction when ExxonMobil filed the federal action, and it did not emerge to vanquish jurisdiction after ExxonMobil prevailed in the Delaware courts.  The Third Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by <em>Rooker-Feldman</em>, and consequently erred in ordering the federal action dismissed.

Variously interpreted in the lower courts, the doctrine has sometimes been construed to extend far beyond the contours of the <em>Rooker</em> and <em>Feldman</em> cases, overriding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 conferral of federal-court jurisdiction concurrent with jurisdiction exercised by state courts, and superseding the ordinary application of preclusion law pursuant to 28 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Moccio</em> v. <em>New York State Office of Court Admin.</em>, 95 F.\xc2\xa03d 195, 199\xe2\x80\x93200 (CA2 1996).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Rooker</em> was a suit commenced in Federal District Court to have a judgment of a state court, adverse to the federal court plaintiffs, \xe2\x80\x9cdeclared null and void.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 U. S., at 414.  In <em>Feldman</em>, parties unsuccessful in the District of Columbia Court of Appeals (the District\xe2\x80\x99s highest court) commenced a federal-court action against the very court that had rejected their applications.  Holding the federal suits impermissible, we emphasized that appellate jurisdiction to reverse or modify a state-court judgment is lodged, initially by \xc2\xa725 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, 1 Stat. 85, and now by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257, exclusively in this Court.  Federal district courts, we noted, are empowered to exercise original, not appellate, jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs in <em>Rooker</em> and <em>Feldman</em> had litigated and lost in state court.  Their federal complaints, we observed, essentially invited federal courts of first instance to review and reverse unfavorable state-court judgments.  We declared such suits out of bounds, <em>i.e</em>., properly dismissed for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> doctrine, we hold today, is confined to cases of the kind from which the doctrine acquired its name: cases brought by state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court judgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced and inviting district court review and rejection of those judgments.  <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> does not otherwise override or supplant preclusion doctrine or augment the circumscribed doctrines that allow federal courts to stay or dismiss proceedings in deference to state-court actions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit misperceived the narrow ground occupied by <em>Rooker-Feldman</em>, and consequently erred in ordering the federal action dismissed for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction.

This Court noted preliminarily that the state court had acted within its jurisdiction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 415.

The two plaintiffs in that case, Hickey and Feldman, neither of whom had graduated from an accredited law school, petitioned the District of Columbia Court of Appeals to waive a court Rule that required D.\xc2\xa0C. bar applicants to have graduated from a law school approved by the American Bar Association.  After the D.\xc2\xa0C. court denied their waiver requests, Hickey and Feldman filed suits in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  <em>Id.,</em> at 465\xe2\x80\x93473.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit disagreed on the question whether the federal suit could be maintained, and we granted certiorari.  <em>Id.,</em> at 474\xe2\x80\x93475.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Recalling <em>Rooker</em>, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Feldman </em>observed first that the District Court lacked authority to review a final judicial determination of the D.\xc2\xa0C. high court.  \xe2\x80\x9cReview of such determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d the <em>Feldman </em>opinion reiterated, \xe2\x80\x9ccan be obtained only in this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  460 U. S., at 476.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial question,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court next stated, was whether the proceedings in the D.\xc2\xa0C. court were \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Addressing that question, the Court concluded that the D.\xc2\xa0C. court had acted both judicially and legislatively.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In applying the accreditation Rule to the Hickey and Feldman waiver petitions, this Court determined, the D.\xc2\xa0C. court had acted judicially.  <em>Id.,</em> at 479\xe2\x80\x93482.  As to that adjudication, <em>Feldman </em>held, this Court alone among federal courts had review authority.  Hence, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that Hickey and Feldman sought review in the District Court of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 denial of their petitions for waiver, the District Court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction over their complaints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 482.  But that determination did not dispose of the entire case, for in promulgating the bar admission rule, this Court said, the D.\xc2\xa0C. court had acted legislatively, not judicially.  <em>Id.,</em> at 485\xe2\x80\x93486.  \xe2\x80\x9cChallenges to the constitutionality of state bar rules,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court elaborated, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not necessarily require a United States district court to review a final state-court judgment in a judicial proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 486.  Thus, the Court reasoned, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 did not bar District Court proceedings addressed to the validity of the accreditation Rule itself.  <em>Feldman,</em> 460 U. S., at 486.  The Rule could be contested in federal court, this Court held, so long as plaintiffs did not seek review of the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s application in a particular case.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court endeavored to separate elements of the Hickey and Feldman complaints that failed the jurisdictional threshold from those that survived jurisdictional inspection.  Plaintiffs had urged that the District of Columbia Court of Appeals acted arbitrarily in denying the waiver petitions of Hickey and Feldman, given that court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cformer policy of granting waivers to graduates of unaccredited law schools.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  That charge, the Court held, could not be pursued, for it was \xe2\x80\x9cinextricably intertwined with the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions, in judicial proceedings, to deny [plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] petitions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 486\xe2\x80\x93487.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, the Court said, plaintiffs could maintain \xe2\x80\x9cclaims that the [bar admission] rule is unconstitutional because it creates an irrebuttable presumption that only graduates of accredited law schools are fit to practice law, discriminates against those who have obtained equivalent legal training by other means, and impermissibly delegates the District of Columbia Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 power to regulate the bar to the American Bar Association,\xe2\x80\x9d for those claims \xe2\x80\x9cdo not require review of a judicial decision in a particular case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 487.  The Court left open the question whether the doctrine of res judicata foreclosed litigation of the elements of the complaints spared from dismissal for want of subject-matter jurisdiction.  <em>Id.,</em> at 487\xe2\x80\x93488.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since <em>Feldman</em>, this Court has never applied <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> to dismiss an action for want of jurisdiction.

The court rejected ExxonMobil\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> could not apply because ExxonMobil filed its federal complaint well before the state-court judgment.  The only relevant consideration, the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9cis whether the state judgment precedes a federal judgment on the same claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 105.  If <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> did not apply to federal actions filed prior to a state-court judgment, the Court of Appeals worried, \xe2\x80\x9cwe would be encouraging parties to maintain federal actions as \xe2\x80\x98insurance policies\xe2\x80\x99 while their state court claims were pending.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 105.<em> </em>Once ExxonMobil\xe2\x80\x99s claims had been litigated to a judgment in state court, the Court of Appeals held, <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> \xe2\x80\x9cpreclude[d] [the] federal district court from proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 104 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ExxonMobil, at that point prevailing in Delaware, was not seeking to overturn the state-court judgment.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257, precludes a United States district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction in an action it would otherwise be empowered to adjudicate under a congressional grant of authority, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa71330 (suits against foreign states), \xc2\xa71331 (federal question), and \xc2\xa71332 (diversity).  In both cases, the losing party in state court filed suit in federal court after the state proceedings ended, complaining of an injury caused by the state-court judgment and seeking review and rejection of that judgment.  Plaintiffs in both cases, alleging federal-question jurisdiction, called upon the District Court to overturn an injurious state-court judgment.  Because \xc2\xa71257, as long interpreted, vests authority to review a state court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment solely in this Court, <em>e.g., Feldman</em>, 460 U. S., at 476;<em> Atlantic Coast Line R. Co.</em> v. <em>Locomotive Engineers,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/281/index.html">398 U. S. 281</a>, 286 (1970); <em>Rooker</em>, 263 U. S., at 416, the District Courts in <em>Rooker </em>and <em>Feldman </em>lacked subject-matter jurisdiction.  See <em>Verizon Md. Inc.,</em> 535 U. S., at 644, n.\xc2\xa03 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Rooker-Feldman </em>doctrine merely recognizes that 28 U.

This Court has repeatedly held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe pendency of an action in the state court is no bar to proceedings concerning the same matter in the Federal court having jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McClellan </em>v. <em>Carland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/268/index.html">217 U.

S., at 295.  Comity or abstention doctrines may, in various circumstances, permit or require the federal court to stay or dismiss the federal action in favor of the state-court litigation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Colorado River Water Conservation Dist.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/800/index.html">424 U. S. 800</a> (1976); <em>Younger</em> v. <em>Harris,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/37/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/37/index.html">401 U.

But neither <em>Rooker</em> nor <em>Feldman</em> supports the notion that properly invoked concurrent jurisdiction vanishes if a state court reaches judgment on the same or related question while the case remains <em>sub judice</em> in a federal court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Disposition of the federal action, once the state-court adjudication is complete, would be governed by preclusion law.  The Full Faith and Credit Act, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71738, originally enacted in 1790, ch. 11, 1 Stat. 122, requires the federal court to \xe2\x80\x9cgive the same preclusive effect to a state-court judgment as another court of that State would give.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parsons Steel, Inc.</em> v. <em>First Alabama Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/518/index.html">474 U. S. 518</a>, 523 (1986); accord <em>Matsushita Elec. Industrial Co.</em> v. <em>Epstein,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/367/index.html">516 U.

Preclusion, of course, is not a jurisdictional matter.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 8(c) (listing res judicata as an affirmative defense).  In parallel litigation, a federal court may be bound to recognize the claim- and issue-preclusive effects of a state-court judgment, but federal jurisdiction over an action does not terminate automatically on the entry of judgment in the state court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does \xc2\xa71257 stop a district court from exercising subject-matter jurisdiction simply because a party attempts to litigate in federal court a matter previously litigated in state court.  If a federal plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9cpresent[s] some independent claim, albeit one that denies a legal conclusion that a state court has reached in a case to which he was a party \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, then there is jurisdiction and state law determines whether the defendant prevails under principles of preclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>GASH Assocs. </em>v. <em>Village of Rosemont</em>, 995 F.\xc2\xa02d 726, 728 (CA7 1993); accord <em>Noel</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, 341 F.\xc2\xa03d 1148, 1163\xe2\x80\x931164 (CA9 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case surely is not the \xe2\x80\x9cparadigm situation in which <em>Rooker-Feldman</em> precludes a federal district court from proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  364 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 104 (quoting <em>E.\xc2\xa0B.</em> v. <em>Verniero</em>, 119 F.\xc2\xa03d 1077, 1090\xe2\x80\x931091 (CA3 1997)).  ExxonMobil plainly has not repaired to federal court to undo the Delaware judgment in its favor.  Rather, it appears ExxonMobil filed suit in Federal District Court (only two weeks after SABIC filed in Delaware and well before any judgment in state court) to protect itself in the event it lost in state court on grounds (such as the state statute of limitations) that might not preclude relief in the federal venue.

The injury of which the petitioners (the losing parties in state court) could have complained in the hypothetical federal suit would have been caused by the state court\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation of their mineral leases, and the relief they would have sought would have been to undo the state court\xe2\x80\x99s invalidation of the statute.
