The District Judge refused to do so upon petitioner\'s representation in his belated brief and in open court that the delay was due to illness on his part. The court went on to hear the case on its merits and, after a trial which lasted only an hour, rendered judgment for the Government.

Nevertheless, the Court of Appeals refused to reverse this illegal conviction and dismissed petitioner\'s appeal on the ground that, while he gave an oral notice of appeal and filed an appeal bond at the end of his trial, he did not file a written notice of appeal within the 10-day period specified by Fed.Rule Crim.Proc. 37(a)(2). Although only four days after that period expired petitioner moved the trial court to accept a written notice of appeal, and although the trial court then found that petitioner\'s delay was the result of excusable neglect,\' the Court of Appeals refused to hold the oral notice adequate. The court noted that the result might be different had this case arisen under the 1966 amendment to Rule 37(a)(2) which now provides that \'upon a showing of excusable neglect, the district court may, before or after the time has expired, ... extend the time for filing the notice of appeal otherwise allowed to <font color="#005500" size="-1"><a name="963">[386 U.S. 961 , 963]</a> <br/><br/><br/>\n</font></p></span></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n</font></div><font color="#005500" size="-1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1946623">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<span class="headertext"><h2>U.S. Supreme Court</h2><h3> TEMPLE v.
