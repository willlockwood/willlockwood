GOLDSTEIN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">VAN de KAMP et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. GOLDSTEIN</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93854.\xe2\x80\x83Argued November 5, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided January 26, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent Goldstein was released from a California prison after he filed a successful federal habeas petition alleging that his murder conviction depended, in critical part, on the false testimony of a jailhouse informant (Fink), who had received reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that prosecutors knew, but failed to give his attorney, this potential impeachment information; and that, among other things, that failure had led to his erroneous conviction.  Once released, Goldstein filed this suit under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, asserting the prosecution violated its constitutional duty to communicate impeachment information, see <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a>, 154, due to the failure of petitioners, supervisory prosecutors, to properly train or supervise prosecutors or to establish an information system containing potential impeachment material about informants.  Claiming absolute immunity, petitioners asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint, but the court declined, finding that the conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutorial,\xe2\x80\x9d and hence fell outside the scope of an absolute immunity claim.  The Ninth Circuit, on interlocutory appeal, affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s supervision, training, and information-system management claims.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in \xc2\xa71983 suits brought against prosecutorial actions that are \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Imbler</em> v. <em>Pachtman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/index.html">424 U. S. 409</a>, 428, 430, because of \xe2\x80\x9cconcern that harassment by unfounded litigation\xe2\x80\x9d could both \xe2\x80\x9ccause a deflection of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s energies from his public duties\xe2\x80\x9d and lead him to \xe2\x80\x9cshade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 423.  However, absolute immunity may not apply when a prosecutor is not acting as \xe2\x80\x9can officer of the court,\xe2\x80\x9d but is instead engaged in, say, investigative or administrative tasks.  <em>Id.</em>, at 431, n. 33.  To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular prosecutorial activity, one must take account of <em>Imbler</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional\xe2\x80\x9d considerations.  The fact that one constitutional duty in <em>Imbler</em> was positive (the duty to supply \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relevant to the defense\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than negative (the duty not to \xe2\x80\x9cuse \xe2\x80\xa6 perjured testimony\xe2\x80\x9d) was not critical to the finding of absolute immunity.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although Goldstein challenges administrative procedures, they are procedures that are directly connected with a trial\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  A prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s error in a specific criminal trial constitutes an essential element of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The obligations here are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, <em>e.g.,</em> workplace hiring.  Moreover, they necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion, <em>e.g.</em>, in determining what information should be included in training, supervision, or information-system management.  Given these features, absolute immunity must follow.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0Had Goldstein brought a suit directly attacking supervisory prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 actions related to an individual trial, instead of one involving administration, all the prosecutors would have enjoyed absolute immunity under <em>Imbler.  </em>Their behavior, individually or separately, would have involved \xe2\x80\x9c[p]reparation \xe2\x80\xa6 for \xe2\x80\xa6 trial,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 431, n. 33, and would have been \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 430.  The only difference between <em>Imbler </em>and the hypothetical, <em>i.e.,</em> that a supervisor or colleague might be liable <em>instead of</em> the trial prosecutor, is not critical.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Just as supervisory prosecutors are immune in a suit directly attacking their actions in an individual trial, they are immune here.  The fact that the office\xe2\x80\x99s <em>general</em> supervision and training methods are at issue is not a critical difference for present purposes.  The relevant management tasks concern how and when to make impeachment information available at trial, and, thus, are directly connected with a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s basic trial advocacy duties.  In terms of <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>functional concerns, a suit claiming that a supervisor made a mistake directly related to a particular trial and one claiming that a supervisor trained and supervised inadequately seem very much alike.  The type of \xe2\x80\x9cfaulty training\xe2\x80\x9d claim here rests in part on a consequent error by an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial.  If, as <em>Imbler </em>says, the threat of damages liability for such an error could lead a trial prosecutor to take account of that risk when making trial-related decisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread liability throughout the office lead both that prosecutor and other office prosecutors to take account of such a risk.  Because better training or supervision might prevent most prosecutorial errors at trial, permission to bring suit here would grant criminal defendants permission to bring claims for other trial-related training or supervisory failings.  Further, such suits could \xe2\x80\x9cpose substantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Imbler</em>, 425 U. S.,<em> </em>at 425.  And defending prosecutorial decisions, often years later, could impose \xe2\x80\x9cunique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.  Permitting this suit to go forward would also create practical anomalies.  A trial prosecutor would remain immune for intentional misconduct, while her supervisor might be liable for negligent training or supervision.  And the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charging trial failure to one charging a training or supervision failure would eviscerate <em>Imbler. </em> Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The differences between an information management system and training or supervision do not require a different outcome, for the critical element of any information system is the information it contains.  Deciding what to include and what not to include is little different from making similar decisions regarding training, for it requires knowledge of the law.  Moreover, were this claim allowed, a court would have to review the office\xe2\x80\x99s legal judgments, not simply about <em>whether </em>to have an information system but also about <em>what kind </em>of system is appropriate, and whether an appropriate system would have included <em>Giglio-</em>related information <em>about one particular kind of informant</em>.  Such decisions\xe2\x80\x94whether made before or during trial\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Imbler</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 430,<em> </em>and all <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s functional considerations apply.

Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  See <em>Imbler</em> v. <em>Pachtman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/409/index.html">424 U. S. 409</a> (1976).  We ask whether that immunity extends to claims that the prosecution failed to disclose impeachment material, see <em>Giglio</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a> (1972), due to: (1) a failure properly to train prosecutors, (2) a failure properly to supervise prosecutors, or (3) a failure to establish an information system containing potential impeachment material about informants.  We conclude that a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s absolute immunity extends to all these claims.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1998, respondent Thomas Goldstein (then a prisoner) filed a habeas corpus action in the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.  He claimed that in 1980 he was convicted of murder; that his conviction depended in critical part upon the testimony of Edward Floyd Fink, a jailhouse informant; that Fink\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was unreliable, indeed false; that Fink had previously received reduced sentences for providing prosecutors with favorable testimony in other cases; that at least some prosecutors in the Los Angeles County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office knew about the favorable treatment; that the office had not provided Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s attorney with that information; and that, among other things, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s attorney with this potential impeachment information had led to his erroneous conviction.  <em>Goldstein </em>v. <em>Long Beach</em>, 481 F.\xc2\xa03d 1170, 1171\xe2\x80\x931172 (CA9 2007).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After an evidentiary hearing the District Court agreed with Goldstein that Fink had not been truthful and that if the prosecution had told Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer that Fink had received prior rewards in return for favorable testimony it might have made a difference.  The court ordered the State either to grant Goldstein a new trial or to release him.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  And the State decided that, rather than retry Goldstein (who had already served 24 years of his sentence), it would release him.  App. 54\xe2\x80\x9355, 59\xe2\x80\x9360.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Upon his release Goldstein filed this \xc2\xa71983 action against petitioners, the former Los Angeles County district attorney and chief deputy district attorney.  Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s complaint (which for present purposes we take as accurate) asserts in relevant part that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s failure to communicate to his attorney the facts about Fink\xe2\x80\x99s earlier testimony-related rewards violated the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional duty to \xe2\x80\x9cinsure communication of all relevant information on each case [including agreements made with informants] to every lawyer who deals with it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Giglio</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 154.  Moreover, it alleges that this failure resulted from the failure of petitioners (the office\xe2\x80\x99s chief supervisory attorneys) adequately to train and to supervise the prosecutors who worked for them as well as their failure to establish an information system about informants.  And it asks for damages based upon these training, supervision, and information-system related failings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners, claiming absolute immunity from such a \xc2\xa71983 action, asked the District Court to dismiss the complaint.  See <em>Imbler,</em> <em>supra.</em>  The District Court denied the motion to dismiss on the ground that the conduct asserted amounted to \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutorial,\xe2\x80\x9d conduct; hence it fell outside the scope of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s absolute immunity to \xc2\xa71983 claims.  The Ninth Circuit, considering petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim on an interlocutory appeal, affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cno immunity\xe2\x80\x9d determination.  We now review the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and we reverse its determination.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A half-century ago Chief Judge Learned Hand explained that a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s absolute immunity reflects \xe2\x80\x9ca balance\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cevils.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gregoire </em>v. <em>Biddle</em>, 177 F.\xc2\xa02d 579, 581 (CA2 1949).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t has been thought in the end better,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cto leave unredressed the wrongs done by dishonest officers than to subject those who try to do their duty to the constant dread of retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Imbler, supra</em>, this Court considered prosecutorial actions that are \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 430.  And, referring to Chief Judge Hand\xe2\x80\x99s views, it held that prosecutors are absolutely immune from liability in \xc2\xa71983 lawsuits brought under such circumstances.  <em>Id.</em>, at 428.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xc2\xa71983 action at issue was that of a prisoner freed on a writ of habeas corpus who subsequently sought damages from his former prosecutor.  His action, like the action now before us, tracked the claims that a federal court had found valid when granting his habeas corpus petition.  In particular, the prisoner claimed that the trial prosecutor had permitted a fingerprint expert to give false testimony, that the prosecutor was responsible for the expert\xe2\x80\x99s having suppressed important evidence, and that the prosecutor had introduced a misleading artist\xe2\x80\x99s sketch into evidence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 416.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that the prosecutor was absolutely immune, the Court pointed out that legislators have long \xe2\x80\x9cenjoyed absolute immunity for their official actions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 417; that the common law granted immunity to \xe2\x80\x9cjudges and \xe2\x80\xa6 jurors acting within the scope of their duties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 423, and that the law had also granted prosecutors absolute immunity from common-law tort actions, say, those underlying a \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to initiate a prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 421.  The Court then held that the \xe2\x80\x9csame considerations of public policy that underlie\xe2\x80\x9d a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s common-law immunity \xe2\x80\x9ccountenance absolute immunity under \xc2\xa71983.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 424.  Those considerations, the Court said, arise out of the general common-law \xe2\x80\x9cconcern that harassment by unfounded litigation\xe2\x80\x9d could both \xe2\x80\x9ccause a deflection of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s energies from his public duties\xe2\x80\x9d and also lead the prosecutor to \xe2\x80\x9cshade his decisions instead of exercising the independence of judgment required by his public trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 423.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where \xc2\xa71983 actions are at issue, the Court said, both sets of concerns are present and serious.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpublic trust of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s office would suffer\xe2\x80\x9d were the prosecutor to have in mind his \xe2\x80\x9cown potential\xe2\x80\x9d damages \xe2\x80\x9cliability\xe2\x80\x9d when making prosecutorial decisions\xe2\x80\x94as he might well were he subject to \xc2\xa71983 liability.  <em>Id.</em>, at 424.  This is no small concern, given the frequency with which criminal defendants bring such suits, <em>id.</em>, at 425 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant often will transform his resentment at being prosecuted into the ascription of improper and malicious actions to the State\xe2\x80\x99s advocate\xe2\x80\x9d), and the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor\xe2\x80\x9d that such suits pose when they survive pretrial dismissal, <em>ibid.;</em> see also <em>ibid.</em> (complex, close, fair-trial questions \xe2\x80\x9coften would require a virtual retrial of the criminal offense in a new forum, and the resolution of some technical issues by the lay jury\xe2\x80\x9d).  A \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutor,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court noted, \xe2\x80\x9cinevitably makes many decisions that could engender colorable claims of constitutional deprivation.  Defending these decisions, often years after they were made, could impose unique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.  The Court thus rejected the idea of applying the less-than-absolute \xe2\x80\x9cqualified immunity\xe2\x80\x9d that the law accords to other \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive or administrative officials,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that the \xe2\x80\x9chonest prosecutor would face greater difficulty\xe2\x80\x9d than would those officials \xe2\x80\x9cin meeting the standards of qualified immunity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 425.  Accordingly, the immunity that the law grants prosecutors is \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 424.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court made clear that absolute immunity may not apply when a prosecutor is not acting as \xe2\x80\x9can officer of the court,\xe2\x80\x9d but is instead engaged in other tasks, say, investigative or administrative tasks.  <em>Id.</em>, at 431, n. 33.  To decide whether absolute immunity attaches to a particular kind of prosecutorial activity, one must take account of the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional\xe2\x80\x9d considerations discussed above.  See <em>Burns</em> v. <em>Reed</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/478/index.html">500 U. S. 478</a>, 486 (1991) (collecting cases applying \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional approach\xe2\x80\x9d to immunity); <em>Kalina</em> v. <em>Fletcher</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/118/index.html">522 U. S. 118</a>, 127, 130 (1997).  In <em>Imbler</em>, the Court concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9creasons for absolute immunity appl[ied] with full force\xe2\x80\x9d to the conduct at issue because it was \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U. S., at 430.  The fact that one constitutional duty at issue was a positive duty (the duty to supply \xe2\x80\x9cinformation relevant to the defense\xe2\x80\x9d) rather than a negative duty (the duty not to \xe2\x80\x9cuse \xe2\x80\xa6 perjured testimony\xe2\x80\x9d) made no difference.  After all, a plaintiff can often transform a positive into a negative duty simply by reframing the pleadings; in either case, a constitutional violation is at issue.  <em>Id.</em>, at 431,  n.\xc2\xa034.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court specifically reserved the question whether or when \xe2\x80\x9csimilar reasons require immunity for those aspects of the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility that cast him in the role of an administrator \xe2\x80\xa6 rather than that of advocate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 430\xe2\x80\x93431.  It said that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]rawing a proper line between these functions may present difficult questions, but this case does not require us to anticipate them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 431, n.\xc2\xa033.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the years since <em>Imbler</em>, we have held that absolute immunity applies when a prosecutor prepares to initiate a judicial proceeding, <em>Burns, supra,</em> at 492,<em> </em>or appears in court to present evidence in support of a search warrant application, <em>Kalina</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 126.  We have held that absolute immunity does not apply when a prosecutor gives advice to police during a criminal investigation, see <em>Burns</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 496, when the prosecutor makes statements to the press, <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Fitzsimmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/259/index.html">509 U. S. 259</a>, 277 (1993), or when a prosecutor acts as a complaining witness in support of a warrant application, <em>Kalina</em>, <em>supra,</em> at\n132  (Scalia,\xc2\xa0J., concurring).  This case, unlike these earlier cases, requires us to consider how immunity applies where a prosecutor is engaged in certain administrative activities.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Goldstein claims that the district attorney and his chief assistant violated their constitutional obligation to provide his attorney with impeachment-related information, see <em>Giglio, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/150/index.html"></a><a href="/us/405/150/index.html">405 U. S. 150</a>,<em> </em>because, as the Court of Appeals wrote, they failed \xe2\x80\x9cto adequately train and supervise deputy district attorneys on that subject,\xe2\x80\x9d 481 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1176, and because, as Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s complaint adds, they \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to create any system for the Deputy District Attorneys handling criminal cases to access information pertaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants and other impeachment information.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 45.  We agree with Goldstein that, in making these claims, he attacks the office\xe2\x80\x99s administrative procedures.  We are also willing to assume with Goldstein, but purely for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake, that <em>Giglio </em>imposes certain obligations as to training, supervision, or information-system management.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even so, we conclude that prosecutors involved in such supervision or training or information-system management enjoy absolute immunity from the kind of legal claims at issue here.  Those claims focus upon a certain kind of administrative obligation\xe2\x80\x94a kind that itself is directly connected with the conduct of a trial.  Here, unlike with other claims related to administrative decisions, an individual prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s error in the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s specific criminal trial constitutes an essential element of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The administrative obligations at issue here are thus unlike administrative duties concerning, for example, workplace hiring, payroll administration, the maintenance of physical facilities, and the like.  Moreover, the types of activities on which Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s claims focus necessarily require legal knowledge and the exercise of related discretion, <em>e.g.</em>, in determining what information should be included in the training or the supervision or the information-system management.  And in that sense also Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s claims are unlike claims of, say, unlawful discrimination in hiring employees.  Given these features of the case before us, we believe absolute immunity must follow.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reach this conclusion by initially considering a hypothetical case that involves supervisory or other office prosecutors but does not involve administration.  Suppose that Goldstein had brought such a case, seeking damages not only from the trial prosecutor but also from a supervisory prosecutor or from the trial prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s colleagues\xe2\x80\x94all on the ground that they should have found and turned over the impeachment material about Fink.  <em>Imbler </em>makes clear that all these prosecutors would enjoy absolute immunity from such a suit.  The prosecutors\xe2\x80\x99 behavior, taken individually or separately, would involve \xe2\x80\x9c[p]reparation \xe2\x80\xa6 for \xe2\x80\xa6 trial,\xe2\x80\x9d 424 U. S., at 431, n.\xc2\xa033, and would be \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process\xe2\x80\x9d because it concerned the evidence presented at trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 430.  And all of the considerations that this Court found to militate in favor of absolute immunity in <em>Imbler </em>would militate in favor of immunity in such a case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only difference we can find between <em>Imbler </em>and our hypothetical case lies in the fact that, in our hypothetical case, a prosecutorial supervisor or colleague might himself be liable for damages <em>instead of</em> the trial prosecutor.  But we cannot find that difference (in the pattern of liability among prosecutors within a single office) to be critical.  Decisions about indictment or trial prosecution will often involve more than one prosecutor within an office.  We do not see how such differences in the pattern of liability among a group of prosecutors in a single office could alleviate <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>basic fear, namely, that the threat of damages liability would affect the way in which prosecutors carried out their basic court-related tasks.  Moreover, this Court has pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the interest in protecting the proper functioning of the office, rather than the interest in protecting its occupant, that is of primary importance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kalina</em>, 522 U. S., at 125.  Thus, we must assume that the prosecutors in our hypothetical suit would enjoy absolute immunity.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once we determine that supervisory prosecutors are immune in a suit directly attacking their actions related to an individual trial, we must find they are similarly immune in the case before us.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the office\xe2\x80\x99s <em>general</em> methods of supervision and training are at issue here, but we do not agree that that difference is critical for present purposes.  That difference does not preclude an intimate connection between prosecutorial activity and the trial process.  The management tasks at issue, insofar as they are relevant, concern how and when to make impeachment information available at a trial.  They are thereby directly connected with the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s basic trial advocacy duties.  And, in terms of <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>functional concerns, a suit charging that a supervisor made a mistake directly related to a particular trial, on the one hand, and a suit charging that a supervisor trained and supervised inadequately, on the other, would seem very much alike.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is true, in part, for the practical reason that it will often prove difficult to draw a line between <em>general </em>office supervision or office training (say, related to <em>Giglio</em>) and <em>specific </em>supervision or training related to a particular case.  To permit claims based upon the former is almost inevitably to permit the bringing of claims that include the latter.  It is also true because one cannot easily distinguish, for immunity purposes, between claims based upon training or supervisory failures related to <em>Giglio </em>and similar claims related to other constitutional matters (obligations under <em>Brady</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/83/index.html">373 U. S. 83</a> (1963), for example).  And that being so, every consideration that <em>Imbler </em>mentions militates in favor of immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said, the type of \xe2\x80\x9cfaulty training\xe2\x80\x9d claim at issue here rests in necessary part upon a consequent error by an individual prosecutor in the midst of trial, namely, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  If, as <em>Imbler </em>says, the threat of damages liability for such an error could lead a trial prosecutor to take account of that risk when making trial-related decisions, so, too, could the threat of more widespread liability throughout the office (ultimately traceable to that trial error) lead both that prosecutor and other office prosecutors as well to take account of such a risk.  Indeed, members of a large prosecutorial office, when making prosecutorial decisions, could have in mind the \xe2\x80\x9cconsequences in terms of\xe2\x80\x9d damages liability whether they are making general decisions about supervising or training or whether they are making individual trial-related decisions.  <em>Imbler,</em> 424 U. S., at 424.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, because better training or supervision might prevent most, if not all, prosecutorial errors at trial, permission to bring such a suit here would grant permission to criminal defendants to bring claims in other similar instances, in effect claiming damages for (trial-related) training or supervisory failings.  Cf.<em> Imbler</em>, <em>supra</em>.  Further, given the complexity of the constitutional issues, inadequate training and supervision suits could, as in <em>Imbler</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cpose substantial danger of liability even to the honest prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 425.  Finally, as <em>Imbler </em>pointed out, defending prosecutorial decisions, often years after they were made, could impose \xe2\x80\x9cunique and intolerable burdens upon a prosecutor responsible annually for hundreds of indictments and trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 425\xe2\x80\x93426.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, to permit this suit to go forward would create practical anomalies.  A trial prosecutor would remain immune, even for <em>intentionally</em> failing to turn over, say <em>Giglio </em>material; but her supervisor might be liable for <em>negligent </em>training or supervision.  Small prosecution offices where supervisors can personally participate in all of the cases would likewise remain immune from prosecution; but large offices, making use of more general office-wide supervision and training, would not.  Most important, the ease with which a plaintiff could restyle a complaint charging a trial failure so that it becomes a complaint charging a failure of training or supervision would eviscerate <em>Imbler.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the very reasons that led this Court in <em>Imbler </em>to find absolute immunity require a similar finding in this case.  We recognize, as Chief Judge Hand pointed out, that sometimes such immunity deprives a plaintiff of compensation that he undoubtedly merits; but the impediments to the fair, efficient functioning of a prosecutorial office that liability could create lead us to find that <em>Imbler </em>must apply here.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We treat separately Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the Los Angeles County District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office should have established a system that would have permitted prosecutors \xe2\x80\x9chandling criminal cases to access information pertaining to the benefits provided to jailhouse informants and other impeachment information.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 45.  We do so because Goldstein argues that the creation of an information management system is a more purely administrative task, less closely related to the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial phase of the criminal process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Imbler</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 430, than are supervisory or training tasks.  He adds that technically qualified individuals other than prosecutors could create such a system and that they could do so prior to the initiation of criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, however, these differences do not require a different outcome.  The critical element of any information system is the information it contains.  Deciding what to include and what not to include in an information system is little different from making similar decisions in respect to training.  Again, determining the criteria for inclusion or exclusion requires knowledge of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the absence of an information system is relevant here if, and only if, a proper system would have included information about the informant Fink.  Thus, were this claim allowed, a court would have to review the office\xe2\x80\x99s legal judgments, not simply about <em>whether </em>to have an information system but also about <em>what kind </em>of system is appropriate, and whether an appropriate system would have included <em>Giglio-</em>related information <em>about one particular kind of trial informant</em>.  Such decisions\xe2\x80\x94whether made prior to or during a particular trial\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9cintimately associated with the judicial phase of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Imbler</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 430<em>; </em>see<em> Burns</em>, 500 U. S., at 486.  And, for the reasons set out above, all <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s functional considerations (and the anomalies we mentioned earlier, <em>supra</em>, at 10) apply here as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We recognize that sometimes it would be easy for a court to determine that an office\xe2\x80\x99s decision about an information system was inadequate.  Suppose, for example, the office had no system at all.  But the same could be said of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s trial error.  Immunity does not exist to help prosecutors in the easy case; it exists because the easy cases bring difficult cases in their wake.  And, as <em>Imbler </em>pointed out, the likely presence of too many difficult cases threatens, not prosecutors, but the public, for the reason that it threatens to undermine the necessary independence and integrity of the prosecutorial decision-making process.  Such is true of the kinds of claims before us, to all of which <em>Imbler\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>functional considerations apply.  Consequently, where a \xc2\xa71983 plaintiff claims that a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s management of a trial-related information system is responsible for a constitutional error at his or her particular trial, the prosecutor responsible for the system enjoys absolute immunity just as would the prosecutor who handled the particular trial itself.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons we conclude that petitioners are entitled to absolute immunity in respect to Goldstein\xe2\x80\x99s claims that their supervision, training, or information-system management was constitutionally inadequate.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
