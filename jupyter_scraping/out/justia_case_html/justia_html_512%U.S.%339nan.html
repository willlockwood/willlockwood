Petitioner Reed was transferred in April 1983 from a federal prison in Indiana to state custody pursuant to an lAD detainer lodged by Indiana officials. Trial on the state charges was originally set for a date 19 days beyond the 120-day lAD period and was subsequently postponed for an additional 35 days. Although Reed\'s many and wide-ranging pretrial motions contained a few general references to the lAD time limit, he did not specifically object to his trial date until four days after the 120-day period expired. The trial court denied Reed\'s petition for discharge on the grounds that the judge had previously been unaware of the 120-day limitation and that Reed had not earlier objected to the trial date or requested a speedier trial. Reed then successfully moved for a continuance to enable him to prepare his defense. Mter his trial and conviction in October 1983, Reed unsuccesfully pursued an appeal and sought postconviction relief in Indiana\'s courts.

S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2, is a compact among 48 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government. It enables a participating State to gain custody of a prisoner incarcerated in another jurisdiction, in order to try him on criminal charges. Article IV(c) of the lAD provides that trial of a transferred prisoner "shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty days of the arrival of the prisoner in the receiving State, but for good cause shown in open court, ... the court</p><p>*Solicitor General Days, Assistant Attorney General Harris, Depnty Solicitor General Bryson, and Richard H. Seamon filed a brief for the United States as amicus curiae urging affirmance.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="342">342</a></p><p>having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance." lAD Article V(c) states that when trial does not occur within the time prescribed, the charges shall be dismissed with prejudice.</p><p>The petitioner in this case, Orrin Scott Reed, was transferred in April 1983 from a federal prison in Indiana to state custody pursuant to an lAD request made by Indiana officials. Reed was tried in October of that year, following postponements made and explained in his presence in open court. Reed\'s petition raises the question whether a state prisoner, asserting a violation of lAD Article IV(c)\'s 120-day limitation, may enforce that speedy trial prescription in a federal habeas corpus action under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254.</p><p>We hold that a state court\'s failure to observe the 120-day rule of lAD Article IV(c) is not cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2254 when the defendant registered no objection to the trial date at the time it was set, and suffered no prejudice attributable to the delayed commencement. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>In December 1982, while petitioner Reed was serving time in a Terre Haute, Indiana, federal prison, the State of Indiana charged him with theft and habitual offender status. Indiana authorities lodged a detainer 1 against Reed and, on April 27, 1983, took custody of him. The 120-day rule of lAD Article IV(c) thus instructed that, absent any continuance, Reed\'s trial was to commence on or before August 25,1983.</p><p>At two pretrial conferences, one on June 27, the other on August 1, the trial judge discussed with Reed (who chose to represent himself) and the prosecutor the number of days needed for the trial and the opening date. At the June 27</p><p>1 A detainer is "a request filed by a criminal justice agency with the institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking ... either to hold the prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent." <i>Carchman </i>v. <i>Nash, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/716/case.html">473 U. S. 716</a>, 719 (1985).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="343">343</a></p><p>conference, the court set a July 18 deadline for submission of the many threshold motions Reed said he wished to file, and September 13 as the trial date. That trial date exceeded lAD Article IV(c)\'s 120-day limit, but neither the prosecutor nor Reed called the lAD limit to the attention of the judge, and neither asked for a different trial date. Reed did indicate a preference for trial at a time when he would be out of jail on bond (or on his own recognizance); he informed the court that he would be released from federal custody two weeks before September 13, unless federal authorities revoked his "good days" credits, in which case he would be paroled on September 14. App. 39; see id., at 76.</p><p>At the August 1 pretrial conference, Reed noted his imminent release from federal custody and asked the court to set bond. <i>Id., </i>at 76-79. In response, the court set bond at $25,000. Also, because of a calendar conflict, the court reset the trial date to September 19. <i>Id., </i>at 79-81.2 Reed inquired about witness subpoenas and requested books on procedure, but again, he said nothing at the conference to alert the judge to Article IV(c)\'s 120-day limit, nor did he express any other objection to the September 19 trial date.</p><p>Interspersed in Reed\'s many written and oral pretrial motions are references to lAD provisions other than Article IV(c). See id., at 28-31, 44 (alleging illegality of transfer from federal to state custody without a pretransfer hearing); id., at 46 (asserting failure to provide hygienic care in violation of lAD Article V). Reed did refer to the lAD prescription on trial commencement in three of the written motions he filed during the 120-day period; indeed, one of these motions was filed on the very day of the August 1 pretrial conference.3 In none of the three motions, however, did Reed</p><p>2 Reed posted bond by corporate surety on September 28 and was thereupon released from pretrial incarceration. See App. 148.</p><p>3 See Petition for Relief of Violations (filed July 25, 1983), id., at 56 (requesting that "trial be held within the legal guidelines of the [lAD]" and asserting that the State was "forcing [him] to be tried beyond the limits</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="344">344</a></p><p>mention Article IV(c) or the September 13 trial date previously set. In contrast, on August 29, four days after the 120-day period expired, Reed presented a clear statement and citation. In a "Petition for Discharge," he alleged that Indiana had failed to try him within 120 days of his transfer to state custody, and therefore had violated Article IV(c); 4 consequently, he urged, the lAD mandated his immediate release.5 The trial judge denied the petition, explaining:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Today is the first day I was aware that there was a 120 day limitation on the Detainer Act. The Court made its setting and while there has been a request for moving the trial forward, there has not been any speedy trial request filed, nor has there been anything in the nature of an objection to the trial setting, but only an urging that it be done within the guidelines that have been set out." <i>Id., </i>at 113-114.</p></blockquote><p>The morning trial was to commence, September 19, Reed filed a motion for continuance, saying he needed additional time for trial preparation. <i>Id., </i>at 128. A newspaper article published two days earlier had listed the names of persons</p><p>as set forth in the [lAD]"); Petition for Revision of Pre-trial Procedure and Relief of Violations (filed Aug. 1, 1983), id., at 88 (seeking dismissal of charges, referring, <i>inter alia, </i>to "the limited time left for trial within the laws"); Petition for Subpoena for Depositions upon Oral Examination, and for Production of Documentary Evidence (filed Aug. 11, 1983), id., at 91 (requesting action "as soon as possible due to approaching trial date and Detainer Act time limits").</p><p>4 <i>Id., </i>at 94. Specifically, Reed wrote: "That petitioner is being detained contrary to Indiana law and procedure: 35-33-10-4, Article 4(c) ... trial shall be commenced within one hundred twenty (120) days of arrival of the prisoner in the receiving state .... "</p><p>5 The prosecutor, in response, pointed out that Article IV(c) permits "any necessary or reasonable continuance," and that Reed had not objected at the time the trial court set the date. <i>Id., </i>at 113. He also expressed confusion about the effect of the 120-day rule and its relationship to the 180-day time limit prescribed by a different lAD provision. <i>Id., </i>at 114; see n. 6, <i>infra.</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="345">345</a></p><p>called for jury duty and the 1954 to 1980 time frame of Reed\'s alleged prior felony convictions. Concerned that the article might jeopardize the fairness of the trial, the judge offered Reed three options: (1) start the trial on schedule; (2) postpone it for one week; or (3) continue it to a late October date. Reed chose the third option, id., at 134, 142, and the trial began on October 18; the jury convicted Reed of theft, and found him a habitual offender. He received a sentence of 4 years in prison on the theft conviction, and 30 years on the habitual offender conviction, the terms to run consecutively.</p><p>The Indiana Supreme Court affirmed the convictions.</p><p><i>Reed </i>v. <i>State, </i>491 N. E. 2d 182 (1986). Concerning Reed\'s objection that the trial commenced after the 120-day period specified in lAD Article IV(c), the Indiana Supreme Court stressed the timing of Reed\'s pleas in court: Reed had vigorously urged at the August 1 pretrial conference other alleged lAD violations (particularly, his asserted right to a hearing in advance of the federal transfer to state custody), but he did not then object to the trial date. <i>Id., </i>at 184-185; see App. 67-74. "The relevant times when [Reed] should have objected were on June 27, 1983, the date the trial was set, and August 1, 1983, the date the trial was reset," the Indiana Supreme Court concluded. 491 N. E. 2d, at 185.</p><p>Reed unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Indiana courts, and then petitioned under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254 for a federal writ of habeas corpus. The District Court denied the petition. Examining the record, that court concluded that "a significant amount of the delay of trial is attributable to the many motions filed ... by [Reed] or filed on [Reed\'s] behalf"; delay chargeable to Reed, the court held, was excludable from the 120-day period. <i>Reed </i>v. <i>Clark, </i>Civ. No. S 90-226 (ND Ind., Sept. 21, 1990), App. 195-196.</p><p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed.</p><p><i>Reed </i>v. <i>Clark, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/984/209/">984 F.2d 209</a> (1993). Preliminarily, the Court of Appeals recognized that the lAD, although state law, is also a "law of the United States" within the meaning of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="346">346</a></p><p>\xc2\xa7 2254(a). <i>Id., </i>at 210. Nonetheless, that court held collateral relief unavailable because Reed\'s lAD speedy trial arguments and remedial contentions had been considered and rejected by the Indiana courts. <i>Stone </i>v. <i>Powell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a> (1976), the Court of Appeals concluded, "establishes the proper framework for evaluating claims under the lAD." 984 F. 2d, at 213. In <i>Stone, </i>this Court held that the exclusionary rule, devised to promote police respect for the Fourth Amendment rights of suspects, should not be applied on collateral review unless the state court failed to consider the defendant\'s arguments. We granted certiorari, 510 U. s. 963 (1993), to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals on the availability of habeas review of lAD speedy trial claims.6</p><p>6 The lAD\'s other speedy trial provision, Article III (a), requires that a prisoner against whom a detainer has been lodged be tried within 180 days of the prosecuting State\'s receipt of the prisoner\'s notice requesting speedy disposition of the charges. <i>Fex </i>v. <i>Michigan, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/43/case.html">507 U. S. 43</a> (1993).</p><p>The Seventh Circuit\'s rationale is one of several approaches taken by Courts of Appeals addressing the availability of habeas review for violations of Articles IV(c) and lII(a). Some courts have denied relief without regard to whether the petitioner alerted the trial court to the lAD\'s speedy trial provisions. In this category, some decisions state that lAD speedy trial claims are never cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2254, because lAD speedy trial violations do not constitute a "fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice," under <i>Hill </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/424/case.html">368 U. S. 424</a>, 428 (1962). See, <i>e. g., Reilly </i>v. <i>Warden, FC! Petersburg, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/947/43/">947 F.2d 43</a>, 44-45 (CA2 1991) <i>(per curiam); Fasano </i>v. <i>Hall, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/615/555/">615 F.2d 555</a>, 558-559 (CA1 1980). Other courts applying the <i>Hill </i>standard have said \xc2\xa7 2254 is not available for failure to meet lAD speedy trial specifications unless the petitioner shows actual prejudice.

Reed had two clear chances to alert the trial judge in open court if he indeed wanted his trial to start on or before August 25, 1993. He let both opportunities pass by. At the pretrial hearings at which the trial date was set and rescheduled, on June 27 and August 1, Reed not only failed to mention the 120-day limit; he indicated a preference for holding the trial after his release from federal imprisonment, which was due to occur after the 120 days expired.

The Court of Appeals further elaborated:</p><blockquote><p>\n"During the pretrial conference of August 1, 1983, Reed presented several arguments based on the lAD, including claims that the federal government should have held a hearing before turning him over to the state and that his treatment in Indiana fell short of the state\'s obligations under Art.

Courts often require litigants to flag important issues orally rather than bury vital (and easily addressed) problems in reams of paper, as Reed did. E. g., Fed. R. Crim. P. 30 (requiring a distinct objection to jury instructions); cf. Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(b) (a district judge may require motions to be made orally).

Article V(c) does not address the discrete question whether relief for violations of the lAD\'s speedy trial provisions is available on collateral review. That matter is governed instead by the principles and precedent generally controlling availability of the great writ. See id., at 212. Referring to those guides, and particularly the Hill and Timmreck decisions, we conclude that a state court\'s failure to observe the 120-day rule of lAD Article IV(c) is not cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2254 when the defendant registered no objection to the trial date at the time it was set, and suffered no prejudice attributable to the delayed commencement.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Reed argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because the lAD\'s speedy trial provision "effectuates a constitutional right," the Sixth Amendment guarantee of a speedy trial.

Nor could he plausibly make such a claim.ll Indeed, asserting a need for more time to prepare for a trial that would be "fair and meaningful," App. 128, Reed himself <i>requested </i>a delay beyond the scheduled September 19 opening. A showing of prejudice is required to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial Clause, and that necessary ingredient is entirely missing here.

First, we have reserved the question whether federal habeas review is available to check violations of the lAD\'s speedy trial prescriptions when the state court disregards timely pleas for their application. See <i>supra, </i>at 349. Second, the lAD is both federal law and the law of Indiana. Ind. Code \xc2\xa7 35-33-10-4 (1993).

One class of those limitations consists of substantive restrictions upon the type of claim that will be entertained. <i>Hill, </i>for example, holds that the claim of a federal statutory violation will not be reviewed unless it alleges "a fundamental defect which inherently results in a complete miscarriage of justice [o]r an omission inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure." 368 U. S., at 428. Most statutory violations, at least when they do not occur "in the context of other aggravating circumstances," are simply not important enough to invoke the extraordinary habeas jurisdiction. <i>Id., </i>at 429.

To avoid the latter question, she conducts an analysis of how petitioner waived his lAD rights. See <i>ante, </i>at 350-351.

The guarantee of trial within 120 days of interjurisdictional transfer unless good cause is shown-a provision with no application to prisoners involved with only a single jurisdiction or incarcerated in one of the two States that do not participate in the voluntary lAD compact-simply cannot be among that select class of statutory rights.</p><p>As for <i>Hill </i>and <i>Timmreck\'s </i>reservation of the question whether habeas would be available "in the context of other aggravating circumstances," that seems to me clearly a reference to circumstances <i>that cause additional prejudice to the defendant, </i>thereby elevating the error to a fundamental defect or a denial of rudimentary procedural requirements<i>not </i>a reference to circumstances that make the trial judge\'s behavior more willful or egregious.

Cf. <i>Cuyler </i>v. <i>Adams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/433/case.html">449 U. S. 433</a>, 442 (1981). More importantly, however, federal habeas jurisdiction was not created with the intent, nor should we seek to give it the effect, of altering the fundamental disposition that <i>this Court, </i>and not individual federal district judges, has appellate jurisdiction, as to federal questions, over the supreme courts of the States.</p><p>If there was ever a technical rule, the lAD\'s 120-day limit is one. I think we produce confusion by declining to state the obvious: that violation of that technicality, intentional or unintentional, neither produces nor is analogous to (1) lack of jurisdiction of the convicting court, (2) constitutional violation, or (3) miscarriage of justice or denial of rudimentary procedures. It is no basis for federal habeas relief.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>In addition to substantive limitations on the equitable exercise of habeas jurisdiction, the Court has imposed procedural restrictions. For example, a habeas claim cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2255 (the correlative of \xc2\xa7 2254 for federal prisoners), such as a constitutional claim, will not be heard if it was procedurally defaulted below, absent a showing of cause and actual prejudice. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Frady, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/152/case.html">456 U. S. 152</a>, 167-168 (1982). And claims will ordinarily not be entertained under \xc2\xa7 2255 that have already been rejected on direct review. See <i>Kaufman </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/217/case.html">394 U. S. 217</a>, 227, n.8 (1969); see also <i>Withrow, </i>507 U.

Otherwise a prisoner, like petitioner, transferred from federal to state prison under the lAD would have three chances to raise his claim (state direct, state habeas, and \xc2\xa7 2254) while a prisoner transferred from state to federal prison under the lAD would have only one. Since the present petitioner raised his lAD claim on direct appeal in the Indiana courts and on state habeas review, his federal habeas claim could have been rejected on the ground that the writ ordinarily will not be used to readjudicate fully litigated statutory claims.</p><p>JUSTICE BLACKMUN, with whom JUSTICE STEVENS, JusTICE KENNEDY, and JUSTICE SOUTER join, dissenting.</p><p>The federal habeas corpus statute allows a state prisoner to challenge his conviction on the ground that he is "in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." 28 U.

Despite the professed narrowness of the Court\'s ultimate holding, however, its decision reflects certain assumptions about the nature of habeas review of state court judgments that do not withstand close analysis. Each of the cases relied on by the majority-Hill, <i>Timmreck, </i>and <i>Davis-concerned </i>a <i>federal </i>prisoner\'s request under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2255 for collateral relief from alleged defects in his federal trial. Before today, this Court never had applied those precedents to bar review of a \xc2\xa7 2254 petition.1 It does so now without a full discussion of, or appreciation for, the different policy concerns that should shape the exercise of federal courts\' discretion in \xc2\xa7 2254 cases.</p><p>1 The majority notes, <i>ante, </i>at 354, that the Court cited <i>Hill </i>in <i>Stone </i>v.</p><p><i>Powell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U.

Primary among them is the importance under \xc2\xa7 2254 of providing a federal forum for review of state prisoners\' federal claims, not only in order to ensure the enforcement of federal rights, but also to promote uniformity in the state courts\' interpretation and application of federallaw.3</p><p>We recognized in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Frady, </i>456 U.

That statement, however, did no more than parry the suggestion that federal prisoners, unlike state prisoners, were restricted to bringing claims "of constitutional dimension," and not those grounded in statutes. <i>Ibid. </i>The <i>Davis </i>Court was addressing only the threshold statutory basis for relief-specifically whether relief was available to federal prisoners for violations of "laws" of the United States. It said nothing about the equitable considerations that might guide the Court\'s exercise of its discretion to grant or deny relief. In other words, <i>Davis </i>concerned jurisdictional, not prudential, limits on habeas review. See <i>Withrow </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/case.html">507 U. S. 680</a>, 716 (1993) (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (the "sweeping" breadth of habeas jurisdiction is "tempered by the restraints that accompany the exercise of equitable discretion").</p><p>3 As a practical matter, this Court\'s direct review of state court decisions cannot adequately ensure uniformity. See id., at 721, n. (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("Of course a federal forum is theoretically available in this Court, by writ of certiorari.

S. 217</a>, 227, n. 8 (1969) (citation omitted). Under <i>Hill </i>and <i>Timmreck, </i>relief may be limited to the correction of "fundamental defect[s]" or "omission[s] inconsistent with the rudimentary demands of fair procedure." <i>Hill, </i>368 U. S., at 428. The <i>Hill </i>principle, in short, is that where the error is not egregious, the habeas court need not cover the ground already covered by other federal courts.</p><p>For the state prisoner, by contrast, a primary purpose of \xc2\xa7 2254 is to provide a federal forum to review a state prisoner\'s claimed violations of federal law, claims that were, of necessity, addressed to the state courts. See <i>Brown </i>v. <i>Allen, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html">344 U. S. 443</a>, 508 (1953) (opinion of Frankfurter, J.)

Thus, \xc2\xa7 2254 motions anticipate that the federal court will undertake an independent review of the work of the state courts, even where the federal claim was fully and fairly litigated. <i>Wright </i>v. <i>West, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/277/case.html">505 U.

In a federal trial and appeal, virtually any procedural error, however minor, will violate a "law" of the United States. In this context, it is both impracticable and unnecessary to allow collateral review of all claims of error, particularly since the defendant has had the opportunity both to raise them in and to appeal them to a federal forum. I t is hardly surprising, therefore, that the Hill-Timmreck screening device, which sorts the substantial errors from the mere technical violations, was developed in \xc2\xa7 2255. A state trial, by contrast, implicates few federal laws outside the Constitution. On the extraordinary occasions when Congress does consider a federal law to be so important as to warrant its application in state proceedings, this alone counsels an approach other</p><p>5 JUSTICE SCALIA proposes to foreclose \xc2\xa7 2254 review of federal nonconstitutional claims where the state prisoner was afforded a full and fair opportunity to litigate those claims in state court. This proposal fails for obvious reasons. To hold that full and fair litigation in state courts is a substitute for a federal forum would be, to borrow a phrase, to "suc[k] the life out of [\xc2\xa72254]." See <i>ante, </i>at 357 (concurring opinion). At the heart of \xc2\xa7 2254 is federal court review of state court decisions on federal law. With one notable exception, see <i>Stone </i>v. <i>Powell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/case.html">428 U. S. 465</a>, 486-496 (1976), this Court uniformly has rejected a "full and fair opportunity to litigate" as a bar to \xc2\xa7 2254 review.

Hill has been read to disfavor habeas review of federal statutory violations as a class. See, <i>e. </i>g., <i>ante, </i>at 356 (concurring opinion) (reading Hill for the proposition that "[m]ost statutory violations ... are simply not important enough to invoke the extraordinary habeas jurisdiction"). This distinction between statutory and constitutional violations, exaggerated even in the context of \xc2\xa7 2255,7 has even less justification under \xc2\xa7 2254.</p><p>6 There is an additional reason to question the application of the HillTimmreck "fundamental error" or "miscarriage of justice" standard to Reed\'s \xc2\xa7 2254 claim. In both Hill and Timmreck, a federal prisoner bypassed an available federal appeal, and this Court endorsed the rule of Sunal v. Large, <a href="/cases/federal/us/332/174/case.html">332 U. S. 174</a>, 178 (1947), that collateral attack cannot "do service for an appeal." See Hill, 368 U. S., at 428-429 (finding "apposite" the reasoning in Sunal, 332 U. S., at 178, that" \'[w]ise judicial administration of the federal courts\' " counseled against permitting a collateral attack to supplant appeals); Timmreck, 441 U. S., at 784 (seeing "no basis here for allowing collateral attack \'to do service for an appeal\'\'\') (quoting Sunal, 332 U. S., at 178); see also Hill, 368 U. S., at 428-429 (noting that Congress "\'provided a regular, orderly method for correction\'" of errors by " \'granting an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals and by vesting us with certiorari jurisdiction\'" and that if defendants were permitted to bypass this orderly method, "\'[e]rror which was not deemed sufficiently adequate to warrant an appeal would acquire new implications\'\'\') (quoting Sunal, 332 U. S., at 181-182). Thus, this standard appears to have been based in part on principles of default. Our habeas jurisprudence subsequently has imposed a procedural default bar in \xc2\xa7 2254 cases, Wainwright</p><p>7 Hill and Timmreck can be read for the proposition that at least some nonconstitutional violations "are simply not important enough" to warrant habeas relief. In Hill, for example, a federal prisoner who did not appeal his conviction was not permitted to obtain collateral relief based on the sentencing court\'s "failure to comply with the formal requirements" of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="365">365</a></p><p>The language of \xc2\xa7 2254 itself permits a state prisoner to seek relief for a violation "of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States." By its own terms, then, \xc2\xa7 2254 applies equally to claims of statutory or constitutional violations. When construing the similar language of Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7 1979, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1983, which permits civil actions against state actors for "deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws" of the United States, we concluded that "the phrase \'and laws,\' as used in \xc2\xa7 1983, means what it says." <i>Maine </i>v. <i>Thiboutot, </i>448 U. S.</p><p>Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32(a), which commands that every defendant be allowed to make a statement before he is sentenced. 368 U. S., at 429. Similarly, in <i>Timmreck, </i>the Court held that a federal prisoner who did not appeal the validity of his guilty plea could not obtain collateral relief under \xc2\xa7 2255 for technical violation of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, which requires the court to ask a defendant represented by an attorney whether he wishes to say anything on his own behalf. 441 U. S., at 784.</p><p>These cases could also be read narrowly as relying on the habeas petitioner\'s default on direct review, see n. 6, <i>supra, </i>or as encompassing only violations of procedural rules. But even if read to establish a line between "important" and "merely technical" violations, this line is not identical to the line between statutory and constitutional violations. We made this point clear in <i>Davis </i>v. <i>United States, </i>417 U. S., at 345-346:</p><p>"[T]here is no support in the prior holdings of this Court for the proposition that a claim is not cognizable under \xc2\xa7 2255 merely because it is grounded in the \'laws of the United States\' rather than the Constitution.

S. 174</a> (1947), the Court held that the nonconstitutional claim in that case could not be asserted to set aside a conviction on collateral attack. But <i>Sunal </i>was merely an example of \'the general rule ... that the writ of <i>habeas corpus </i>will not be allowed to do service for an appeal.\' ... Thus, <i>Sunal </i>cannot be read to stand for the broad proposition that nonconstitutional claims can never be asserted in collateral attacks upon criminal convictions. Rather, the implication would seem to be that, absent the particular considerations regarded as dispositive in that case, the fact that a contention is grounded not in the Constitution, but in the \'laws of the United States\' would not preclude its assertion in a \xc2\xa7 2255 proceeding."</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="366">366</a></p><p>1,4 (1980) (refusing to construe "and laws" as limited to civil rights or equal protection laws); <i>Hague </i>v. <i>CIO, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">307 U.

Section 1983 was enacted contemporaneously with \xc2\xa7 2254, and it shares the common purpose of making the federal courts available for the uniform interpretation and enforcement of federal rights in state settings. There is no reason to read \xc2\xa7 1983 as placing statutes on a par with the Constitution, but to read \xc2\xa7 2254 as largely indifferent to violations of statutes.</p><p>Moreover, at least until today, this Court never had held that a properly preserved claim of a violation of a federal statute should be treated differently in a \xc2\xa7 2254 proceeding from a claim of a violation of the Constitution. Nor is there any reason to do so. Congress\' decision to apply a federal statute to state criminal proceedings, which ordinarily are the exclusive province of state legislatures, generally should be read to reflect the congressional determination that important national interests are at stake. Where Congress has made this determination, the federal courts should be open to ensure the uniform enforcement and interpretation of these interests.</p><p>It should be clear, then, that the distinction drawn in \xc2\xa7 2255 between fundamental errors and "omission[s] of the kind contemplated in <i>Hill, Timmreck, </i>or <i>Davis," ante, </i>at 349, simply does not support a distinction in \xc2\xa7 2254 between constitutional and statutory violations.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Even putting aside any misgivings about the general extension of <i>Hill </i>to \xc2\xa7 2254 proceedings, there is a specific, and I believe insurmountable, obstacle to applying this standard to violations of the lAD.

Article IV(c) of the lAD provides that the trial of a transferred prisoner "shall be commenced within one hundred and twenty days" of his arrival in the receiving jurisdiction.8 The lAD is equally clear about the consequences of a failure to bring a defendant to trial within the prescribed time limits. Article V(c) states:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[I]n the event that an action on the indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which the detainer has been lodged is not brought to trial within the period provided in article III or article IV hereof, the appropriate court of the jurisdiction where the indictment, information, or complaint has been pending shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice, and any detainer based thereon shall cease to be of any force or effect."</p></blockquote><p>Quite simply, Congress has determined that a reCeIVIng State must try the defendant within 120 days or not at all. This determination undermines the majority\'s approach for two reasons.</p><p>8 This command is subject to only two qualifications. First, Article IV(c) itself provides that "for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance." Second, Article VI(a) provides: "In determining the duration and expiration dates of the time periods provided in articles III and IV of this agreement, the running of said time periods shall be tolled whenever and for as long as the prisoner is unable to stand trial, as determined by the court having jurisdiction of the matter." The majority relies on neither qualification, nor did the Indiana state courts.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="368">368</a></p><p>First, the congressional imposition of the drastic sanction of dismissal forecloses any argument that a violation of the lAD time limits is somehow a mere "technical" violation too trivial to warrant habeas review. The dismissal with prejudice of criminal charges is a remedy rarely seen in criminal law, even for constitutional violations. See, <i>e. g., Barker </i>v. <i>Wingo, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/407/514/case.html">407 U. S. 514</a> (1972) (violation of Sixth Amendment speedy trial right); <i>Oregon </i>v. <i>Kennedy, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/667/case.html">456 U. S. 667</a> (1982) (violation of Double Jeopardy Clause). In fact, there are countless constitutional violations for which habeas review is allowed, but dismissal is not required. However this Court might have assessed the "fundamentality" of a violation of the lAD time limits in the absence of this sanction, this congressional directive does not leave us free to determine that violating the lAD time limits is no more serious than failure to comply with the technical requirements of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Timmreck, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/441/780/case.html">441 U.

S., at 428.</p><p>Surely, a violation that Congress found troubling enough to warrant the severe remedy of dismissal cannot become trivial simply because the defendant did not utter what this Court later determines to be the magic words at the magic moment, particularly in the absence of any congressional requirement that the defendant either invoke his right to a timely trial or object to the setting of an untimely trial date. In the absence of any suggestion that Reed procedurally defaulted on his lAD claim so as to deprive him of relief on direct review, it is curious, to say the least, to deny habeas relief based largely on a sort of "quasi-default" standard. Such a two-tiered "default" standard is unwarranted, and to my knowledge, unprecedented.9 Cf. <i>Davis </i>v. <i>United States,</i></p><p>9 Sunal, Hill, and Timmreck, in which the defendant took no appeal from a federal conviction, provide no support for this quasi-waiver standard. None of these cases presents a situation in which the defendant\'s</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="369">369</a></p><p><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/233/case.html">411 U. S. 233</a>, 239, n. 6 (1973) (finding it "difficult to conceptualize the application of one waiver rule for purposes of federal appeal and another for purposes of federal habeas corpus").</p><p>Second, Congress\' clear mandate of the remedy of dismissal can be read to constrain this Court\'s equitable or supervisory powers to determine an appropriate remedy, either on direct review or on habeas.lO Nothing in our case law even suggests that, where Congress has mandated a remedy for the violation of a federal law, a habeas court is free to cast about for a different remedy. The remedy prescribed by the statute must be the remedy that "law and justice require." 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2243. In other words, the prerogative writ of habeas corpus should be exercised in accord with an express legislative command. See lAD, Art. IX, \xc2\xa7 5 (directing "[a]ll courts ... of the United States ...  to enforce the agreement on detainers and to cooperate ...  with all party States in enforcing the agreement and effectuating its purpose"). At the very least, the drastic remedy of dismissal saves the lAD from falling below the Hill fundamentality line.</p><p>conduct was sufficient to present and preserve an issue for appeal, but was found somehow wanting for habeas purposes.</p><p><i>10 </i>McCarthy v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/459/case.html">394 U. S. 459</a>, 464, 468-472 (1969), and <i>Timmreck, </i>441 U. S., at 784, are not to the contrary. In <i>McCarthy, </i>the Court looked to the language and purposes of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 and to the lower courts\' varying responses to noncompliance before requiring, as an exercise of the Court\'s supervisory powers, relief for Rule 11 violations raised on direct review. In <i>Timmreck, </i>the Court denied relief on collateral review for a comparable Rule 11 violation, in part because, under <i>McCarthy, </i>the defendant could have challenged it on direct appeal, but did not. In these cases, of course, the remedy for a violation was left to the Court. In requiring relief on direct review, but not on habeas, the Court was at most differing with itself. It was not disregarding a congressional directive.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="370">370</a></p><p>In sum, under a faithful reading of the lAD, the state trial court was required to dismiss with prejudice all charges against Reed because his trial did not commence within 120 days of his transfer to Indiana state custody. Faced with the state courts\' failure to impose this remedy, the federal habeas court should have done so.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>A final word is in order about the Court\'s emphasis on Reed\'s conduct and its suggestion that relief might be in order if only Reed had objected at the "relevant" moments. Under one reading of the majority opinion, the Court concludes that Reed\'s failure to make oral objections at the pretrial hearings somehow mitigates the seriousness of the failure to bring him to trial within the lAD time limits. In other words, the majority suggests that it is the "unobjected-to" nature of the violation, <i>ante, </i>at 356 (concurring opinion), that reduces it to the level of a Hill-Timmreck error, one with which the habeas court should not concern itself. But as already explained, the statute itself does not permit this Court to denigrate the significance of the violation.</p><p>It is also possible, however, to read the majority opinion as relying on a theory of waiver or procedural default. This theory is equally untenable, particularly when due consideration is given not only to the language of the lAD, but also to Reed\'s repeated attempts to invoke its protections. The lAD itself does not require dismissal for a violation of its 120-day limit only "upon motion of the defendant," much less "upon defendant\'s timely oral objection to the setting of the trial date." Instead, the statute unambiguously directs courts to dismiss charges when the time limits are breached. This arguably puts the responsibility on courts and States to police the applicable time limits. This is a reasonable choice for Congress to make. Judges and prosecutors are players who can be expected to know the lAD\'s straightforward re-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="371">371</a></p><p>quirements and to make a simple time calculation at the outset of the proceedings against a transferred defendant.</p><p>Indeed, in this case, the trial court and prosecutor both had constructive notice of the lAD time limits. The Fulton County Circuit Court signed and certified that the request for temporary custody was transmitted "for action in accordance with its terms <i>and the provisions of the Agreement on Detainers." </i>App. 5-6 (emphasis added). The State\'s request stated: "I propose to bring this person to trial on this [information] within the time period specified in Article IV(c) of the [lAD]." <i>Id., </i>at 5.</p><p>Even assuming, however, that a defendant must invoke the lAD\'s time limits in order to obtain its protections, Reed clearly did so here. In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mauro, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/340/case.html">436 U. S. 340</a> (1978), this Court agreed that the defendant\'s "failure to invoke the [lAD] <i>in specific terms </i>in his speedy trial motions before the District Court did not result in a waiver" of his claim that the Government violated the lAD. <i>Id., </i>at 364 (emphasis added). We concluded, instead, that the prosecution and the court were "on notice of the substance" of an inmate\'s lAD claims when he "persistently requested that he be given a speedy trial" and "sought the dismissal of his indictment on the ground that the delay in bringing him to trial while the detainer remained lodged against him was causing him to be denied certain privileges at the state prison." <i>Id., </i>at 364, 365. Reed did no less.</p><p>On May 9, 1983, at his first appearance before the court, Reed, appearing without counsel, informed the court that he would be in a halfway house but for the detainer. App. 12. The court acknowledged that there is a "world of difference" between a halfway house and the Fulton County jail. <i>Id., </i>at 14. The court later observed that Reed\'s incarceration rendered him incapable of preparing his defense. <i>Id., </i>at 54.</p><p>At the June 27 pretrial conference, Reed asked the court if it would prefer future motions orally or in writing. The court responded, "I want it in writing," and "I read better</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="372">372</a></p><p>than I listen." <i>Id., </i>at 39-40; see also <i>id., </i>at 123 (noting preference for written motions). Conforming to this request, Reed filed a motion on July 25, requesting that "trial be held within the legal guidelines of the Agreement on Detainer Act." <i>Id., </i>at 56. Clarifying his concerns, Reed complained that the State of Indiana was "forcing [him] to be tried beyond the limits as set forth in the Agreement on Detainer Act," and specifically "request[ed that] no extension of time be granted beyond those guidelines." <i>Ibid. </i>This <i>pro se </i>motion was filed 31 days before the 120-day period expired.</p><p>Three days later, Reed filed a motion stating that there was "limited time left for trial within the laws." <i>Id., </i>at 88. This <i>pro se </i>motion was filed 28 days before the lAD clock ran out. Finally, on August 11, he filed a motion for subpoenas that sought prompt relief because the "Detainer Act time limits" were "approaching." <i>Id., </i>at 91. This <i>pro se </i>motion was filed 15 days before the 120-day lAD time limit expired.</p><p>Thus, after being instructed that the court wanted all motions in writing, Reed filed three timely written motions indicating his desire to be tried within the lAD time limits. The Supreme Court of Indiana concluded that Reed\'s July 26 motion constituted "a general demand that trial be held within the time limits of the lAD." 491 N. E. 2d 182, 185 (1993). Under Mauro, this was enough to put the court on notice of his demands. Even as an original matter, when a trial court instructs a <i>pro se </i>defendant to put his motions in writing, and the defendant does so, not once, but three times, it is wholly unwarranted then to penalize him for failing to object orally at what this Court later singles out as the magic moment.ll</p><p>11 The Court, referring to the "clarity" of Reed\'s August 29 motion seeking discharge of the indictment, suggests that he deliberately obscured his request until after the clock had run. <i>Ante, </i>at 344, 349. The Court fails to mention, however, that Reed prepared his earlier motions both without counsel and without adequate access to legal materials. It was only at the August 1 pretrial conference that the court ordered the sheriff to pro-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="373">373</a></p><p>This should be a simple matter. Reed invoked, and the trial court denied, his right to be tried within the lAD\'s 120day time limit. Section 2254 authorizes federal courts to grant for such a violation whatever relief law and justice require. The lAD requires dismissal of the indictment. Nothing in the lAD, in \xc2\xa7 2254, or in our precedent requires or even suggests that federal courts should refrain from entertaining a state prisoner\'s claims of a violation of the lAD. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p><p>vide Reed with access to legal materials. App. 85. On August 9, Reed was given two lawbooks, including one on Indiana criminal procedure, and thereafter his draftsmanship improved.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
