A sale made without "a license to trade," by a loyal citizen of the United States on the 6th of March, 1865, when Savannah was occupied by the federal troops, to a loyal citizen of New York, of cotton which had been returned by the owner, registered, and taken into possession by the United States, and sent for sale to New York under the Captured and Abandoned Property Act <em>held</em> void, although the bill of sale of the cotton authorized the attorney of the vendors to receive the proceeds of sale and pay them to the vendees, and was thus argued to have been not a sale of the cotton at Savannah, Georgia, but a sale of claim in Washington, D.C.  This was apparently decided under the Act of July 13, 1861, prohibiting and making unlawful</p>\n<p>"all commercial intercourse between the inhabitants of any state proclaimed to be in a state of insurrection against the United States and the citizens of the rest of the United States so long as such condition of hostility should continue,"</p>\n<p>and the Act of July 2, 1864, making the prohibition applicable to all commercial intercourse to persons being within districts within the lines of National military occupation in such states. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 84 U.

On the day just named, Savannah was captured by the army of the United States.  On the 23d of February, 1865, Cutner reported his cotton to the commanding officer, and it was registered, in compliance with general military orders, by the Treasury agents in his name; and on the 3d of March following taken into the custody of the Treasury agents of the United States and shipped to New York, and there sold by the United States; the net proceeds, amounting to $6,897, being paid into the Treasury.</p>\n<p>On the 6th of March, 1865, Cutner executed a bill of sale of the cotton specifically, and describing it as "all that certain lot and quantity of cotton, <em>viz.,</em> thirty bales of cotton, marked S.C.," to Schiffer &amp; Co., of New York, and received at the time, from one Stewart, the attorney and agent of Schiffer &amp; Co., $2,250, the entire consideration named in the bill of sale.  The bill of sale recited that the cotton sold was the same which he, Cutner, had described in a petition of March 6, 1865, to the President of the United States; and it authorized Stewart, the attorney, "to pay over to Schiffer &amp; Co. any and all proceeds which may arise from the same when sold."  At the time of this sale Schiffer &amp; Co. had no license to trade with the enemy.</p>\n<p>By Act of July 13, 1861, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] it was enacted, that "all commercial intercourse" between the inhabitants of any state, or any section, or part thereof, who the President should declare "were in a state of insurrection against the United </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 84 U.

That the pretended transfer of the cotton by Cutner to Schiffer, on 6th March, 1865, was in violation of the nonintercourse acts of Congress and the President\'s proclamations made subsequent thereto, and therefore inoperative to clothe the real claimant, Schiffer, with a valid title to the cotton, or to vest in him a right to the proceeds thereof.</p>\n<p>The court accordingly dismissed the petition.

JUSTICE BRADLEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Intercourse between the inhabitants of the two belligerent sections was still prohibited when this sale was made.  It was therefore clearly illegal, unless Schiffer &amp; Co. had a license to trade in Savannah, which the case expressly finds they had not.  The sale being illegal, the suit cannot be sustained for the benefit of the vendees.  It cannot be sustained for Cutner\'s own benefit, because he received the full consideration of the cotton and has no interest remaining.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>12 Stat. at Large 257.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>12 Stat. at Large 1262.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>13 <em>id.</em> 376, \xc2\xa7 4.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
