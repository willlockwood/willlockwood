BMS is incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York, and it maintains substantial operations in both New York and New Jersey.  Although it engages in business activities in California and sells Plavix there, BMS did not develop, create a marketing strategy for, manufacture, label, package, or work on the regulatory approval for Plavix in the State.  And the nonresident plaintiffs did not allege that they obtained Plavix from a California source, that they were injured by Plavix in California, or that they were treated for their injuries in California.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The California Superior Court denied BMS\xe2\x80\x99s motion to quash service of summons on the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims for lack of personal jurisdiction, concluding that BMS\xe2\x80\x99s extensive activities in the State gave the California courts general jurisdiction.  Following this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Daimler AG</i> v. <i>Bauman</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, the State Court of Appeal found that the California courts lacked general jurisdiction.  But the Court of Appeal went on to find that the California courts had specific jurisdiction over the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs.  Affirming, the State Supreme Court applied a \xe2\x80\x9csliding scale approach\xe2\x80\x9d to specific jurisdiction, concluding that BMS\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwide ranging\xe2\x80\x9d contacts with the State were enough to support a finding of specific jurisdiction over the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs.  That attenuated connection was met, the court held, in part because the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were similar in many ways to the California residents\xe2\x80\x99 claims and because BMS engaged in other activities in the State.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: California courts lack specific jurisdiction to entertain the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have recognized two types of personal jurisdiction: general and specific.  For general jurisdiction, the \xe2\x80\x9cparadigm forum\xe2\x80\x9d is an \xe2\x80\x9cindividual\xe2\x80\x99s domicile,\xe2\x80\x9d or, for corporations, \xe2\x80\x9can equivalent place, one in which the corporation is fairly regarded as at home.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 924.  Specific jurisdiction, however, requires \xe2\x80\x9cthe suit\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] out of or relat[e] to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with the forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Daimler</i>,<i> supra</i>,<i> </i>at ___ (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The \xe2\x80\x9cprimary concern\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing personal jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden on the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp.</i> v. <i>Woodson</i>,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 286\n.  Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.

For a court to exercise specific jurisdiction over a claim there must be an \xe2\x80\x9caffiliation between the forum and the underlying controversy, principally, [an] activity or an occurrence that takes place in the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Goodyear</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 919 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  When no such connection exists, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unconnected activities in the State.  The California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csliding scale approach\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94is thus difficult to square with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents.  That court found specific jurisdiction without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  The mere fact that <i>other</i> plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Nor is it sufficient (or relevant) that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix.  What is needed is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.  Cf. <i>Walden</i> v. <i>Fiore</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.

And <i>Shutts</i>, which concerned the due process rights of <i>plaintiffs,</i> has no bearing on the question presented here.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0BMS\xe2\x80\x99s decision to contract with McKesson, a California company, to distribute Plavix nationally does not provide a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.  It is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California or that BMS is derivatively liable for McKesson\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in California.  The bare fact that BMS contracted with a California distributor is not enough to establish personal jurisdiction in the State.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(e)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision will not result in the parade of horribles that respondents conjure up.  It does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS.  Alternatively, the nonresident plaintiffs could probably sue together in their respective home States.  In addition, since this decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, the question remains open whether the\n \nFifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.

A court with general jurisdiction may hear <i>any</i> claim against that defendant, even if all the incidents underlying the claim occurred in a different State.  <i>Id.</i>, at 919.  But \xe2\x80\x9conly a limited set of affiliations with a forum will render a defendant amenable to\xe2\x80\x9d general jurisdiction in that State.  <i>Daimler</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 18).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Specific jurisdiction is very different.

Assessing this burden obviously requires a court to consider the practical problems resulting from litigating in the forum, but it also encompasses the more abstract matter of submitting to the coercive power of a State that may have little legitimate interest in the claims in question.  As we have put it, restrictions on personal jurisdiction \xe2\x80\x9care more than a guarantee of immunity from inconvenient or distant litigation.  They are a consequence of territorial limitations on the power of the respective States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla</i>,\n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235,\n251 (1958)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he States retain many essential attributes of sovereignty, including, in particular, the sovereign power to try causes in their courts.

And at times, this federalism interest may be decisive.  As we explained in <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; even if the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the controversy; even if the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation, the Due Process Clause, acting as an instrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to divest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 294.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our settled principles regarding specific jurisdiction control this case.

When there is no such connection, specific jurisdiction is lacking regardless of the extent of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unconnected activities in the State.  See <i>id.</i>, at 931, n.\xc2\xa06 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven regularly occurring sales of a product in a State do not justify the exercise of jurisdiction over a claim unrelated to those sales\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For this reason, the California Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csliding scale approach\xe2\x80\x9d is difficult to square with our precedents.  Under the California approach, the strength of the requisite connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue is relaxed if the defendant has extensive forum contacts that are unrelated to those claims.  Our cases provide no support for this approach, which resembles a loose and spurious form of general jurisdiction.  For spe-cific jurisdiction, a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s general connections with the forum are not enough.  As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98continuous activity of some sorts within a state .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not enough to support the demand that the corporation be amenable to suits unrelated to that activity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 927 (quoting<i> International Shoe</i>, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The present case illustrates the danger of the California approach.  The State Supreme Court found that specific jurisdiction was present without identifying any adequate link between the State and the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  As noted, the nonresidents were not prescribed Plavix in California, did not purchase Plavix in California, did not ingest Plavix in California, and were not injured by Plavix in California.  The mere fact that <i>other </i>plaintiffs were prescribed, obtained, and ingested Plavix in California\xe2\x80\x94and allegedly sustained the same injuries as did the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x94does not allow the State to assert specific jurisdiction over the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  As we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Walden</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  This remains true even when third parties (here, the plaintiffs who reside in California) can bring claims similar to those brought by the nonresidents.  Nor is it sufficient\xe2\x80\x94or even relevant\xe2\x80\x94that BMS conducted research in California on matters unrelated to Plavix.  What is needed\xe2\x80\x94and what is missing here\xe2\x80\x94is a connection between the forum and the specific claims at issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our decision in <i>Walden</i>, <i>supra</i>, illustrates this requirement.  In that case, Nevada plaintiffs sued an out-of-state defendant for conducting an allegedly unlawful search of the plaintiffs while they were in Georgia preparing to board a plane bound for Nevada.  We held that the Nevada courts lacked specific jurisdiction even though the plaintiffs were Nevada residents and \xe2\x80\x9csuffered foreseeable harm in Nevada.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 11).  Because the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>relevant</i> conduct occurred entirely in Georgi[a] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the mere fact that [this] conduct affected plaintiffs with connections to the forum State d[id] not suffice to authorize jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 14) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In today\xe2\x80\x99s case, the connection between the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims and the forum is even weaker.  The relevant plaintiffs are not California residents and do not claim to have suffered harm in that State.  In addition, as in <i>Walden</i>, all the conduct giving rise to the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims occurred elsewhere.  It follows that the California courts cannot claim specific jurisdiction.  See <i>World-Wide Volkswagen</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 295 (finding no personal jurisdiction in Oklahoma because the defendant \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ied] on no activ-ity whatsoever in Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x9d and dismissing \xe2\x80\x9cthe fortuitous circumstance that a single Audi automobile, sold [by defendants] in New York to New York residents, happened to suffer an accident while passing through Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9cisolated occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The nonresidents maintain that two of our cases sup-port the decision below, but they misinterpret those precedents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Keeton</i> v. <i>Hustler Magazine, Inc.</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 770 (1984)\n, a New York resident sued Hustler in New Hampshire, claiming that she had been libeled in five issues of the magazine, which was distributed throughout the country, including in New Hampshire, where it sold 10,000 to 15,000 copies per month.  Concluding that specific jurisdiction was present, we relied principally on the connection between the circulation of the magazine in New Hampshire and damage allegedly caused within the State.  We noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]alse statements of fact harm both the subject of the falsehood and the readers of the statement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 776 (emphasis deleted).  This factor amply distinguishes <i>Keeton</i> from the present case, for here the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims involve no harm in California and no harm to California residents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The nonresident plaintiffs in this case point to our holding in <i>Keeton</i> that there was jurisdiction in New Hampshire to entertain the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s request for damages suffered outside the State, <i>id.</i>, at 774, but that holding concerned jurisdiction to determine <i>the scope of a claim</i> involving in-state injury and injury to residents of the State, not, as in this case, jurisdiction to entertain claims involving no in-state injury and no injury to residents of the forum State.  <i>Keeton</i> held that there was jurisdiction in New Hampshire to consider the full measure of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim, but whether she could actually recover out-of-state damages was a merits question governed by New Hampshire libel law.  <i>Id</i>., at 778, n. 9.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Phillips Petroleum Co. </i>v. <i>Shutts</i>,\n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 797 (1985)\n, which involved a class action filed in Kansas, is even less relevant.  The Kansas court exercised personal jurisdiction over the claims of nonresident class members, and the defendant, Phillips Petroleum, argued that this violated the due process rights of these class members because they lacked minimum contacts with the State.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  According to the defendant, the out-of-state class members should not have been kept in the case unless they affirmatively opted in, instead of merely failing to opt out after receiving notice.  <i>Id.</i>, at 812.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Holding that there had been no due process violation, the Court explained that the authority of a State to entertain the claims of nonresident class members is entirely different from its authority to exercise jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant.  <i>Id.</i>, at 808\xe2\x80\x93812.  Since <i>Shutts</i> concerned the due process rights of <i>plaintiffs</i>, it has no bearing on the question presented here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents nevertheless contend that <i>Shutts</i> supports their position because, in their words, it would be \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd to believe that [this Court] would have reached the exact opposite result if the petitioner [Phillips] had only invoked its own due-process rights, rather than those of the non-resident plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 28\xe2\x80\x9329, n.\xc2\xa06 (emphasis deleted).  But the fact remains that Phillips did not assert that Kansas improperly exercised personal jurisdiction over it, and the Court did not address that issue.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  Indeed, the Court stated specifically that its \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion of personal jurisdiction [did not] address class actions where the jurisdiction is asserted against a <i>defendant</i> class.<i>\xe2\x80\x9d  Shutts</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 812, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In a last ditch contention, respondents contend that BMS\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to contract with a California company [McKesson] to distribute [Plavix] nationally\xe2\x80\x9d provides a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32.  But as we have explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he requirements of <i>International Shoe</i> .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must be met as to each defendant over whom a state court exercises jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rush</i> v. <i>Savchuk</i>,\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n332 (1980)\n; see <i>Walden</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op, at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. third party, standing alone, is an insufficient basis for jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this case, it is not alleged that BMS engaged in relevant acts together with McKesson in California.

Our decision does not prevent the California and out-of-state plaintiffs from joining together in a consolidated action in the States that have general jurisdiction over BMS.  BMS concedes that such suits could be brought in either New York or Delaware.  See Brief for Petitioner 13.  Alternatively, the plaintiffs who are residents of a particular State\xe2\x80\x94for example, the 92 plaintiffs from Texas and the 71 from Ohio\xe2\x80\x94could probably sue together in their home States.  In addition, since our decision concerns the due process limits on the exercise of specific jurisdiction by a State, we leave open the question whether the\n \nFifth Amendment imposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by a federal court.

Today, the Court takes its first step toward a similar contraction of specific jurisdiction by holding that a corporation that engages in a nationwide course of conduct cannot be held accountable in a state court by a group of injured people unless all of those people were injured in the forum State.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I fear the consequences of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today will be substantial.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule will make it difficult to aggregate the claims of plaintiffs across the country whose claims may be worth little alone.  It will make it impossible to bring a nationwide mass action in state court against defendants who are \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in different States.  And it will result in piecemeal litigation and the bifurcation of claims.  None of this is necessary.  A core concern in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s personal jurisdiction cases is fairness.  And there is nothing unfair about subjecting a massive corporation to suit in a State for a nationwide course of conduct that injures both forum residents and nonresidents alike.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Bristol-Myers Squibb is a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in New York.  It employs approximately 25,000 people worldwide and earns annual revenues of over $15 billion.  In the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, Bristol-Myers began to market and sell a prescription blood thinner called Plavix.  Plavix was advertised as an effective tool for reducing the risk of blood clotting for those vulnerable to heart attacks and to strokes.  The ads worked: At the height of its popularity, Plavix was a blockbuster, earning Bristol-Myers billions of dollars in annual revenues.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Bristol-Myers\xe2\x80\x99 advertising and distribution efforts were national in scope.  It conducted a single nationwide advertising campaign for Plavix, using television, magazine, and Internet ads to broadcast its message.  A consumer in California heard the same advertisement as a consumer in Maine about the benefits of Plavix.  Bristol-Myers\xe2\x80\x99 distribution of Plavix also proceeded through nationwide channels: Consistent with its usual practice, it relied on a small number of wholesalers to distribute Plavix throughout the country.  One of those distributors, McKesson Corporation, was named as a defendant below; during the relevant time period, McKesson was responsible for almost a quarter of Bristol-Myers\xe2\x80\x99 revenue worldwide.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The 2005 publication of an article in the New England Journal of Medicine questioning the efficacy and safety of Plavix put Bristol-Myers on the defensive, as consumers around the country began to claim that they were injured by the drug.  The plaintiffs in these consolidated cases are 86 people who allege they were injured by Plavix in California and several hundred others who say they were injured by the drug in other States.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  They filed their suits in California Superior Court, raising product-liability claims against Bristol-Myers and McKesson.  Their claims are \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially identical,\xe2\x80\x9d as Bristol-Myers concedes.  See Brief for Petitioner 4, n.\xc2\xa01.  Bristol-Myers acknowledged it was subject to suit in California state court by the residents of that State.  But it moved to dismiss the claims brought by the nonresident plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94respondents here\xe2\x80\x94for lack of jurisdiction.  The question here, accordingly, is not whether Bristol-Myers is subject to suit in California on claims that arise out of the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of Plavix\xe2\x80\x94it is.  The question is whether Bristol-Myers is subject to suit in California only on the residents\xe2\x80\x99 claims, or whether a state court may also hear the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cidentical\xe2\x80\x9d claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the majority explains, since our pathmarking opinion in <i>International Shoe Co.</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310 (1945)\n, the touchstone of the personal-jurisdiction analysis has been the question whether a defendant has \xe2\x80\x9ccertain minimum contacts with [the State] such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 316 (quoting <i>Milliken</i> v. <i>Meyer</i>,\n\n311 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n463 (1940)\n).  For decades this Court has considered that question through two different jurisdictional frames: \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cspecific\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  See <i>Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Hall</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 408\n, nn. 8\xe2\x80\x939 (1984).  Under our current case law, a state court may exercise general, or all-purpose, jurisdiction over a defendant corporation only if its \xe2\x80\x9caffiliations with the State are so \xe2\x80\x98continuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x99 as to render [it] essentially at home in the forum State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 915,\n919 (2011)\n.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If general jurisdiction is not appropriate, however, a state court can exercise only specific, or case-linked, jurisdiction over a dispute.  <i>Id.,</i> at 923\xe2\x80\x93924.  Our cases have set out three conditions for the exercise of specific jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  4A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; A. Steinman, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71069, pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9378 (4th ed. 2015) (Wright); see also <i>id.,</i> at 22\xe2\x80\x9327, n.\xc2\xa010 (collecting authority).  First, the defendant must have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98purposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the forum State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or have purposefully directed its conduct into the forum State.  <i>J. McIntyre Machinery, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Nicastro</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 873,\n877 (2011)\n (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Hanson</i> v. <i>Denckla</i>,\n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 235,\n253 (1958)\n).  Second, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim must \xe2\x80\x9carise out of or relate to\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s forum conduct.  <i>Helicopteros</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 414.  Finally, the exercise of jurisdiction must be reasonable under the circumstances.  <i>Asahi Metal Industry Co.</i> v. <i>Superior Court of Cal., Solano Cty.</i>,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 102\n\xe2\x80\x93114 (1987); <i>Burger King Corp.</i> v. <i>Rudzewicz</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 462\n\xe2\x80\x93478 (1985).  The factors relevant to such an analysis include \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden on the defendant, the forum State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in adjudicating the dispute, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s interest in obtaining convenient and effective relief, the interstate judicial system\xe2\x80\x99s interest in obtaining the most efficient resolution of controversies, and the shared interest of the several States in furthering fundamental substantive social policies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Viewed through this framework, the California courts appropriately exercised specific jurisdiction over respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, there is no dispute that Bristol-Myers \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avail[ed] itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Nicastro</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877, of California and its substantial pharmaceutical market.  Bristol-Myers employs over 400 people in California and maintains half a dozen facilities in the State engaged in research, development, and policymaking.  <i>Ante, </i>at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  It contracts with a California-based distributor, McKesson, whose sales account for a significant portion of its revenue.  <i>Supra,</i> at 2.  And it markets and sells its drugs, including Plavix, in California, resulting in total Plavix sales in that State of nearly $1 billion during the period relevant to this suit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims \xe2\x80\x9crelate to\xe2\x80\x9d Bristol-Myers\xe2\x80\x99 in-state conduct.  A claim \xe2\x80\x9crelates to\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s forum conduct if it has a \xe2\x80\x9cconnect[ion] with\xe2\x80\x9d that conduct.  <i>International Shoe</i>, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 319.  So respondents could not, for instance, hale Bristol-Myers into court in California for negligently maintaining the sidewalk outside its New York headquarters\xe2\x80\x94a claim that has no connection to acts Bristol-Myers took in California.  But respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims against Bristol-Myers look nothing like such a claim.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims against Bristol-Myers concern conduct materially identical to acts the company took in California: its marketing and distribution of Plavix, which it undertook on a nationwide basis in all 50 States.  That respondents were allegedly injured by this nationwide course of conduct in Indiana, Oklahoma, and Texas, and not California, does not mean that their claims do not \xe2\x80\x9crelate to\xe2\x80\x9d the advertising and distribution efforts that Bristol-Myers undertook in that State.  All of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94residents and nonresidents alike\xe2\x80\x94allege that they were injured by the same essential acts.  Our cases require no connection more direct than that.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, and importantly, there is no serious doubt that the exercise of jurisdiction over the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims is reasonable.  Because Bristol-Myers already faces claims that are identical to the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims in this suit, it will not be harmed by having to defend against respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims: Indeed, the alternative approach\xe2\x80\x94litigating those claims in separate suits in as many as 34 different States\xe2\x80\x94would prove far more burdensome.  By contrast, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in obtaining convenient and effective relief,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Burger King</i>, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 477 (internal quotation marks omitted), is obviously furthered by participating in a consolidated proceeding in one State under shared counsel, which allows them to minimize costs, share discovery, and maximize recoveries on claims that may be too small to bring on their own.  Cf. <i>American Express Co.</i> v. <i>Italian Colors Restaurant</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (Kagan., J., dissenting) (slip op., at 7) (\xe2\x80\x9cNo rational actor would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands\xe2\x80\x9d).  California, too, has an interest in providing a forum for mass actions like this one: Permitting the nonresidents to bring suit in California alongside the residents facilitates the efficient adjudication of the residents\xe2\x80\x99 claims and allows it to regulate more effectively the conduct of both nonresident corporations like Bristol-Myers and resident ones like McKesson.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nothing in the Due Process Clause prohibits a California court from hearing respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims\xe2\x80\x94at least not in a case where they are joined to identical claims brought by California residents.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Bristol-Myers does not dispute that it has purposefully availed itself of California\xe2\x80\x99s markets, nor\xe2\x80\x94remarkably\xe2\x80\x94did it argue below that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d for a California court to hear respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  See 1 Cal. 5th 783, 799, n.\xc2\xa02, 377 P. 3d 874, 885, n.\xc2\xa02 (2016).  Instead, Bristol-Myers contends that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims do not \xe2\x80\x9carise out of or relate to\xe2\x80\x9d its California conduct.  The majority agrees, explaining that no \xe2\x80\x9cadequate link\xe2\x80\x9d exists \xe2\x80\x9cbetween the State and the nonresidents\xe2\x80\x99 claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 8\xe2\x80\x94a result that it says follows from \xe2\x80\x9csettled principles [of] specific jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 7.  But our precedents do not require this result, and common sense says that it cannot be correct.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The majority casts its decision today as compelled by precedent.  <i>Ibid. </i>But our cases point in the other direction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority argues at length that the exercise of spe-cific jurisdiction in this case would conflict with our decision in <i>Walden</i> v. <i>Fiore</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014).  That is plainly not true.  <i>Walden</i> concerned the requirement that a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully avail\xe2\x80\x9d himself of a forum State or \xe2\x80\x9cpurposefully direc[t]\xe2\x80\x9d his conduct toward that State, <i>Nicastro</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877, not the separate requirement that a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim \xe2\x80\x9carise out of or relate to\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s forum contacts.  The lower court understood the case that way.  See <i>Fiore</i> v. <i>Walden</i>, 688 F.\xc2\xa03d 558, 576\xe2\x80\x93582 (CA9 2012).  The parties understood the case that way.  See Brief for Petitioner 17\xe2\x80\x9331, Brief for Respondent 20\xe2\x80\x9344, Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 12\xe2\x80\x9318, in <i>Walden</i> v. <i>Fiore</i>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2013, No. 12\xe2\x80\x93574.  And courts and commentators have understood the case that way.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> 4 Wright \xc2\xa71067.1, at 388\xe2\x80\x93389.  <i>Walden</i> teaches only that a defendant must have purposefully availed itself of the forum, and that a plaintiff cannot rely solely on a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with a forum resident to establish the necessary relationship.  See 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he plaintiff cannot be the only link between the defendant and the forum\xe2\x80\x9d).  But that holding has nothing to do with the dispute between the parties: Bristol-Myers has purposefully availed itself of California\xe2\x80\x94to the tune of millions of dollars in annual revenue.  Only if its language is taken out of context, <i>ante, </i>at 8\xe2\x80\x939, can <i>Walden</i> be made to seem relevant to the case at hand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By contrast, our decision in <i>Keeton</i> v. <i>Hustler Magazine, Inc.</i>,\n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 770 (1984)\n, suggests that there should be no such barrier to the exercise of jurisdiction here.  In <i>Keeton</i>, a New York resident brought suit against an Ohio corporation, a magazine, in New Hampshire for libel.  She alleged that the magazine\xe2\x80\x99s nationwide course of conduct\xe2\x80\x94its publication of defamatory statements\xe2\x80\x94had injured her in every State, including New Hampshire.  This Court unanimously rejected the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it should not be subject to \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide dam-ages\xe2\x80\x9d when only a small portion of those damages arose in the forum State, <i>id.,</i> at 781; exposure to such liability, the Court explained, was the consequence of having \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuously and deliberately exploited the New Hampshire market,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>  The majority today dismisses <i>Keeton</i> on the ground that the defendant there faced one plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim arising out of its nationwide course of conduct, whereas Bristol-Myers faces many more plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  See <i>ante, </i>at 10.  But this is a distinction without a difference: In either case, a defendant will face liability in a single State for a single course of conduct that has impact in many States.  <i>Keeton</i> informs us that there is no unfairness in such a result.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s animating concern, in the end, appears to be federalism: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]erritorial limitations on the power of the respective States,\xe2\x80\x9d we are informed, may\xe2\x80\x94and today do\xe2\x80\x94trump even concerns about fairness to the parties.  <i>Ante, </i>at 6.  Indeed, the majority appears to concede that this is not, at bottom, a case about fairness but instead a case about power: one in which \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the defendant would suffer minimal or no inconvenience from being forced to litigate before the tribunals of another State; .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the forum State has a strong interest in applying its law to the contro-versy; [and] the forum State is the most convenient location for litigation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but personal jurisdiction still will not lie.  <i>Ante, </i>at 7 (quoting <i>World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. </i>v<i>. Woodson,</i>\n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 286,\n294 (1980)\n).  But I see little reason to apply such a principle in a case brought against a large corporate defendant arising out of its nationwide conduct.  What interest could any single State have in adjudicating respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims that the other States do not share?  I would measure jurisdiction first and foremost by the yardstick set out in <i>International Shoe</i>\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cfair play and substantial justice,\xe2\x80\x9d 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 316 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion casts that settled principle aside.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I fear the consequences of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision today will be substantial.  Even absent a rigid requirement that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s in-state conduct must actually cause a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>] the upshot of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is that plaintiffs cannot join their claims together and sue a defendant in a State in which only some of them have been injured.  That rule is likely to have consequences far beyond this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, and most prominently, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in this case will make it profoundly difficult for plaintiffs who are injured in different States by a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s nationwide course of conduct to sue that defendant in a single, consolidated action.  The holding of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is that such an action cannot be brought in a State in which only some plaintiffs were injured.  Not to worry, says the majority: The plaintiffs here could have sued Bristol-Myers in New York or Delaware; could \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d have subdivided their separate claims into 34 lawsuits in the States in which they were injured; and might have been able to bring a single suit in federal court (an \xe2\x80\x9copen .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. question\xe2\x80\x9d).  <i>Ante, </i>at 12.  Even setting aside the majority\xe2\x80\x99s caveats, what is the purpose of such limitations?  What interests are served by preventing the consolidation of claims and limiting the forums in which they can be consolidated?  The effect of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today is to eliminate nationwide mass actions in any State other than those in which a defendant is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essentially at home.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  See <i>Daimler</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Such a rule hands one more tool to corporate defendants determined to prevent the aggregation of individual claims, and forces injured plaintiffs to bear the burden of bringing suit in what will often be far flung jurisdictions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today may make it impossible to bring certain mass actions at all.  After this case, it is difficult to imagine where it might be possible to bring a nationwide mass action against two or more defendants headquartered and incorporated in different States.  There will be no State where both defendants are \xe2\x80\x9cat home,\xe2\x80\x9d and so no State in which the suit can proceed.  What abouta nationwide mass action brought against a defendantnot headquartered or incorporated in the United States?  Such a defendant is not \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in any State.  Cf. <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18\xe2\x80\x9319).  Especially in a world in which defendants are subject to general jurisdiction in only a handful of States, see <i>ibid.</i>, the effect of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will be to curtail\xe2\x80\x94and in some cases eliminate\xe2\x80\x94plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to hold corporations fully accountable for their nationwide conduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority chides respondents for conjuring a \xe2\x80\x9cparade of horribles,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 12, but says nothing about how suits like those described here will survive its opinion in this case.  The answer is simple: They will not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">It \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not offend \xe2\x80\x98traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>International Shoe</i>, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 316, to permit plaintiffs to aggregate claims arising out of a single nationwide course of conduct in a single suit in a single State where some, but not all, were injured.
