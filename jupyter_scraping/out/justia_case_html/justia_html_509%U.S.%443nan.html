(TXO) commenced this litigation by filing a complaint in the Circuit Court of McDowell County, West Virginia, for a declaratory judgment removing a cloud on title to an interest in oil and gas development rights. Respondents, including Alliance Resources Corp. (Alliance), filed a counterclaim for slander of title that went to trial before a jury in June 1990. The jury verdict in respondents\' favor, which has been affirmed by the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia, makes it appropriate to accept respondents\' version of disputed issues of fact.</p><p>In 1984, geologists employed by TXO concluded that the recovery of oil and gas under the surface of a 1,002.74acre tract of land known as the "Blevins Tract" would be extremely profitable. They strongly recommended that TXO-a large company that was engaged in oil and gas production in 25 States-obtain the rights to develop the oil and gas resources on the Blevins Tract.</p><p>Those rights were then controlled by Alliance.1 Prodded by its geologists, TXO approached Alliance with what Alliance considered to be a "\'phenomenal offer.\'" 187 W. Va. 457, 462, 419 S. E. 2d 870, 875 (1992). TXO would pay Alliance $20 per acre in cash, pay 22 percent of the oil and gas revenues in royalties, and pay all of the development costs. On April 2, 1985, Alliance accepted TXO\'s offer, agreeing to assign its interest in the Tract to TXO. With respect to title to the property, Alliance agreed to return the consider-</p><p>1 Alliance was the assignee of a leasehold interest that respondents George King and Grover C. Goode, doing business as Georgia Fuels, had obtained from respondent Tug Fork Land Company.

Signaigo, Jr., who had later conveyed those rights to the Hawley Coal Mines Company, which had, in turn, reconveyed them to the Virginia Crews Coal Company (Virginia Crews). Interviews with Signaigo, and with representatives of Hawley and Virginia Crews, established that the parties all understood that only the right to mine coal had been involved in those transactions; none of them claimed any interest in oil or gas development rights. Moreover, the text of the 1958 deed made it "perfectly clear" that the grantor had reserved "all the oil and gas underlying" the Blevins Tract.3</p><p>TXO first advised Alliance of the "distinct possibility or probability" that its "leasehold title fails" in July 1985.4 In the meantime, despite its knowledge that any claim that the 1958 deed created a cloud on title to the oil and gas develop-</p><p>2 The agreement provided, in pertinent part:</p><p>"Assignor [Alliance] hereby warrants title to the extent that in the event of conducting title examination of the assigned acreage, Assignee\'s examining attorney determines that title has failed to all or any part of the assigned acreage, Assignor will reimburse to Assignee the consideration paid to it for any such lands to which title is determined to have failed." See 187 W. Va., at 463, n. 1, 419 S. E. 2d, at 876, n. 1.</p><p>3 The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals "unequivocally [found] that the deed was unambiguous," <i>id., </i>at 464, 419 S.

E. 2d, at 876-877 (emphasis in original). The entire deed is reprinted as Appendix A to the opinion of the State Supreme Court of Appeals.

First, after unsuccessfully trying to convince Virginia Crews that it had an interest in the oil and gas, TXO paid the company $6,000 for a quitclaim deed conveying whatever interest it might have to TXO. TXO recorded the deed without advising Alliance.6 Second, TXO unsuccessfully attempted to induce Mr. Signaigo to execute a false affidavit indicating that the 1958 deed might have included oil and gas rights.</p><p>On July 12, after having recorded the quitclaim deed, TXO wrote to Alliance asserting that there was a title objection and implying that TXO might well have acquired the oil and gas rights from Virginia Crews. It then arranged a meeting in August and attempted to renegotiate the royalty arrangement. When the negotiations were unsuccessful, TXO commenced this litigation. According to the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, TXO "knowingly and intentionally brought a frivolous declaratory judgment action" when its "real intent" was "to reduce the royalty payments under a 1,002.74 acre oil and gas lease," and thereby "increas[e] its interest in the oil and gas rights." 7</p><p>TXO\'s declaratory judgment action was decided on the basis of the parties\' written submissions. The court granted</p><p>5 In the words of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals: "In this case, TXO Production Corporation, a subsidiary of USX, knowingly and intentionally brought a frivolous declaratory judgment action against the appellees to clear a purported cloud on title." 187 W. Va., at 462, 419</p><p>6 According to an internal TXO memorandum, TXO viewed the quitclaim deed as offering "a chance of the court conferring TXO with 100% interest in the O[il] &amp; G[as] estate as opposed to having a 78% net lease if the court rules in favor of Tug Fork\'s title." Plaintiff\'s Exhibit No.8 (TXO Production Corp. Inter-Office Memorandum (May 30, 1985)). The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals referred to TXO\'s acquisition and recording of the quitclaim deed as nothing less than "an attempt to steal [Alliance\'s] land." 187 W. Va., at 468, 419 S.

In addition to the evidence that TXO knew that Alliance had good title to the oil and gas and that TXO had acted in bad faith when it advanced a claim on the basis of the worthless quitclaim deed in an effort to renegotiate its royalty arrangement, Alliance introduced evidence showing that TXO was a large company in its own right and a wholly owned subsidiary of an even larger company; 9 that the anticipated gross revenues from oil and gas development-and therefore the amount of royalties that TXO sought to renegotiate-were substantial; 10 and that TXO had</p><p>8"The Court further finds, as a matter of law, that TXO Production Corp. obtained no interest or title to the oil and gas underlying the 1,002.74 acres in question from Virginia Crews Coal Company by reason of the quit claim deed in question. The quit claim deed of Virginia Crews Coal Company conveyed no title to TXO Production Corp. because Virginia Crews Coal Company obtained no title to the oil and gas from Hawley Coal Mining Corporation and said quit claim deed is, therefore, a nullity." App. 18.</p><p>9Because TXO had refused to disclose any financial records in response to Alliance\'s discovery requests, Alliance employed an expert witness who analyzed public financial statements of TXO\'s parent, USX Corporation; he estimated that the TXO division of USX had a net worth of between "$2.2 billion and $2.5 billion." 187 W. Va., at 477, 419 S. E. 2d, at 890. Although TXO objected to the evidence as including assets of affiliates, it did not offer any rebuttal testimony on that issue. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>10 Respondents introduced expert testimony demonstrating that the Blevins Tract could support between 15 and 25 wells.

It is fair to infer that the punitive damages award of $10 million was based on other evidence.</p><p>In support of motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and for remittitur, TXO argued that the punitive damages award violated the Due Process Clause. Counsel contended that under the "general punitive damage instruction given in this case, the jury was left to their own devices without any yardstick as to what was a reasonable punitive damage award. And for that reason, a vagueness, lack of guideline and the lack of any requirement of a reasonable relationship between the actual injury and the punitive damage award, in essence, would cause the Court or should cause the Court to set it aside on Constitutional grounds." 11 In response, counsel for Alliance argued that the constitutional objection had been waived, that the misconduct was particularly egregious,12 and that the award was not excessive.</p><p>Mcf. Trial testimony demonstrated that TXO was optimistic that the Blevins Tract would be quite profitable. See Tr. 672-673 (testimony of TXO official that the Blevins Tract was a good prospect, that it presented a "reasonably good opportunity," and that it offered the potential for the development of numerous wells).</p><p>Putting these figures together, respondents contend that TXO anticipated revenues of as high as $1.5 million for each well developed on the Tract. Brief for Respondents 3.

Nonetheless, we find neither formulation satisfactory. Under respondents\' rational-basis standard, apparently <i>any </i>award that would serve the legitimate state interest in deterring or punishing wrongful conduct, no matter how large, would be acceptable. On the other hand, we reject the premise underlying TXO\'s invocation of heightened scrutiny. The review of a jury\'s award for arbitrariness and the review of legislation surely are significantly different. Still, it is not correct to assume that the safeguards in the legislative process have no counterpart in the judicial process. The members of the jury were determined to be impartial before they were allowed to sit, their assessment of damages was the product of collective deliberation based</p><p>21 As counsel for petitioner noted at oral argument, these objective criteria in part track the analysis of Justice Powell\'s opinion for the Court in <i>Solem </i>v. <i>Helm, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/277/case.html">463 U.

Assuming that fair procedures were followed, a judgment that is a product of that process is entitled to a strong presumption of validity. Indeed, there are persuasive reasons for suggesting that the presumption should be irrebuttable, see <i>Haslip, </i>499 U. S., at 24-40 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment), or virtually so, <i>id., </i>at 40-42 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).</p><p>Nor are we persuaded that reliance on petitioner\'s "objective" criteria is the proper course to follow. We have, of course, relied on history and "widely shared practice" as a guide to determining whether a particular state practice so departs from an accepted norm as to be presumptively violative of due process, see <i>Schad, </i>501 U. S., at 637-643 (plurality opinion), and whether a term of imprisonment under certain circumstances is cruel and unusual punishment, see So <i>lem </i>v. <i>Helm, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/277/case.html">463 U.

We question, however, the utility of such a comparative approach <i>as a test </i>for assessing whether a particular punitive award is presumptively unconstitutional.</p><p>It is a relatively straightforward task to draw intrajurisdictional and interjurisdictional comparisons on such matters as the definition of first-degree murder <i>(Schad) </i>or the penalty imposed on nonviolent repeat offenders <i>(Solem). </i>The same cannot be said of the task of drawing such comparisons with regard to punitive damages awards by juries. Such awards are the product of numerous, and sometimes intangible, factors; a jury imposing a punitive damages award must make a qualitative assessment based on a host of facts and circumstances unique to the particular case before it. Because no two cases are truly identical, meaningful comparisons of such awards are difficult to make. Cf. <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 41-42 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment).

Thus, while we do not rule out the possibility that the fact that an award is significantly larger than those in apparently similar circumstances might, in a given case, be one of many relevant considerations, we are not prepared to enshrine petitioner\'s comparative approach in a "test" for assessing the constitutionality of punitive damages awards.</p><p>In the end, then, in determining whether a particular award is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, <i>Waters-Pierce Oil </i><i>Co., </i>212 U. S., at 111, we return to what we said two Terms ago in <i>Haslip: </i>"We need not, and indeed we cannot, draw a mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable that would fit every case. We can say, however, that [a] general concer[n] of reasonableness ... properly enter[s] into the constitutional calculus." 499 U. S., at 18. And, to echo <i>Haslip </i>once again, it is with this concern for reasonableness in mind that we turn to petitioner\'s argument that the punitive award in this case was so "grossly excessive" as to violate the substantive component of the Due Process Clause.24</p><p>23 Of course, such a state policy would likely be subject to challenge on other grounds as well.</p><p>24JUSTICE SCALIA\'S assertion notwithstanding, see <i>post, </i>at 471, we do not suggest that a defendant has a substantive due process right to a correct determination of the "reasonableness" of a punitive damages award. As JUSTICE O\'CONNOR points out, state law generally imposes a requirement that punitive damages be "reasonable." See <i>post, </i>at 475479. A violation of a state law "reasonableness" requirement would not, however, necessarily establish that the award is so "grossly excessive" as to violate the Federal Constitution. Furthermore, the fact that our cases have recognized for almost a century that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment imposes an outer limit on such an award does not,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="459">459</a></p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>In support of its submission that this award is "grossly excessive," TXO places its primary emphasis on the fact that it is over 526 times as large as the actual damages award. TXO correctly notes that state courts have long held that "exemplary damages allowed should bear some proportion to the real damage sustained." 25 Moreover, in our recent decision in <i>Has lip, supra, </i>in which we upheld a punitive damages award of four times the amount of compensatory damages, we noted that that award "may be close to the line" of constitutional permissibility. <i>Id., </i>at 23. Following that decision, the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals had also observed that as "a matter of fundamental fairness, punitive damages should bear a reasonable relationship to compensatory damages." <i>Garnes </i>v. <i>Fleming Landfill, Inc., 186 </i>W. Va., at 668, 413 S. E. 2d, at 909.</p><p>That relationship, however, was only one of several factors that the state court mentioned in its <i>Garnes </i>opinion. Earlier in its opinion it gave this example:</p><blockquote><p>\n"For instance, a man wildly fires a gun into a crowd.

We</p></blockquote><p>of course, make that Clause "the secret repository of all sorts of other, unenumerated, substantive rights," <i>post, </i>at 470 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Indeed, it is ironic that JUSTICE SCALIA acknowledges that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates substantive guarantees of the Bill of Rights while relying on the enumeration of one of those rights (the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment) as evidence that such a right has no counterpart in the Due Process Clause. <i>Post, </i>at 470-471.</p><p>25Grant v.

It said:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Punitive damages should bear a reasonable relationship to the harm <i>that is likely to occur from the defendant\'s conduct </i>as well as to the harm that actually has occurred. If the defendant\'s actions caused <i>or would likely cause </i>in a similar situation only slight harm, the damages should be relatively small.

E. 2d, at 909 (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>Taking account of the potential harm that might result from the defendant\'s conduct in calculating punitive damages was consistent with the views we expressed in <i>Has lip, supra. </i>In that case we endorsed the standards that the Alabama Supreme Court had previously announced, one of which was "whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and <i>the harm likely to result </i>from the defendant\'s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred," <i>id., </i>at 21 (emphasis added).</p><p>Thus, both State Supreme Courts and this Court have eschewed an approach that concentrates entirely on the relationship between actual and punitive damages. It is appropriate to consider the magnitude of the <i>potential harm </i>that the defendant\'s conduct would have caused to its intended victim if the wrongful plan had succeeded, as well as the possible harm to other victims that might have resulted if similar future behavior were not deterred.

In fact, in making their closing arguments to the jury, counsel for respondents stressed, in addition to TXO\'s vast wealth, the tremendous financial gains that TXO hoped to achieve through its "elaborate scheme." Counsel for Alliance argued:</p><blockquote><p>\n"They wouldn\'t have gone to this elaborate scheme-No, they wouldn\'t now, because they thought this was a huge, gonna be a huge money-making lease. Gonna puts lots of wells on it. That\'s why it was worth the scheme. And the punishment should fit it, and fit the wealth." App. to Brief for Petitioner 23a.</p></blockquote><p>Echoing the same theme, counsel for respondent Tug Fork Land Company argued:</p><blockquote><p>\n"You have to go on what TXO thought when they were going into this well. They thought it was going to be a better well than it was. But, see, it got caught up in this litigation and now, I submit to you, they are saying that it is not as good a well as it was. And that\'s a fact that is in some contention here. But regardless of how good it was, when they went in and did their operation back in May, June, July and August of 1985, they had projected that this would be a 20 year well and would produce a lot of money."

It authorized the jury to take account of "the wealth of the perpetrator" in recognition of the fact that effective deterrence of wrongful conduct "may require a larger fine upon one of large means than it would upon one of ordinary means under the same or similar circumstances." 29 It also stated that one of the purposes of punitive damages is "to provide additional compensation for</p><p>29The instruction on punitive damages, to which TXO objected, read as follows:</p><p>"In addition to actual or compensatory damages, the law permits the jury, under certain circumstances, to make an award of punitive damages, in order to punish the wrongdoer for his misconduct, to serve as an example or warning to others not to engage in such conduct and to provide additional compensation for the conduct to which the injured parties have been subjected.</p><p>"If you find from a preponderance of the evidence that TXO Production Corp. is guilty of wanton, wilful, malicious or reckless conduct which shows an indifference to the right of others, then you may make an award of punitive damages in this case.</p><p>"In assessing punitive damages, if any, you should take into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the particular occurrence, including the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the intent of the party committing the act, the wealth of the perpetrator, as well as any mitigating circumstances which may operate to reduce the amount of the damages. The object of such punishment is to deter TXO Production Corp. and others from committing like offenses in the future.

That those terms played little, if any, part in its actual evaluation of the propriety of the damages award is evident from the reasoning in its thorough opinion, succinctly summarized in passages we have already quoted. Moreover, two members of the court who wrote separately to disassociate themselves from the "really mean" and "really stupid" terminology shared the views of the rest of the members of the court on the merits.

I am not in full agreement, however, with the plurality\'s discussion of the substantive requirements of the Due Process Clause in Parts II and III, in which it concentrates on whether the punitive damages award was "\'grossly excessive.\'\'\' <i>Ante, </i>at 458, 462. I agree that the approaches proposed by the parties to this case are unsatisfactory, see <i>ante, </i>at 456-458, but I do not believe that the plurality\'s replacement, a general focus on the "\'reasonableness\'" of the award, <i>ante, </i>at 458, quoting <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Haslip, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/1/case.html">499 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1991), is a significant improvement. To ask whether a particular award of punitive damages is grossly excessive begs the question: excessive in relation to what? The answer excessive in relation to the conduct of the tortfeasor may be correct, but it is unhelpful, for we are still bereft of any standard by which to compare the punishment to the malefaction that gave rise to it. A reviewing court employing this formulation comes close to relying upon nothing more than its own subjective reaction to a particular punitive</p><p>satory damages before it can award punitive damages.

This type of review, far from imposing meaningful, law-like restraints on jury excess, could become as fickle as the process it is designed to superintend. Furthermore, it might give the illusion of judicial certainty where none in fact exists, and, in so doing, discourage legislative intervention that might prevent unjust punitive awards.</p><p>As I have suggested before, see <i>id., </i>at 41 (opinion concurring in judgment), a more manageable constitutional inquiry focuses not on the amount of money a jury awards in a particular case but on its reasons for doing so. The Constitution identifies no particular multiple of compensatory damages as an acceptable limit for punitive awards; it does not concern itself with dollar amounts, ratios, or the quirks of juries in specific jurisdictions. Rather, its fundamental guarantee is that the individual citizen may rest secure against arbitrary or irrational deprivations of property. When a punitive damages award reflects bias, passion, or prejudice on the part of the jury, rather than a rational concern for deterrence and retribution, the Constitution has been violated, no matter what the absolute or relative size of the award. JUSTICE O\'CONNOR is correct in observing that in implementing this principle, courts have often looked to the size of the award as one indication that it resulted from bias, passion, or prejudice, see <i>post, </i>at 476-478, but that is not the sole, or even necessarily the most important, sign. Other objective indicia of the type discussed by the plurality, see <i>ante, </i>at 455-457, as well as direct evidence from the trial record, are also helpful in ascertaining whether a jury stripped a party of its property in an arbitrary way and not in accordance with the standards of rationality and fairness the Constitution requires.</p><p>The plurality suggests that the jury in this case acted in conformance with these standards of rationality in large part on the basis of what it perceives to be the rational relation</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="468">468</a></p><p align="center">\nOpinion of KENNEDY, J.</p><p>between the size of the award and the degree of harm threatened by TXO\'s conduct. See <i>ante, </i>at 460-462. I do not agree that this provides a constitutionally adequate foundation for concluding that the punitive damages verdict against TXO was rational. It is a commonplace that a jury verdict must be reviewed in relation to the record before it. See, <i>e. g., Jackson </i>v. <i>Virginia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/307/case.html">443 U. S. 307</a> (1979). Unlike a legislature, whose judgments may be predicated on educated guesses and need not necessarily be grounded in facts adduced in a hearing, see, <i>e. g., Heller </i>v. <i>Doe, ante, </i>at 320; <i>FCC </i>v. <i>Beach Communications, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/508/307/case.html">508 U. S. 307</a>, 315 (1993); <i>Vance </i>v. <i>Bradley, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/440/93/case.html">440 U. S. 93</a>, 111 (1979), a jury is bound to consider only the evidence presented to it in arriving at a judgment. JUSTICE O\'CONNOR demonstrates that the record in this case does not contain evidence, argument, or instructions regarding the potential harm from TXO\'s conduct and so would not have permitted a reasonable jury to render its verdict on this basis. See <i>post, </i>at 484-489. We must therefore look for other explanations of the jury verdict to decide whether it may stand.</p><p>On its facts, this case is close and difficult; JUSTICE O\'CONNOR makes a plausible argument, based on the record and the trial court\'s instructions, that the size of the punitive award is explained by the jury\'s raw, redistributionist impulses stemming from antipathy to a wealthy, outof-state, corporate defendant. See <i>post, </i>at 492-494. There is, however, another explanation for the jury verdict, one supported by the record and relied upon by the state courts, that persuades me that I cannot say with sufficient confidence that the award was unjustified or improper on this record: TXO acted with malice. This was not a case of negligence, strict liability, or <i>respondeat superior. </i>TXO was found to have committed, through its senior officers, the intentional tort of slander of title. The evidence at trial demonstrated that it acted, in the West Virginia Supreme</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="469">469</a></p><p>Court of Appeals\' words, through a "pattern and practice of fraud, trickery and deceit" and employed "unsavory and malicious practices" in the course of its business dealings with respondent. 187 W. Va. 457, 477, 467, 419 S. E. 2d 870, 890, 880 (1992). "[T]he record shows that this was not an isolated incident on TXO\'s part-a mere excess of zeal by poorly supervised, low level employees-but rather part of a pattern and practice by TXO to defraud and coerce those in positions of unequal bargaining power." <i>Id., </i>at 468, 419</p><p>Although in many respects this case represents an odd application of an already unusual tort, it was rational for the jury to place great weight on the evidence of TXO\'s deliberate, wrongful conduct in determining that a substantial award was required in order to serve the goals of punishment and deterrence. I confess to feeling a certain degree of disquiet in affirming this award, but the record, when viewed as a whole, makes it probable that the jury\'s verdict was motivated by a legitimate concern for punishing and deterring TXO, rather than by bias, passion, or prejudice. There was ample evidence of willful and malicious conduct by TXO in this case; the jury heard evidence concerning several prior lawsuits filed against TXO accusing it of similar misdeeds; and respondents\' attorneys informed the jury of TXO\'s vast financial resources and argued that TXO would suffer only as a result of a large judgment. Compared with this evidence and argumentation, which dominates the record of the trial, the subtler and more isolated appeals based on TXO\'s out-of-state status on which JUSTICE O\'CONNOR focuses were of lesser importance. A case involving vicarious liability, negligence, or strict liability might present different issues. But given the record here, I am satisfied that the jury\'s punitive damages award did not amount to an unfair, arbitrary, or irrational seizure of TXO\'s property.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="470">470</a></p><p>SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment</p><p>JUSTICE SCALIA, with whom JUSTICE THOMAS joins, concurring in the judgment.</p><p>The jury in this case was instructed on the purposes of punitive damages under West Virginia law, and its award was reviewed for reasonableness by the trial court and the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Traditional American practice governing the imposition of punitive damages requires no more. See <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Haslip, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/1/case.html">499 U. S. 1</a>, 15 (1991); <i>id., </i>at 26-27 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). It follows, in my view, that petitioner\'s claims under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment must fail. See <i>id., </i>at 31. I therefore have no difficulty joining the Court\'s judgment.</p><p>I do not, however, join the plurality opinion, since it makes explicit what was implicit in <i>Haslip: </i>the existence of a socalled "substantive due process" right that punitive damages be reasonable, see <i>ante, </i>at 458.* I am willing to accept the proposition that the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, despite its textual limitation to procedure, incorporates certain substantive guarantees specified in the Bill of Rights; but I do not accept the proposition that it is the secret repository of all sorts of other, unenumerated, substantive rights-however fashionable that proposition may have been (even as to economic rights of the sort involved here) at the time of the <i>Lochner-era </i>cases the plural-</p><p>*JUSTICE STEVENS asserts that there is a difference between the constitutional standard that he today proposes, which he describes as "grossly excessive" (a term used in one of the <i>Lochner-era </i>cases he relies upon, <i>Waters-Pierce Oil Co. </i>v. <i>Texas (No.1), </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/212/86/case.html">212 U. S. 86</a>, 111 (1909)), and the standard of "reasonableness" that state courts have traditionally applied. <i>Ante, </i>at 458-459, n. 24. I doubt whether there is a difference between the two. As JUSTICE O\'CONNOR points out, see <i>post, </i>at 476-478, state courts often used terms like "grossly excessive" to describe the sort of award that could not stand. But if there <i>is </i>a difference, then one must wonder-since it is not based upon any common-law traditionwhere the standard of "grossly-excessive-that-means-something-evenworse-than-unreasonable" comes from.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="471">471</a></p><p>ity relies upon, see <i>ante, </i>at 453-454. It is particularly difficult to imagine that "due process" contains the substantive right not to be subjected to excessive punitive damages, since if it contains <i>that </i>it would surely also contain the substantive right not to be subjected to excessive fines, which would make the Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment superfluous in light of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p><p>To say (as I do) that "procedural due process" requires judicial review of punitive damages awards for reasonableness is not to say that there is a federal constitutional right to a substantively correct "reasonableness" determinationwhich is, in my view, what the plurality tries to assure today. Procedural due process also requires, I am certain, judicial review of the sufficiency of the evidence to sustain a civil jury verdict, and judicial review of the reasonableness of jury-awarded compensatory damages (including damages for pain and suffering); but no one would claim (or at least no one has yet claimed) that a substantively correct determination of sufficiency of evidence and reasonableness of compensatory damages is a federal constitutional right. So too, I think, with punitive damages: <i>Judicial </i>assessment of their reasonableness is a federal right, but a <i>correct </i>assessment of their reasonableness is not.</p><p>Today\'s reprise of <i>Has lip, </i>despite the widely divergent opinions it has produced, has not been a waste. The procedures approved here, <i>ante, </i>at 463-466 (plurality opinion), are far less detailed and restrictive than those upheld in <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 19-23, suggesting that if the Court ever does invent new procedural requirements, they will not deviate significantly from the traditional ones that ought to govern. And the disposition of the "substantive due process" claim demonstrates that the Court\'s" \'constitutional sensibilities\'" are far more resistant to " \'jar[ring],\'" <i>ante, </i>at 462 (plurality opinion) (quoting <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 18), than one might have imagined after <i>Haslip. </i>There the Court said a 4-to-l ratio</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="472">472</a></p><p>between punitive damages and actual damages "may be close to the line" of "constitutional impropriety," <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 23-24; today we decide that a <i>10-to-1 </i>ratio between punitive damages and <i>the potential harm of petitioner\'s conduct </i>passes muster-calculating that potential harm, very generously, to be more than <i>50 </i>times the $19,000 in actual damages that respondents suffered, see <i>ante, </i>at 460-462 (plurality opinion).</p><p>The plurality\'s decision is valuable, then, in that the great majority of due process challenges to punitive damages awards can henceforth be disposed of simply with the observation that "this is no worse than <i>TXO." </i>I would go further, to shut the door the plurality leaves slightly ajar. As I said in <i>Has lip, </i>the Constitution gives federal courts no business in this area, except to assure that due process (i. <i>e., </i>traditional procedure) has been observed. 499 U. S., at 27-28 (opinion concurring in judgment). State legislatures and courts have ample authority to eliminate any perceived "unfairness" in the common-law punitive damages regime, and have frequently exercised that authority in recent years. See <i>id., </i>at 39; Brief for Attorney General of Alabama et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>14-17 (collecting state statutes and cases); Brief for National Association of Securities and Commercial Law Attorneys as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>16-30 (same). The plurality\'s continued assertion that federal judges have <i>some, </i>almost-never-usable, power to impose a standard of "reasonable punitive damages" through the clumsy medium of the Due Process Clause serves only to spawn wasteful litigation, and to reduce the incentives for the proper institutions of our society to undertake that task.</p><p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, with whom JUSTICE WHITE joins, and with whom JUSTICE SOUTER joins as to Parts II-B-2, II-C, III, and IV, dissenting.</p><p>In <i>Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. </i>v. <i>Has lip, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/499/1/case.html">499 U.

Today the Court\'s judgment renders <i>Haslip\'s </i>promise a false one. The procedures that converted this commercial dispute into a $10 million punitive verdict were wholly inadequate. Rather than producing a judgment founded on verifiable criteria, they produced a monstrous award-526 times actual damages and over 20 times greater than any punitive award in West Virginia history. Worse, the State Supreme Court of Appeals rejected petitioner\'s challenge with only cursory analysis, observing that petitioner, rather than being "really stupid," had been "really mean." 187 W. Va. 457, 474-475, 419 S. E. 2d 870, 887-889 (1992). The court similarly refused to consider the possibility of remittitur because petitioner "and its agents and servants failed to conduct themselves as gentlemen." <i>Id., </i>at 462, 419 S. E. 2d, at 875. In my view, due process does not tolerate such cavalier standards when so much is at stake. Because I believe that neither this award\'s size nor the procedures that produced it are consistent with the principles this Court articulated in <i>Haslip, </i>I respectfully dissent.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Our system of justice entrusts jurors-ordinary citizens who need not have any training in the law-with profoundly important determinations. Jurors decide not only civil matters, where the financial consequences may be great, but also criminal cases, where the liberty or perhaps life of the defendant hangs in the balance. Our abiding faith in the jury system is founded on longstanding tradition reflected in constitutional text, see U. S. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2, Amdts. 6, 7, and is supported by sound considerations of justice and democratic theory. The jury system long has been a guarantor of fairness, a bulwark against tyranny, and a source of civic values. See 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *379-*381; <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 40 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment);</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="474">474</a></p><p>w.

Simon ed. 1975).</p><p>But jurors are not infallible guardians of the public good.</p><p>They are ordinary citizens whose decisions can be shaped by influences impermissible in our system of justice. In fact, they are more susceptible to such influences than judges. See H. Kalven &amp; H. Zeisel, The American Jury 497-498 (1966) ("The judge very often perceives the stimulus that moves the jury, but does not yield to it .... The perennial amateur, layman jury cannot be so quickly domesticated to official role and tradition; it remains accessible to stimuli which the judge will exclude"). Arbitrariness, caprice, passion, bias, and even malice can replace reasoned judgment and law as the basis for jury decisionmaking. Modern judicial systems therefore incorporate safeguards against such influences. Rules of evidence limit what the parties may present to the jury. Careful instructions direct the jury\'s deliberations. Trial judges diligently supervise proceedings, watchful for potential sources of error. And courts of appeals stand ready to overturn judgments when efforts to ensure fairness have failed.</p><p>In the usual case, this elaborate but necessary judicial machinery functions well, ensuring that our jury system is an engine of liberty and justice rather than a source of oppression and arbitrary imposition. As JUSTICE KENNEDY has explained, "[e]lements of whim and caprice do not predominate when the jury reaches a consensus based upon arguments of counsel, the presentation of evidence, and instructions from the trial judge, subject to review by the trial and appellate courts." <i>Has lip, </i>499 U. S., at 40 (opinion concurring in judgment). But the risk of prejudice, bias, and caprice remains a real one in every case nonetheless.</p><p>This is especially true in the area of punitive damages, where juries sometimes receive only vague and amorphous guidance. Jurors may be told that punitive damages are im-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="475">475</a></p><p>posed to punish and deter, but rarely are they instructed on how to effectuate those goals or whether any limiting principles exist. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>id., at 39. Although this Court has not held such instructions constitutionally inadequate, it cannot be denied that the lack of clear guidance heightens the risk that arbitrariness, passion, or bias will replace dispassionate deliberation as the basis for the jury\'s verdict. See <i>id., </i>at 43, 63 (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting); <i>id., </i>at 41 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) ("[T]he generality of the instructions may contribute to a certain lack of predictability"); <i>Browning-Ferris Industries of Vt., Inc. </i>v. <i>Kelco Disposal, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/257/case.html">492 U.

As one commentator has explained:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Like everyone else in the court system, juries need and deserve objective rules for decision.

S. 323</a>, 350 (1974) ("[J]uries assess punitive damages in wholly unpredictable amounts bearing no necessary relation to the actual harm caused").</p><p>Influences such as caprice, passion, bias, and prejudice are antithetical to the rule of law.

See <i>Haslip, supra, </i>at 41 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment) ("A verdict returned by a biased or prejudiced jury no doubt violates due process"). Of course, determining whether a verdict resulted from improper influences is no easy matter. By tradition and necessity, the circumstances in which jurors may impeach their own verdict are quite limited. See <i>Tanner </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/107/case.html">483 U. S. 107</a>, 117-121, 127 (1987); 11 C. Wright &amp; A.

But fundamental fairness requires that impermissible influences such as bias and prejudice be discovered nonetheless, by inference if not by direct proof. As a result, courts at common law in England traditionally would strike any award that appeared so grossly disproportionate as to evidence caprice, passion, or bias.1 This practice long has been followed</p><p>1 See <i>Hewlett </i>v. <i>Cruchley, </i>5 Taunt. 277, 281, 128 Eng.

It is thus common ground that an award may be so excessive as to violate due process. <i>Ibid. </i>We part company, however, on how to determine if this is such an award.</p><p>In Solomonic fashion, the plurality rejects both petitioner\'s and respondents\' proffered approaches, instead selecting a seemingly moderate course. See <i>ante, </i>at 456-458. But the course the plurality chooses is, in fact, no course at all. The plurality opinion erects not a single guidepost to help other courts find their way through this area. Rather, quoting <i>Haslip\'s </i>observation that there is no "\'mathematical bright line between the constitutionally acceptable and the constitutionally unacceptable,\'" <i>ante, </i>at 458 (quoting 499 U. S., at 18), the plurality abandons all pretense of providing instruction and moves directly into the specifics of this case.</p><p>I believe that the plurality errs not only in its result but also in its approach. Our inability to discern a mathematical formula does not liberate us altogether from our duty to provide guidance to courts that, unlike this one, must address jury verdicts such as this on a regular basis. On the contrary, the difficulty of the matter imposes upon us a correspondingly greater obligation to provide the most coherent explanation we can. I agree with the plurality that we ought not adopt TXO\'s or respondents\' suggested approach as a rigid formula for determining the constitutionality of punitive damages verdicts. But it does not follow that, in the course of deciding this case, we should avoid offering even a clue as to our own.</p><p>TXO\'s suggestion that this Court should rely on objective criteria has much to commend it. As an initial matter, constitutional judgments "\'should not be, or appear to be, merely the subjective views of individual Justices.\'\'\' <i>Rum</i>mel v. <i>Estelle, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/263/case.html">445 U. S. 263</a>, 274 (1980) (quoting <i>Coker </i>v. <i>Georgia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html">433 U. S. 584</a>, 592 (1977) (opinion of WHITE, J.)).

S., at 274-275 (quoting same). As the plurality points out, <i>ante, </i>at 455-456, TXO directs our attention to various objective indicators, including the relationship between the punitive damages award and compensatory damages, awards of punitive damages upheld against other defendants in the same jurisdiction, awards upheld for similar torts in other jurisdictions, and legislatively designated penalties for similar misconduct. While these factors by no means exhaust the due process inquiry, they are quite probative. It is to their proper application that I now turn.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>In my view, due process at least requires judges to engage in searching review where the verdict discloses such great disproportions as to suggest the possibility of bias, caprice, or passion. As JUSTICE STEVENS observed in a different context, "[o]ne need not use Justice Stewart\'s classic definition of obscenity-\'I know it when I see it\' -as an ultimate standard for judging" the constitutionality of a punitive damages verdict "to recognize that the dramatically irregular" size and nature of an award "may have sufficient probative force to call for an explanation." Cf. <i>Karcher </i>v. <i>Daggett, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/case.html">462 U. S. 725</a>, 755 (1983) (concurring opinion) (footnotes omitted).</p><p>This $10 million punitive award, returned in a case involving only $19,000 in compensatory damages, is a dramatically irregular, if not shocking, verdict by any measure. At the very least it should raise a suspicious judicial eyebrow. Not only does the punitive award represent over 500 times actual damages, but it also exceeds economic harm by over $9.98 million. Thus, it cannot be accepted as bearing the "understandable relationship to compensatory damages," 499 U. S., at 22, the Court found sufficient in <i>Haslip. </i>Indeed, in <i>Has-</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="482">482</a></p><p><i>lip </i>the Court observed that an $840,000 punitive award, representing four times compensatory damages, may have been "close to the line" of "constitutional impropriety." <i>Id., </i>at 23-24. If the quadruple damages, $840,000 award in <i>Haslip </i>was "close to the line," absent a convincing explanation, this $10 million award-over 500 times actual damages-surely must cross it.</p><p>A comparison of this award and prior ones in West Virginia confirms its unusual nature: It is 20 times larger than the highest punitive damages award <i>ever </i>upheld in West Virginia history for any misconduct. See App. to Brief for Petitioner 1a-3a (listing punitive damages awards affirmed on appeal in West Virginia). That figure is particularly surprising if one considers the nature of the offense at issue. This is not a case involving grave physical injury imposed on a helpless citizen by a callous malefactor. Rather, it is a business dispute between two companies in the oil and gas industry. TXO was accused of slandering respondents\' title to a tract of land-that is, impugning their claim of ownership-in an attempt to win concessions on a pre-existing contract. Although TXO\'s conduct was clearly wrongful, calculated, and improper, the award in this case cannot be upheld as a reasoned retributive response. Not only is it greatly in excess of the actual harm caused, but it is 10 times greater than the largest punitive damages award for the same tort in any jurisdiction, <i>id., </i>at 5a-8a (listing all recorded punitive damages awards for slander of title affirmed on appeal), and orders of magnitude larger than authorized civil and criminal penalties for similar offenses, see Brief for Petitioner 19, nn. 17-18, and App. to Brief for Petitioner 9a-21a (collecting statutes). By any "objective criteria," <i>Haslip, </i>499 U. S., at 23, the award is "grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense" and bears no "understandable relationship to compensatory damages," <i>id., </i>at 22. It is, at first blush, an "extreme resul[t] that jar[s] one\'s constitutional sensibilities." <i>Id., </i>at 18.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="483">483</a></p><p>That these disproportions might implicate due process concerns the plurality does not deny. Nonetheless, it refuses to "enshrine petitioner\'s comparative approach in a \'test\' for assessing the constitutionality of punitive damages awards." <i>Ante, </i>at 458. I agree with the plurality that, although it might be convenient to establish a multipart test and impose it upon the States, the principles of federalism counsel against such a course. The States should be permitted to "experiment with different methods" of ferreting out impermissible awards "and to adjust these methods over time." <i>Has lip, supra, </i>at 64 (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting). Nonetheless, I see no reason why this Court or any other would wish to disregard such probative evidence. For example, although retribution is a permissible consideration in assessing punitive damages awards, it is quite difficult to determine whether a particular award can be attributed to that goal; retribution resists quantification. Nonetheless, jury awards in similar cases and the civil and criminal penalties created by the legislature for like conduct can give us some idea of the limits on retribution. Thus, a $5,000 punitive damages award on actual damages of $1 may not seem well proportioned at first blush; but if the legislature has seen fit to impose a $50,000 penalty for that very same conduct, the award might be deemed a reasoned retributive response.</p><p>This approach, of course, has its limits. Because no two cases are alike, not all comparisons will be enlightening. See <i>ante, </i>at 457-458 (plurality opinion). But recognizing the limits of an approach does not compel us to discard it entirely. I do not see what can be gained by blinding ourselves to the few clear guideposts in an area so painfully bereft of objective criteria. Indeed, JUSTICE STEVENS joined in proposing precisely such an approach to punitive damages under the Eighth Amendment in <i>Browning-Ferris, </i>see 492 U. S., at 301 (O\'CONNOR, J., joined by STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part). Moreover, courts at common law engaged in similar comparisons. See, <i>e. g., Travis </i>v. <i>Barger,</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="484">484</a></p><p align="center">\nO\'CONNOR, J., dissenting</p><p>24 Barb. 614, 629 (N. Y. 1857) (comparing verdicts for similar torts); <i>International </i>&amp; <i>Great Northern R. Co. </i>v. <i>Telephone </i>&amp; <i>Telegraph Co., </i>69 Tex. 277, 282, 5 S. W. 517, 518 (1887) (comparing ratios). In any event, what the comparisons demonstrate in this case is what one might have suspected from the beginning. This award cannot be justified as a reasoned retributive response, for it is notably out of line with the punishment previously imposed by juries or established by statute for similar conduct.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>That, however, does not end our inquiry. In some cases, the unusual nature of the award will be explained by the peculiar considerations placed before the jury. Indeed, the plurality asserts that such an explanation exists in this case. The award, the plurality explains, may have been based on the profit TXO anticipated or the harm TXO would have imposed on respondents had its scheme been successful. <i>Ante, </i>at 459-462.</p><p>I have no quarrel with the plurality that, in the abstract, punitive damages may be predicated on the potential but unrealized harm to the victim, or even on the defendant\'s anticipated gain. Linking the punitive award to those factors not only substantially furthers the State\'s weighty interests in deterrence and retribution, but also can be traced well back in the common law. See, <i>e. g., Benson </i>v. <i>Frederick, </i>3 Burr. 1846, 97 Eng. Rep. 1130 (K. B. 1766) (Wilmot, J.) (damages for ordering the plaintiff flogged by two drummers not excessive even though disproportionate to plaintiff\'s actual suffering, as "it was rather owing to the lenity of the drummers than of the [defendant] that the [plaintiff] did not suffer <i>more"). </i>The plurality\'s theory, however, bears little relationship to what actually happened in this case.</p><p align="center">\n1</p><p>The record demonstrates that the potential harm theory is little more than an after-the-fact rationalization invented by</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="485">485</a></p><p>counsel to defend this startling award on appeal. The $5 to $8.3 million estimate of potential loss that respondents proffer today appears nowhere in the record. No expert or lay witness testified to the jury about any such figure. No one directed the jury\'s attention to the technical documents or scattered testimony on which respondents now rely. See <i>ante, </i>at 450-451, n. 10 (plurality opinion). No one told the jury how to pull all those numbers together to calculate such a figure. In fact, the jury never was told that it was permitted to do so.</p><p>Respondents did not even present their $5 to $8.3 million estimate to defend the verdict before the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. Nor did that court rely on such an estimate. Its opinion, which the plurality applauds as "thorough," <i>ante, </i>at 465, nowhere suggests that the jury might have based the award on the potential harm to respondents or on TXO\'s anticipated profit. Rather, its sole reference to potential harm is the "millions of dollars of damages" that might result if TXO <i>repeated </i>its misdeeds against <i>"other victims." </i>187 W. Va., at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889 (emphasis added). Virtually any tort, however, can cause millions of dollars of harm if imposed against a sufficient number of victims.</p><p>Respondents\' $5 to $8.3 million estimate appeared for the first time after this Court granted certiorari, having been produced exclusively for our consumption. As the plurality notes, there is every reason to believe that the figure, derived as it is from a series of extrapolations and economic assumptions never presented to the jury and yet untested by adversary presentation, is unrealistic. See <i>ante, </i>at 461. Consequently, the plurality refuses to rely on the figure, instead offering a series of its own estimates. See <i>ante, </i>at 462. These estimates also are speculative, however, as the plurality does not indicate how they were derived or where they are supported in the record. The little evidence regarding potential harm the record does yield, it turns out, is</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="486">486</a></p><p align="center">\nO\'CONNOR, J., dissenting</p><p>SO uncertain and ambiguous that the plurality cannot rely on it, either; to the extent it demonstrates anything at all, it shows respondents\' estimate to be exaggerated. See Tr. 100, 103-104.</p><p align="center">\n2</p><p>But even if we assume that the plurality\'s estimates of potential harm are plausible or supported by the evidence, they are, on this record, entirely irrelevant. The question is not simply whether <i>this Court </i>might think the award appropriate in light of its estimate of potential harm. The question is also whether <i>the jury </i>might have relied on such an estimate rather than some impermissible factor, such as a personal preference for the primarily local plaintiffs as compared to the unsympathetic and wealthy out-of-state defendant, as TXO contends. After all, due process does not simply require that a particular result be substantively acceptable; it also requires that it be reached on the basis of permissible considerations. See <i>Has lip, </i>499 U. S., at 41 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). In this case, the jury instructions precluded the jury from relying on the potential harm theory the plurality endorses. As a result, that theory can neither explain nor justify the otherwise astonishing verdict the jury returned.</p><p>At trial, the jury was instructed to consider numerous factors when setting the punitive damages award, including "\'the nature of the wrongdoing, the extent of the harm inflicted, the intent of the party committing the act, the wealth of the perpetrator, as well as any mitigating circumstances.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 463, n. 29 (plurality opinion) (quoting App. 34-35). Nowhere do the instructions mention the alternative measure of potential harm to respondents upon which the plurality relies today.</p><p>Of course, the instructions do mention that the goal of punitive damages is deterrence. One therefore might hypothesize that a particularly sophisticated jury would realize that imposing damages in an amount linked to potential harm or</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="487">487</a></p><p>the defendant\'s expected gain might provide appropriate deterrence. One might even go so far as to suppose that the jury would be daring enough to apply that measure, even though the trial court listed numerous factors, including <i>ac</i>tual harm, but made no mention of <i>potential </i>harm. But such speculation has no application in this case, for the jury instructions made it quite clear that deterrence was linked not to an unmentioned factor like potential gain but to a factor the trial court <i>did </i>mention-TXO\'s wealth:</p><blockquote><p>\n"\'The object of [punitive damages] is to deter TXO Production Corp. and others from committing like offenses in the future. <i>Therefore </i>the law recognizes that to in fact deter such conduct may require a larger fine upon one of large means than it would upon one of ordinary means under the same or similar circumstances.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 463, n. 29 (plurality opinion) (quoting App. 35) (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>A reasonable juror hearing these instructions would not have felt free to consider the potential harm or expected gain measures the plurality proposes today.</p><p>The two passages the plurality excerpts from closing arguments, see <i>ante, </i>at 461, do not support the plurality\'s theory. Respondent Tug Fork Land Company\'s closing argument does mention that TXO thought the wells would produce "\'lot[s] of money.\'" <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting Tr. 748-749). But that remark had nothing to do with punitive damages. Instead, counsel was addressing the issue of liability: According to him, TXO\'s desire to obtain all the royalties was the motive for its bad faith conduct. See Tr. 746-749 (TXO slandered respondents\' title to lower the value of the property so it could exact concessions or win 100% of royalties by means of a lawsuit). When counsel <i>did </i>discuss the appropriate measure of punitive damages, not once did he mention the potential harm to respondents. Instead, he relied exclusively on TXO\'s vast wealth:</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="488">488</a></p><blockquote><p>\n"His Honor has instructed you that you may award punitive damages and I\'ve indicated to you what punitive damages [are]. <i>Now, just consider the wealth of this corporation. </i>[T]he reason for putting in [expert evidence on TXO\'s resources] is <i>that\'s how a jury considers the amount of punitive damages. </i>This is a multi-million dollar corporation-even a billion dollars in assets .... [Think about imposing a punitive award in the range of a] million, twelve million dollars. Those kinds of numbers are not out of line when you talk about a corporation that has assets of something like a billion dollars." <i>Id., </i>at 757-758 (emphases added).</p></blockquote><p>Counsel for respondent Alliance Resources Corp. similarly did not argue that punitive damages should be linked to potential harm. He did mention that TXO anticipated a large profit from its nefarious scheme. See <i>id., </i>at 779-780; <i>ante, </i>at 461 (plurality opinion). But counsel once again made no attempt to quantify TXO\'s potential gain. Nor did he encourage the jury to base the punitive damages award on TXO\'s expected profit. Instead, counsel argued only <i>one </i>measure for punitive damages-TXO\'s wealth:</p><blockquote><p>\n"A two billion dollar company. Ha[s] earnings of $225,000,000, average. Last year made $125,000,000.00 alone. Last year. Now, what\'s a good fine for a company like that? A hundred thousand? A million? You can do that if you think it\'s fair .... " Tr. 781.</p></blockquote><p>The portion of counsel\'s argument the plurality relies upon, <i>ante, </i>at 461, turns out to be a transition between a discussion of TXO\'s conduct and a plea for the jury to award punitive damages based exclusively on TXO\'s wealth. Immediately after delivering the portion of the argument the plurality reproduces-in which counsel told the jury that the punishment should" \'fit\'" the scheme and" \'fit the wealth,\'" <i>ibid.</i>he asked rhetorically, "Now, how much is the wealth?" Tr. 780. It was then that he told the jury, in great detail, about</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="489">489</a></p><p>TXO\'s vast resources. At no point, however, did counsel ask rhetorically, "Now, how much was the potential profit?" At no point did he answer that question. Nor did he ever suggest that the jury calculate potential harm or base its punitive damages award thereon. Instead, like co counsel before him, he relied exclusively on TXO\'s wealth. See <i>id., </i>at 781-782.</p><p>I am therefore unpersuaded by the plurality\'s assertion that this award may be upheld based on the potential harm to respondents or TXO\'s potential gain. That theory was not available to the jury under the court\'s instructions. It was not one supported by evidence on which the jury might have relied. And it is not one that trial counsel chose to promote. It was instead an after-the-fact rationalization invented by appellate counsel who could not otherwise explain this disproportionate award.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>There is another explanation for the verdict, but it is not one that permits affirmance. As I read the record in this case, it seems quite likely that the jury in fact was unduly influenced by the fact that TXO is a very large, out-of-state corporation.</p><p>In <i>Haslip, </i>this Court considered jury instructions that differed from those used here in two material respects. First, unlike the instructions in <i>Has lip, </i>which did not permit the jury to consider the defendant\'s wealth, the instructions in this case specifically directed the jury to take TXO\'s wealth into account. The plurality concedes that introducing TXO\'s wealth into the calculus "increased the risk that the award may have been influenced by prejudice against large corporations, a risk that is of special concern when the defendant is," as here, "a nonresident." <i>Ante, </i>at 464. Second, the instructions directed the jury to impose punitive damages" \'to provide additional compensation for the conduct to which the injured parties have been subjected.\'" <i>Ante, </i>at 463, n. 29</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="490">490</a></p><p align="center">\nO\'CONNOR, J., dissenting</p><p>(plurality opinion) (quoting App. 34). The latter instruction, of course, is without legal meaning. <i>Ante, </i>at 464 (plurality opinion) (We do "not understand the reference ... to \'additional compensation\' "). Plaintiffs are compensated for injuries they have suffered; one cannot speak of "additional compensation" unless it is linked to some additional harm.</p><p>To a juror, however, compensation is the money it awards the plaintiff; "additional compensation," if not linked to a particular measure of harm, is simply additional money the jury gives to the plaintiff. As a result, the "additional compensation" instruction, considered together with the instruction directing the jury\'s attention to TXO\'s massive wealth, encouraged the jury to transfer some of TXO\'s impressive wealth to the smaller and more sympathetic respondents as undifferentiated "additional compensation"-for any reason, or no reason at all. In fact, the instructions practically ensured that this would occur. They provided the jury with only two objective factors on which to rely. See <i>supra, </i>at 486 (citing jury instructions). The first was actual harm, a relatively small sum on which the jury obviously did not rely; the second was TXO\'s wealth, a factor that obviously impressed the jury a great deal. Thus, unlike the instructions in <i>Haslip, </i>these instructions did not prevent respondents from "enjoy[ing] a windfall because they have the good fortune to have a defendant with a deep pocket." 499 U. S., at 22. Instead, they ensured that a windfall verdict would result by inviting the jury to redistribute wealth to respondents as undifferentiated "additional compensation," based solely on TXO\'s financial position.</p><p>That a jury might have such inclinations should come as no surprise. Courts long have recognized that jurors may view large corporations with great disfavor. See, <i>e. g., Illinois Central R. Co. </i>v. <i>Welch, </i>52 Ill. 183, 188 (1869) ("[J]uries may generally assess an amount of damages against railway corporations which, in similar cases between individuals, would be considered unjust in the extreme. It</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="491">491</a></p><p>is lamentable that the popular prejudice against these corporations should be so powerful as to taint the administration of justice, but we cannot close our eyes to the fact"). Corporations are mere abstractions and, as such, are unlikely to be viewed with much sympathy. Moreover, they often represent a large accumulation of productive resources; jurors naturally think little of taking an otherwise large sum of money out of what appears to be an enormously larger pool of wealth. Finally, juries may feel privileged to correct perceived social ills stemming from unequal wealth distribution by transferring money from "wealthy" corporations to comparatively needier plaintiffs. Brickman, The Asbestos Litigation Crisis, 13 Cardozo L. Rev. 1819, 1849, n. 128 (1992); Ellis, Fairness and Efficiency in the Law of Punitive Damages, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev. 1, 61-62 (1982); Owen, Problems in Assessing Punitive Damages Against Manufacturers of Defective Products, 49 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1, 45-46 (1982) (jury assessing punitive damages against multimillion dollar corporation forced to think of an award measuring seven, eight, or nine figures); see also <i>supra, </i>at 474-475 (juror discretion in awarding punitive damages not limited); cf. <i>Smith </i>v. <i>Co</i><i>vell, </i>100 Cal. App. 3d 947, 960, 161 Cal. Rptr. 377, 385 (1980) (juror impressed with idea that plaintiffs had money and "\'didn\'t need anymore\' ").</p><p>This is not to say that consideration of a defendant\'s wealth is unconstitutional. To be sure, there are strong economic arguments that permitting juries to consider wealth is unwise if not irrational, see Abraham &amp; Jeffries, Punitive Damages and the Rule of Law: The Role of Defendant\'s Wealth, 18 J. Legal Studies 415 (1989), especially where the defendant is a corporation, <i>id., </i>at 421-422; cf. <i>Zazu Designs </i>v. <i>L\'Oreal, </i>S. <i>A., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/979/499/">979 F.2d 499</a>, 508-509 (CA 7 1992) (Easterbrook, J.). But, "[j]ust as the Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Herbert Spencer\'s Social Statics, see <i>Lochner </i>v. <i>New York, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/198/45/case.html">198 U. S. 45</a>, 75 (1905) (Holmes, J., dissenting)," it does not require us to adopt the views of the Law and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="492">492</a></p><p>Economics school either. As a historical matter, the wealth of the perpetrator long has been thought relevant. See <i>Browning-Ferris, </i>492 U. S., at 300 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (citing the Magna Carta and Blackstone\'s Commentaries). Moreover, <i>Haslip </i>itself suggests that the defendant\'s wealth is a permissible consideration, <i>ante, </i>at 462, n. 28, 464 (plurality opinion), although it does so only in the context of <i>appellate </i>review. See 499 U. S., at 22.</p><p>Nonetheless, courts must have authority to recognize the special danger of bias that such considerations create. The plurality does just that today, <i>ante, </i>at 464, as this Court, other tribunals, and numerous commentators have before. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Morris, Punitive Damages in Tort Cases, 44 Harv. L. Rev. 1173, 1191 (1931) ("It is a good guess that rich men do not fare well before juries, and the more emphasis placed on their riches, the less well they fare. Such evidence may do more harm than good; jurymen may be more interested in divesting vested interests than in attempting to fix penalties which will make for effective working of the admonitory function"); Abraham &amp; Jeffries, <i>supra, </i>at 424; <i>Illinois Central R. Co., supra, </i>at 188 (bias against railroads); <i>McConnell </i>v. <i>Hampton, </i>12 Johns. 234, 236 (N. Y. 1815) (Thompson, C. J.) (jury unduly influenced by defendant\'s great wealth); cf. <i>Newport </i>v. <i>Fact Concerts, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/247/case.html">453 U. S. 247</a>, 270-271 (1981) ("[E]vidence of a [municipality\'s wealth, inasmuch as it has unlimited taxing power], may have a prejudicial impact on the jury, in effect encouraging it to impose a sizable award. The impact of such a windfall recovery is likely to be both unpredictable and, at times, substantial"); see also <i>Has lip, </i>499 U. S., at 43 (O\'CONNOR, J., dissenting) (jurors, if not properly guided, may "target unpopular defendants ... and redistribute wealth").</p><p>The risk of prejudice was especially grave here. The jury repeatedly was told of TXO\'s extraordinary resources, which respondents estimated at $2 billion. To make matters</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="493">493</a></p><p>worse, unlike the jurors or the primary plaintiffs, TXO was not from West Virginia. It was an interloper, from the large State of Texas. As the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia has recognized, the temptation to transfer wealth from out-of-state corporate defendants to in-state plaintiffs can be quite strong. See <i>Garnes </i>v. <i>Fleming Landfill, Inc., </i>186 W. Va. 656, 665, 413 S. E. 2d 897, 906 (1991) (Excess jury discretion "[i]nevitably ... leads to increasing efforts to redistribute wealth from without the state to within"; cases involving large awards typically pit local plaintiffs against "out-of-state (often faceless, publicly held) corporations"). That court speaks from experience. The three highest punitive damages awards ever affirmed in West Virginia, including this one, were assessed against relatively wealthy out-of-state defendants. <i>Jarvis </i>v. <i>Modern Woodmen of America, </i>185 W. Va. 305, 406 S. E. 2d 736 (1991); <i>Berry </i>v. <i>Nationwide Mutual Fire Ins. Co., </i>181 W. Va. 168, 381</p><p>Counsels\' arguments, however, converted that grave risk of prejudice into a near certainty. Repeatedly they reminded the jury that TXO was from another State. Repeatedly they told the jury about TXO\'s massive wealth. And repeatedly they told the jury that it could do anything it thought "fair." The opening line from rebuttal set the tone. "Ladies and gentleman of the jury," one attorney began, "this greedy bunch from down in Texas still doesn\'t understand this case." Tr. 773. Playing on images of Texans as overrich gamblers who profit by chance rather than work, he referred to TXO shortly thereafter as a bunch of "Texas high rollers, wildcatters." <i>Id., </i>at 777. Finally, counsel drove the point home yet one more time, comparing TXO to an obviously wealthy out-of-town visitor who refuses to put money in the parking meter to help pay for community service:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Well, what is fair? ... If someone <i>comes to town </i>and intentionally doesn\'t put a quarter in the meter, stays</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="494">494</a></p><blockquote><p>\nhere all day, [in this] <i>town that needs it to pay for the police force and the fire department, </i>they give [him] a fine. And at the end of the day [he] may have to pay a dollar. That person reaches in his billfold at the end of the day and maybe <i>he\'s got a hundred bucks in there. </i>He doesn\'t want to have to pay that dollar, but he does, because he knows if he doesn\'t [he\'ll have legal problems] .... The town didn\'t take everything from the individual, didn\'t ruin [him], just took one percent of what that person had in cash. One percent. <i>You can fine TXO one percent if you want, you can fine them one dollar if you want. </i>But I submit to you a one percent fine, the same as John Doe on this street, would be fair. <i>That\'s twelve and a half million dollars, based on what they had left over. And their earnings w[ere] $225,000,000.00 [per year]. </i>I mean, yeah, their cash flow. Their surplus. So anything between twelve and a half million and twenty-two million is only one percent-the same as this poor guy who just tried to cheat a little bit. Now that\'s a lot of money. I hope, like I said, you <i>don\'t analyze this on a lot or a little, but fair." Id., </i>at 781-782 (emphases added).</p></blockquote><p>Over and over respondents\' lawyers reminded the jury that there were virtually no substantive limits on its discretion. Time and again they told the jury of TXO\'s great wealth and that it could take away any amount it wanted, as long as it seemed "fair." <i>Id., </i>at 781 ("It isn\'t really whether the verdict is too large or too small, too big or too little. It\'s whether it\'s fair"); <i>ibid. </i>("A two billion dollar company. Have earnings of $225,000,000.00, average. Last year made $125,000,000.00 alone. Last year. Now, what\'s a good fine for a company like that? A hundred thousand? A million? You can do that if you think it\'s fair ... "). And each time the argument found solid support in the trial court\'s instructions, which not only licensed the jury to afford respondents</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="495">495</a></p><p>any "additional compensation" they believed appropriate, but also encouraged them to do so based on TXO\'s wealth alone.</p><p>Given the absence of another plausible explanation for this monumentally large punitive damages award, I believe it likely, if not inescapable, that the jury was influenced unduly by TXO\'s out-of-state status and its large resources. The plurality acknowledges this possibility, see <i>ante, </i>at 464, but refuses to address it. TXO, the plurality contends, failed to press its objections to the jury instructions in the state court below. <i>Ibid. </i>I disagree. TXO\'s brief specifically argued that the jury instructions did not meet the <i>"Has lip </i>standards and [were] not constitutionally permissible." Brief for Appellant in No. 20281 (W. Va.), p. 48; see <i>id., </i>at 44-46 (jury instructions insufficient under <i>Garnes </i>v. <i>Fleming Landfill, Inc., supra, </i>a recent West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals decision interpreting <i>Haslip). </i>The State Supreme Court of Appeals so understood TXO\'s challenge. See 187 W. Va., at 473-477,419 S. E. 2d, at 886-890.</p><p>Of course, TXO did not make precisely the same arguments it makes here. But it was not required to. "Once a federal claim is properly presented, a party can make any argument in support of that claim; parties are not limited to the precise arguments they made below." <i>Yee </i>v. <i>Escondido, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/519/case.html">503 U. S. 519</a>, 534 (1992). There can be little doubt that TXO argued below that the punitive damages award was excessive; there can be little doubt that TXO identified the jury instructions as being partially responsible. TXO ought not be precluded from fully presenting its arguments here. Because those arguments demonstrate that this award was based on considerations inconsistent with due process, I would reverse the judgment below so the matter could be submitted to the consideration of a second jury.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Confronted by a $10 million verdict on damages of $19,000, the State Supreme Court of Appeals in this case did not en-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="496">496</a></p><p>gage in searching review. Instead it added insult to injury, applying cavalier standards in the course of a cursory examination of the case. Because the review afforded TXO was insufficient to conform with the criteria this Court approved in <i>Haslip, </i>the case at least should be remanded for constitutionally adequate postverdict review.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>Two Terms ago, this Court in <i>Haslip </i>upheld Alabama\'s punitive damages regime against constitutional challenge. Although the Court recognized that juries in Alabama receive limited instructions regarding punitive damages, see 499 U. S., at 6, n. 1, 19-20, it was reassured by the fact that the Alabama courts subject punitive verdicts to exacting postverdict review at two different levels. First, Alabama trial courts must indicate on the record their "\'reasons for interfering with a jury verdict, or refusing to do so, on grounds of excessiveness.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 20 (quoting <i>Hammond </i>v. <i>Gadsden, </i>493 So. 2d 1374, 1379 (1986)). Second, the Alabama Supreme Court itself provides an additional "check" by conducting comparative analysis and applying detailed substantive standards-seven in all-thereby "ensur[ing] that the award does not exceed an amount that will accomplish society\'s goals of punishment and deterrence." 499 U. S., at 21 (internal quotation marks omitted). Specifically, the Alabama Supreme Court examines:</p><blockquote><p>\n"(a) whether there is a reasonable relationship between the punitive damages award and the harm likely to result from the defendant\'s conduct as well as the harm that actually has occurred; (b) the degree of reprehensibility of the defendant\'s conduct, the duration of that conduct, the defendant\'s awareness, any concealment, and the existence and frequency of similar past conduct; (c) the profitability to the defendant of the wrongful conduct and the desirability of removing that profit and of having the defendant also sustain a loss; (d) the \'financial</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="497">497</a></p><blockquote><p>\nposition\' of the defendant; (e) all the costs of litigation; (f) the imposition of criminal sanctions on the defendant for its conduct, these to be taken in mitigation; and (g) the existence of other civil awards against the defendant for the same conduct, these also to be taken in mitigation." <i>Id., </i>at 21-22.</p></blockquote><p>In <i>Has lip, </i>the Court concluded that application of those standards "imposes a sufficiently definite and meaningful constraint" on factfinder discretion. <i>Id., </i>at 22. Because the standards had a "real effect," <i>ibid., </i>the Court upheld Alabama\'s regime against constitutional challenge despite the relatively sparse guidance it afforded juries.</p><p>As the plurality admits, <i>ante, </i>at 463-464, the jury instructions used here were not dissimilar to those employed in <i>Has lip. </i>Unlike <i>Haslip, </i>however, the verdict they produced was not subjected to post-trial review sufficient to impose a "meaningful constraint" on factfinder discretion. Indeed, the post-trial review offered here bears no resemblance to that approved in <i>Has lip. </i>In contrast to the trial judge in <i>Haslip, </i>the trial judge here made no written findings. Nor did he announce why he believed-or even if he believedthat the amount of damages bore a reasonable or recognizable relationship to actual damages or any other relevant measure. Instead, ruling from the bench, the trial judge summarily denied TXO\'s motions seeking reduction or elimination of the punitive damages award.</p><p>More important, the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia did not do much better. At the outset, it refused to consider the possibility of remittitur because TXO "and its agents and servants failed to conduct themselves as gentlemen." 187 W. Va., at 462, 419 S. E. 2d, at 875. Proceeding to the question whether the award of punitive damages should be stricken as excessive, the court distinguished between two categories of defendants: those who are "really stupid" and those who are "really mean." <i>Id., </i>at 474-476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 887-889. If the defendant is "really stupid,"</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="498">498</a></p><p align="center">\nO\'CONNOR, J., dissenting</p><p>the court explained, "the outer limit of punitive damages is" generally about "five to one." <i>Id., </i>at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889. For the "really mean" defendant, however, "even punitive damages 500 times greater than compensatory damages are not <i>per se </i>unconstitutional." <i>Ibid. </i>TXO, it seems, was not really stupid but "really mean." The Supreme Court of Appeals affirmed the $10 million punitive award even though it was 526 times greater than compensatory damages.</p><p>Reference to categories like "really stupid" and "really mean" are a caricature of the difficult task of determining whether an award may be upheld consistent with due process. It is simply not enough to observe that the conduct was malicious and conclude that, as a result, the sky (or 500 times compensatory damages) is the limit. But cf. <i>ante, </i>at 468-469 (KENNEDY, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (so concluding solely because the conduct was malicious and the defendant rich). Instead, post-trial review must be sufficient to "ensur[e] that punitive damages awards are not grossly out of proportion to the severity of the offense and have some understandable relationship to" some measure of harm. <i>Has lip, supra, </i>at 22. Aside from its two-page dissertation on the difference between "really stupid" and "really mean," however, the State Supreme Court of Appeals offered only three conclusory sentences in a single paragraph to bolster its conclusion that the damages here were not excessive. See <i>ante, </i>at 453 (plurality opinion) (citing 187 W. Va., at 476, 419 S. E. 2d, at 889). Because I believe that such cursory review is inconsistent with this Court\'s decision in <i>Haslip, </i>I cannot join my colleagues in affirming.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>That the Supreme Court of Appeals would engage in such cursory review is something of a surprise. In <i>Garnes </i>v. <i>Fleming Landfill, Inc., </i>186 W. Va. 656, 413 S. E. 2d 897 (1991), that court demonstrated concern for the due process implications of punitive awards. Holding that West Virgin-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="499">499</a></p><p>ia\'s previous punitive damages regime was constitutionally suspect in light of <i>Haslip, </i>it required trial courts to instruct juries on numerous factors relevant to the measure of punitive damages, see 186 W. Va., at 667-668, 413 S. E. 2d, at 908-909; it mandated that trial courts conduct extensive review and articulate reasons for their decisions on the record, <i>id., </i>at 668-669, 413 S. E. 2d, at 909-910; and it announced that it would apply the factors approved in <i>Haslip </i>in its own review, 186 W. Va., at 669, 413 S. E. 2d, at 910.</p><p>Unfortunately for TXO, <i>Garnes </i>was decided after TXO\'s trial took place. Although the Supreme Court of Appeals recognized that TXO had not received the benefit of <i>Garnes\' </i>and <i>Haslip\'s </i>protections, it refused to remand the case. Instead, the court indicated that it would be "especially diligent" in reviewing this award; it went on to recite language from both <i>Haslip </i>and <i>Garnes. </i>It is therefore clear that <i>Haslip </i>still governs punitive damages awards in West Virginia. As a result, the plurality perhaps declines to reverse because it believes that the Supreme Court of Appeals\' failure to follow <i>Haslip </i>here is of little consequence to anyone but TXO. After all, a decision of this Court requiring more searching review would alter only the result in this particular case and perhaps a few like it, without changing the law, even in West Virginia.</p><p>If the plurality is in fact proceeding on such an assumption, I believe it is mistaken. While this Court has the ultimate power to interpret the Constitution, we grant review in only a small number of cases. We therefore rely primarily on state courts to fulfill the constitutional role as primary guarantors of federal rights. But the state courts must do more than recite the constitutional rule. They also must apply it, faithful to its letter and cognizant of the principles underlying it. Unfortunately, such review is not always forthcoming. <i>Amici </i>recite case after case in which review has been inadequate or absent altogether. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Brief for Phillips Petroleum Co. et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>20-27. The Supreme</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="500">500</a></p><p>Court of Appeals of West Virginia, at the same time it recognized <i>Haslip </i>as law, itself warned:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[WJe understand as well as the next court how to ... articulate the correct legal principle, and then perversely fit into that principle a set of facts to which the principle obviously does not apply. [All judges] know how to mouth the correct legal rules with ironic solemnity while avoiding those rules\' logical consequences." <i>Garnes, supra, </i>at 666, 413 S. E. 2d, at 907 (footnote omitted).</p></blockquote><p>I fear that the Supreme Court of Appeals followed such a course in this case. By affirming the judgment nonetheless, today\'s decision renders the meaningful appellate review contemplated in <i>Haslip </i>illusory; courts now may disregard the post-trial review required by due process at whim or will, so long as they do not deny its necessity openly or altogether.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>As little as 30 years ago, punitive damages awards were "rarely assessed" and usually "small in amount." Ellis, 56 S. Cal. L. Rev., at 2. Recently, however, the frequency and size of such awards have been skyrocketing. One commentator has observed that "hardly a month goes by without a multimillion-dollar punitive damages verdict in a product liability case." Wheeler, A Proposal for Further Common Law Development of the Use of Punitive Damages in Modern Product Liability Litigation, 40 Ala. L. Rev. 919 (1989). And it appears that the upward trajectory continues unabated. See Volz &amp; Fayz, Punitive Damages and the Due Process Clause: The Search for Constitutional Standards, 69 U. Det. Mercy L. Rev. 459, 462, n. 17 (1992). The increased frequency and size of punitive awards, however, has not been matched by a corresponding expansion of procedural protections or predictability. On the contrary, although some courts have made genuine efforts at reform, many courts</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="501">501</a></p><p>continue to provide jurors with skeletal guidance that permits the traditional guarantor of fairness-the jury itself-to be converted into a source of caprice and bias. This Court\'s decision in <i>Haslip </i>promised that, even if juries occasionally failed to fulfill their function faithfully, trial and appellate courts would provide meaningful review sufficient to discern impermissible influences and guarantee constitutional results. In my view, today\'s decision fails to make good on that promise. I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
