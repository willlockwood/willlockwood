JUSTICE STEWART announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join.</p>\n<p>In <em>United States v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html">388 U. S. 218</a></span>, and <em>Gilbert v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html">388 U. S. 263</a></span>, this Court held</p>\n<p>"that a post-indictment pretrial lineup at which the accused is exhibited to identifying witnesses is a critical stage of the criminal prosecution; that police conduct of such a lineup without notice to and in the absence of his counsel denies the accused his Sixth [and Fourteenth] Amendment right to counsel and calls in question the admissibility at trial of the in-court identifications of the accused by witnesses who attended the lineup."</p>\n<p><em>Gilbert v. California, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html#272">388 U. S. 272</a></span>.  Those cases further held that no "in-court identifications" are admissible in evidence if their "source" is a lineup conducted in violation of this constitutional standard.  "Only a <em>per se</em> exclusionary rule as to such testimony can be an effective sanction," the Court said, "to assure that law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="684">Page 406 U. S. 684</a></p><p> enforcement authorities will respect the accused\'s constitutional right to the presence of his counsel at the critical lineup."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/263/case.html#273">388 U. S. 273</a></span>.  In the present case, we are asked to extend the <em>Wade-Gilbert per se</em> exclusionary rule to identification testimony based upon a police station showup that took place before the defendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged with any criminal offense.</p>\n<p>On February 21, 1968, a man named Willie Shard reported to the Chicago police that the previous day two men had robbed him on a Chicago street of a wallet containing, among other things, traveler\'s checks and a Social Security card.  On February 22, two police officers stopped the petitioner and a companion, Ralph Bean, on West Madison Street in Chicago. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  When asked for identification, the petitioner produced a wallet that contained three traveler\'s checks and a Social Security card, all bearing the name of Willie Shard. Papers with Shard\'s name on them were also found in Bean\'s possession.  When asked to explain his possession of Shard\'s property, the petitioner first said that the traveler\'s checks were "play money," and then told the officers that he had won them in a crap game.  The officers then arrested the petitioner and Bean and took them to a police station.</p>\n<p>Only after arriving at the police station, and checking the records there did the arresting officers learn of the Shard robbery.  A police car was then dispatched to Shard\'s place of employment, where it picked up Shard and brought him to the police station.  Immediately upon entering the room in the police station where the petitioner and Bean were seated at a table, Shard positively identified them as the men who had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="685">Page 406 U. S. 685</a></p><p> robbed him two days earlier.  No lawyer was present in the room, and neither the petitioner nor Bean had asked for legal assistance, or been advised of any right to the presence of counsel.</p>\n<p>More than six weeks later, the petitioner and Bean were indicted for the robbery of Willie Shard.  Upon arraignment, counsel was appointed to represent them, and they pleaded not guilty.  A pretrial motion to suppress Shard\'s identification testimony was denied, and, at the trial, Shard testified as a witness for the prosecution.  In his testimony, he described his identification of the two men at the police station on February 22, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and identified them again in the courtroom as the men </p><p><a class="page-number" name="686">Page 406 U. S. 686</a></p><p> who had robbed him on February 20. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  He was cross-examined at length regarding the circumstances of his identification of the two defendants.  <em>Cf. Pointer v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/case.html">380 U. S. 400</a></span>.  The jury found both defendants guilty, and the petitioner\'s conviction was affirmed on appeal.  <em>People v. Kirby,</em> 121 Ill.App.2d 323, 257 N.E.2d 589. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The Illinois appellate court held that the admission of Shard\'s testimony was not error, relying upon an earlier decision of the Illinois Supreme Court, <em>People v. Palmer,</em> 41 Ill.2d 571, 244 N.E.2d 173, holding that the <em>Wade-Gilbert per se</em> exclusionary rule is not applicable to pre-indictment confrontations.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="687">Page 406 U. S. 687</a></p><p> We granted certiorari, limited to this question.  402 U.S. 995. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>We note at the outset that the constitutional privilege against compulsory self-incrimination is in no way implicated here.  The Court emphatically rejected the claimed applicability of that constitutional guarantee in <em>Wade</em> itself:</p>\n<p>"Neither the lineup itself nor anything shown by this record that Wade was required to do in the lineup violated his privilege against self-incrimination.  We have only recently reaffirmed that the privilege"</p>\n<p>"protects an accused only from being compelled to testify against himself, or otherwise provide the State with evidence of a testimonial or communicative nature. . . ."</p>\n<p>"<em>Schmerber v.

It is compulsion of the accused </p><p><a class="page-number" name="688">Page 406 U.

S. 222</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It follows that the doctrine of <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span>, has no applicability whatever to the issue before us; for the <em>Miranda</em> decision was based exclusively upon the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, upon the theory that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.</p>\n<p>The <em>Wade-Gilbert</em> exclusionary rule, by contrast, stems from a quite different constitutional guarantee -- the guarantee of the right to counsel contained in the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments. Unless all semblance of principled constitutional adjudication is to be abandoned, therefore, it is to the decisions construing that guarantee that we must look in determining the present controversy.</p>\n<p>In a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court\'s landmark opinion in <em>Powell v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html">287 U. S. 45</a></span>, it has been firmly established that a person\'s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.  <em>See Powell v. Alabama, supra; Johnson v. Zerbst,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/304/458/case.html">304 U. S. 458</a></span>; <em>Hamilton v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/52/case.html">368 U. S. 52</a></span>; <em>Gideon v. Wainwright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/case.html">372 U. S. 335</a></span>; <em>White v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/373/59/case.html">373 U. S. 59</a></span>; <em>Massiah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html">377 U. S. 201</a></span>; <em>United States v. Wade,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html">388 U. S. 218</a></span>; <em>Gilbert v.

Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/399/1/case.html">399 U. S. 1</a></span>.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that a defendant in a criminal case has a constitutional right to counsel only at the trial itself.  The <em>Powell</em> case makes clear that the right attaches at the time of arraignment, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="689">Page 406 U. S. 689</a></p><p> has recently held that it exists also at the time of a preliminary hearing.  <em>Coleman v. Alabama, supra.</em>  But the point is that, while members of the Court have differed as to existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, all of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings -- whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.</p>\n<p>The only seeming deviation from this long line of constitutional decisions was <em>Escobedo v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/case.html">378 U. S. 478</a></span>.  But <em>Escobedo</em> is not apposite here, for two distinct reasons.  First, the Court. in retrospect. perceived that the "prime purpose" of <em>Escobedo</em> was not to vindicate the constitutional right to counsel as such, but, like <em>Miranda,</em> "to guarantee full effectuation of the privilege against self-incrimination. . . ."  <em>Johnson v. New Jersey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html">384 U. S. 719</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html#729">384 U. S. 729</a></span>.  Secondly, and perhaps even more important for purely practical purposes, the Court has limited the holding of <em>Escobedo</em> to its own facts, <em>Johnson v. New Jersey, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/case.html#733">384 U. S. 733</a></span>-734, and those facts are not remotely akin to the facts of the case before us.</p>\n<p>The initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism.  It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice.  For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified.  It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 406 U. S. 690</a></p><p> It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the "criminal prosecutions" to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>See Powell v. Alabama,</em> 287 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/case.html#66">287 U. S. 66</a></span>-71; <em>Massiah v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/case.html">377 U. S. 201</a></span>; <em>Spano v. New York,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/315/case.html">360 U. S. 315</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/360/315/case.html#324">360 U. S. 324</a></span> (DOUGLAS, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>In this case, we are asked to import into a routine police investigation an absolute constitutional guarantee historically and rationally applicable only after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings.  We decline to do so.  Less than a year after <em>Wade</em> and <em>Gilbert</em> were decided, the Court explained the rule of those decisions as follows:</p>\n<p>"The rationale of those cases was that an accused is entitled to counsel at any \'critical stage of the <em>prosecution,</em>\' and that a post-indictment lineup is such a \'critical stage.\'"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)  <em>Simmons v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/377/case.html">390 U. S. 377</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/377/case.html#382">390 U. S. 382</a></span>-383.  We decline to depart from that rationale today by imposing a <em>per se</em> exclusionary rule upon testimony concerning an identification that took place long before the commencement of any prosecution whatever.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>What has been said is not to suggest that there may not be occasions during the course of a criminal investigation when the police do abuse identification procedures.  Such abuses are not beyond the reach of the Constitution.  As the Court pointed out in <em>Wade</em> itself, it is always necessary to "scrutinize any pretrial confrontation. . . ."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 406 U. S. 691</a></p><p> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#227">388 U. S. 227</a></span>.  The Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments forbids a lineup that is unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification.  <em>Stovall v.

Alabama</em> and succeeding cases requires that we scrutinize <em>any</em> pretrial confrontation of the accused to determine whether the presence of his counsel is necessary to preserve the defendant\'s basic right to a fair trial as affected by his right meaningfully to cross-examine the witnesses against him and to have effective assistance of counsel at the trial itself.  It calls upon us to analyze whether potential substantial prejudice to defendant\'s rights inheres in the particular confrontation and the ability of counsel to help avoid that prejudice."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#227">388 U. S. 227</a></span> (emphasis in original). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="695">Page 406 U. S. 695</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It was that constitutional principle that the Court applied in <em>Wade</em> to pretrial confrontations for identification purposes.  The Court first met the government\'s contention that a confrontation for identification is "a mere preparatory step in the gathering of the prosecution\'s evidence," much like the scientific examination of fingerprints and blood samples.  The Court responded that, in the latter instances,</p>\n<p>"the accused has the opportunity for a meaningful confrontation of the Government\'s case at trial through the ordinary processes of cross-examination of the Government\'s expert witnesses and the presentation of the evidence of his own experts."</p>\n<p>The accused thus has no right to have counsel present at such examinations:</p>\n<p>"they are not critical stages, since there is minimal risk that his counsel\'s absence at such stages might derogate from his right to a fair trial."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#227">388 U. S. 227</a></span>-228.</p>\n<p>In contrast, the Court said,</p>\n<p>"the confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#228">388 U. S. 228</a></span>.  Most importantly,</p>\n<p>"the accused\'s inability effectively to reconstruct at trial any unfairness that occurred at the lineup may deprive him of his only opportunity meaningfully to attack the credibility of the witness\' courtroom identification."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#231">388 U. S. 231</a></span>-232. The Court\'s analysis of pretrial confrontations for identification purposes produced the following conclusion:</p>\n<p>"Insofar as the accused\'s conviction may rest on a courtroom identification in fact, the fruit of a suspect pretrial identification which the accused is helpless to subject to effective scrutiny at trial, the accused is deprived of that right of cross-examination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="696">Page 406 U. S. 696</a></p><p> which is an essential safeguard to his right to confront the witnesses against him.  <em>Pointer v. Texas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/380/400/case.html">380 U. S. 400</a></span>.  And even though cross-examination is a precious safeguard to a fair trial, it cannot be viewed as an absolute assurance of accuracy and reliability.  Thus, in the present context, where so many variables and pitfalls exist, the first line of defense must be the prevention of unfairness and the lessening of the hazards of eyewitness identification at the lineup itself.  The trial which might determine the accused\'s fate may well not be that in the courtroom but that at the pretrial confrontation, with the State aligned against the accused, the witness the sole jury, and the accused unprotected against the overreaching, intentional or unintentional, and with little or no effective appeal from the judgment there rendered by the witness -- \'that\'s the man.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#235">388 U. S. 235</a></span>-236.  The Court then applied that conclusion to the specific facts of the case.</p>\n<p>"Since it appears that there is grave potential for prejudice, intentional or not, in the pretrial lineup, which may not be capable of reconstruction at trial, and since presence of counsel itself can often avert prejudice and assure a meaningful confrontation at trial, there can be little doubt that for <em>Wade</em> the post-indictment lineup was a critical stage of the prosecution at which he was \'as much entitled to such aid [of counsel] . . . as at the trial itself.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#236">388 U. S. 236</a></span>-237.</p>\n<p>While it should go without saying, it appears necessary, in view of the plurality opinion today, to reemphasize that <em>Wade</em> did not require the presence of counsel at pretrial confrontations for identification purposes simply on the basis of an abstract consideration of the words "criminal prosecutions" in the Sixth Amendment.  Counsel is required at those confrontations because</p>\n<p>"the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="697">Page 406 U. S. 697</a></p><p> dangers inherent in eyewitness identification and the suggestibility inherent in the context of the pretrial identification,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#235">388 U. S. 235</a></span>, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] mean that protection must be afforded to the</p>\n<p>"most basic right [of] a criminal defendant -- his right to a fair trial at which the witnesses against him might be meaningfully cross-examined,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#224">388 U. S. 224</a></span>.  Indeed, the Court expressly stated that</p>\n<p>"[l]egislative or other regulations, such as those of local police departments, which eliminate the risks of abuse and unintentional suggestion at lineup proceedings and the impediments to meaningful confrontation at trial may also remove the basis for regarding the stage as \'critical.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#239">388 U. S. 239</a></span>; <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#239">388 U. S. 239</a></span> n. 30; <em>Gilbert v.

Hence, "the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#689">406 U. S. 689</a></span>, is completely irrelevant to whether counsel is necessary at a pretrial confrontation for identification in order to safeguard the accused\'s constitutional rights to confrontation and the effective assistance of counsel at his trial.</p>\n<p>In view of <em>Wade,</em> it is plain, and the plurality today does not attempt to dispute it, that there inhere in a confrontation </p><p><a class="page-number" name="698">Page 406 U. S. 698</a></p><p> for identification conducted after arrest [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] the identical hazards to a fair trial that inhere in such a confrontation conducted "after the onset of formal prosecutorial proceedings."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#690">406 U. S. 690</a></span>.  The plurality apparently considers an arrest, which for present purposes we must assume to be based upon probable cause, to be nothing more than part of "a routine police investigation," <em>ibid.,</em> and thus not "the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#689">406 U. S. 689</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  An arrest, according to the plurality, does not face the accused "with the prosecutorial forces of organized society," nor immerse him "in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law."  Those consequences ensue, says the plurality, only with "[t]he initiation of judicial criminal proceedings,"</p>\n<p>"[f]or it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  If these propositions do not amount to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="699">Page 406 U. S. 699</a></p><p> "mere formalism," <em>ibid.,</em> it is difficult to know how to characterize them. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  An arrest evidences the belief of the police that the perpetrator of a crime has been caught.  A post-arrest confrontation for identification is not "a mere preparatory step in the gathering of the prosecution\'s evidence."  <em>Wade, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#227">388 U. S. 227</a></span>.  A primary, and frequently sole, purpose of the confrontation for identification at that stage is to accumulate proof to buttress the conclusion of the police that they have the offender in hand.  The plurality offers no reason, and I can think of none, for concluding that a post-arrest confrontation for identification, unlike a post-charge confrontation, is not among those</p>\n<p>"critical confrontations of the accused by the prosecution at pretrial proceedings where the results might well settle the accused\'s fate and reduce the trial itself to a mere formality."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#224">388 U. S. 224</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The highly suggestive form of confrontation employed in this case underscores the point.  This showup was particularly fraught with the peril of mistaken </p><p><a class="page-number" name="700">Page 406 U. S. 700</a></p><p> identification.  In the setting of a police station squad room, where all present except petitioner and Bean were police officers, the danger was quite real that Shard\'s understandable resentment might lead him too readily to agree with the police that the pair under arrest, and the only persons exhibited to him, were indeed the robbers.</p>\n<p>"It is hard to imagine a situation more clearly conveying the suggestion to the witness that the one presented is believed guilty by the police."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#234">388 U. S. 234</a></span>.  The State had no case without Shard\'s identification testimony, [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] and safeguards against that consequence were therefore of critical importance.  Shard\'s testimony itself demonstrates the necessity for such safeguards.  On direct examination, Shard identified petitioner and Bean not as the alleged robbers on trial in the courtroom, but as the pair he saw at the police station.  His testimony thus lends strong support to the observation, quoted by the Court in <em>Wade,</em> 388 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/case.html#229">388 U. S. 229</a></span>, that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is a matter of common experience that, once a witness has picked out the accused at the line-up, he is not likely to go back on his word later on, so that, in practice, the issue of identity may (in the absence of other relevant evidence) for all practical purposes be determined there and then, before the trial."</p>\n<p>Williams &amp; Hammelmann, Identification Parades, Part I, [1963] Crim.L.Rev. 479, 482.</p>\n<p>The plurality today "decline[s] to depart from [the] rationale" of <em>Wade</em> and <em>Gilbert.</em> <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#690">406 U.

Hence, the accused in <em>Stovall</em> did not receive the benefit of the new exclusionary rules, because they were not applied retroactively; he was not denied their benefit because his confrontation took place before he had "been formally charged with a criminal offense."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html#691">406 U.

But surely the assistance of counsel, now established as an absolute post-indictment right, does not arise or attach because of the return of an indictment.  The confrontation of a lineup . . . cannot have a constitutional distinction based upon the lodging of a formal charge.  Every reason set forth by the Supreme Court in <em>Wade</em> . . . for the assistance of counsel post-indictment has equal or more impact when projected against a pre-indictment atmosphere.
