The <em>Hill</em> received no material injury.  The <em>World</em> sank almost immediately, carrying down with her about thirty persons.  <em>The wreck and cargo were soon afterwards abandoned to the underwriters,</em> who subsequently assigned their claims to the libellant.</p>\n<p>The account of the catastrophe, as given by the libellant, was briefly this:  that the <em>World</em> was descending the river in the ordinary channel when the <em>Hill,</em> which had been running up on the Mississippi side, came quartering out from that side, attempted to cross the river in front of the descending boat, but, being a little too late, ran into her and sank her.</p>\n<p>The libellant accounted for the accident on the ground </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 70 U. S. 259</a></p><p> that the pilot of the <em>Hill</em> failed, for want of proper watchfulness, to discover the <em>World</em> in time to avoid the collision; that he was either ignorant or disregardful of his obligations to obey signals which he ought to have obeyed; and that he maneuvered his boat with entire want of skill.</p>\n<p>The respondent admitted an attempt of the <em>Hill</em> to cross the river, but asserted that it was effected in safety and that, after the <em>Hill</em> had gained the Arkansas side, the <em>World</em> came square across the river, directly towards the <em>Hill,</em> struck her, inflicting, however, no damage, but was herself by the blow stove in and sunk.</p>\n<p>The district court, <em>in accordance with the prayer of the libel,</em> issued process <em>in rem</em> against the <em>Hill</em> and citations <em>in personam</em> against the captain, owner, and pilot.  The 15th rule in admiralty of this Court, of the Rules of 1845, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] it should be said, allows a libellant, in all cases of collision, "to proceed against the ship and master, or against the ship alone, or against the master or the owner alone, <em>in personam.</em>"</p>\n<p>The owners of the <em>Hill, of whom the master was one,</em> put in a claim, and on the same day the boat was released on a bond conditioned that <em>the claimants and sureties should abide by all the orders of the court and pay the libellant the amount awarded by the final decree.</em>  The claimants immediately afterwards filed an exception to the libel for misjoinder of owners and pilot in a proceeding against the vessel and master, and prayed that the libel be dismissed.  The court ruled that an action against the owners and pilot could not be joined with the proceeding <em>in rem,</em> and that the libellant must elect which remedy he would pursue, and he having elected to proceed <em>in rem</em> against the steamboat and <em>in personam</em> against the master, it was ordered that the libel be dismissed as to the owners and pilot and sustained against the steamboat and master.

It embraced a number of questions, as whether a sufficient watch had been kept -- sufficient and proper signals given -- whether the engines had been rightly worked when the boats approached -- whether certain officers of the <em>World</em> were or were not intoxicated -- what was the character of the pilots for sobriety and skill -- and whether Henry Evans, "a flatboat pilot" on the Mississippi, who saw the collision and testified strongly that the <em>Hill</em> was to blame for it, was worthy of faith -- seven persons swearing that he was not, and twenty-two that he was.  And finally, whereabouts exactly in a bend of the river the collision took place, and what topographical inference could be made from the hydrographical fact that portions of the <em>World\'s</em> cargo had floated to a particular spot of the shore, and that cattle which had been on the boat were found the next morning walking contemplatively in the State of Mississippi, and not in the opposite one of Arkansas.</p>\n<p>The district court decreed for the libellants ($52,500), <em>a decree</em> which the circuit court, on full consideration and after giving an opinion at large, which the record contained, <em>affirmed</em> with interest and costs.</p>\n<p>After the decree in the circuit court, a motion was made for a rehearing, "upon the ground that the court had erred in its view of the evidence and that the damages ought to be apportioned."  This motion was refused, Campbell, J., who gave its opinion, saying:</p>\n<p>"I have considered the evidence with much care; it is very conflicting, and an opinion founded upon one portion of it must necessarily be hostile to conclusions which have their support in another portion.

S. 266</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRIER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The libel in this suit was originally against the steamboat <em>Hill</em> and against the master, who was part owner, and also against the pilot.  It was amended in the district court by dismissing it as to the pilot, and sustained as against the vessel and the master or owner.  The allowance of this amendment was within the discretion of the court, and was very proper.  The objection that a libel <em>in rem</em> against a vessel and <em>in personam</em> against the owner cannot be joined was properly overruled, as it was in conformity with the 15th rule in admiralty as established by this Court.</p>\n<p>It has been objected here that the allowance of the amendment was injurious to the sureties in the bond given for the property.  But this objection is without foundation, as their liability was neither increased nor diminished.  "Every person bailing such property is considered as holding it subject to all legal dispositions of the court." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="267">Page 70 U. S. 267</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It has been contended also that the right of the libellant to sustain this action ceased by his abandonment to the underwriters.  The circuit court very properly ruled that as the libellant was the owner and master of the steamer <em>World,</em> he was the bailee of the cargo, and so responsible to the shippers or insurers for the safe transportation and delivery thereof, and to fulfill his obligations and secure his reward, he was entitled to possession, and might maintain an action for its destruction. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>"The respondent is not presumed to know or bound to inquire as to the relative equities of parties claiming the damages.  He is bound to make satisfaction for the injury he has done.  When he has once made it to the injured parties, he cannot be made liable to another suit at the instance of any merely equitable claimant. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>The question of merits was the next question argued.</p>\n<p>During the five years in which this case was pending in the district and circuit courts, more than a hundred depositions have been taken.  In these there is the usual conflict of testimony which always attends such cases.  The issue is one entirely of fact and depending on the credibility of witnesses.  The district and circuit courts, after patient investigation of the testimony, concur in the opinion that the libellant has fully established his case.  The record contains the opinion delivered by the learned judge of the circuit court, which fully vindicates the correctness of his decree.</p>\n<p>It would be a very tedious as well as a very unprofitable task to again examine and compare the conflicting statements of the witnesses in this volume of depositions.  And even if we could make our opinion intelligible, the case could never be a precedent for any other case, or worth the trouble of understanding.</p>\n<p>It is enough to say that we find ample testimony to support the decision, if believed, and that we again repeat what we have often before decided, that in such cases, parties </p><p><a class="page-number" name="268">Page 70 U. S. 268</a></p><p> should not appeal to this Court with any expectation that we will reverse the decision of the courts below, because counsel can find in the mass of conflicting testimony enough to support the allegations of the appellant, if the testimony of the appellee be entirely disregarded, or by attacking the character of his witnesses when the truth of their testimony has been sustained by the opinions of both the courts below.  Parties ought not to expect this Court to revise their decrees merely on a doubt raised in our minds as to the correctness of their judgment, on the credibility of witnesses, or the weight of conflicting testimony.  In the present case, we see no reason to doubt the correctness of the decision of the circuit court, which is accordingly</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>3 How. vi.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>The Schooner Harmony,</em> 1 Gallison, quoting <em>King v.
