I would vacate petitioner\'s conviction as well as his sentence and thereby permit the Court of Criminal Appeals to review the case afresh. That court is free, of course, after appropriate consideration and if the circumstances warrant, to reinstate the conviction.

The crucial part of this statement appears on pages 137-140 of the trial transcript. According to Sheriff Ingram, the Petitioner advised him that, when he started walking away from the victim\'s pickup, he observed his co- defendant Goforth, place \'some paper or something\' under the front seat of the pickup (Tr. 139).
