Argued February 23, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 3, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">The Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) authorizes the payment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States absent a showing by the Government that its position in the underlying litigation \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  Section 2412(d)(1)(B) sets a deadline of 30 days after final judgment for the filing of a fee application and directs that the application include: (1) a showing that the applicant is a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) a showing that the applicant is \xe2\x80\x9celigible to receive an award\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) a statement of \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount sought, including an itemized statement from any attorney \xe2\x80\xa6 stating the actual time expended and the rate\xe2\x80\x9d charged.  Section 2412(d)(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence further requires the applicant to \xe2\x80\x9callege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Scarborough prevailed before the Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims (CAVC) in an action for disability benefits against respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs.  Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s counsel filed a timely application for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs pursuant to \xc2\xa72412(d), showing that Scarborough was the prevailing party in the underlying litigation and was eligible to receive an award.  Counsel also stated the total amount sought, and itemized hours and rates of work.  But counsel failed initially to allege, in addition, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B).  The Secretary moved to dismiss the application on the ground that the CAVC lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to award fees because Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had failed to make the required no-substantial-justification allegation.  Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s counsel immediately filed an amended application adding that allegation.  In the interim between the initial filing and the amendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing period had expired.  For that sole reason, the CAVC dismissed Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s fee application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In affirming, the Federal Circuit initially held that EAJA plainly and unambiguously requires a party seeking fees under \xc2\xa72412(d) to submit an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day time limit.  This Court granted certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case in light of <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Lynchburg College,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/106/index.html">535 U. S. 106</a>.  In <em>Edelman</em>, the Court had upheld an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation allowing amendment of an employment discrimination charge, timely filed under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to add, after the filing deadline, the required, but initially absent, verification.  Title VII, the Court explained, permitted \xe2\x80\x9crelation back\xe2\x80\x9d of a verification missing from an original filing.  <em>Id</em>., at 115\xe2\x80\x93118.  On remand, the Federal Circuit adhered to its earlier decision, distinguishing <em>Edelman </em>on the ground that, in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial scheme, laypersons often initiate the process, whereas EAJA is directed to attorneys.  The appeals court also observed that the timely filing and verification requirements at issue in <em>Edelman</em> appear in separate statutory provisions, while EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutory provision.  The Federal Circuit also distinguished the holding in <em>Becker</em> v. <em>Montgomery,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/757/index.html">532 U. S. 757</a>, that a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to hand sign a timely filed notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect.  This Court had noted in <em>Becker</em>, the Federal Circuit pointed out, that the timing and signature requirements there at issue were found in separate rules.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A timely fee application, pursuant to \xc2\xa72412(d), may be amended after the 30-day filing period has run to cure an initial failure to allege that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position in the underlying litigation lacked substantial justification.  Thus, Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s fee application, as amended, qualifies for consideration and determination on the merits.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Whether Scarborough is time barred by \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) from gaining the fee award authorized by \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) does not concern the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubject-matter jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it concerns a mode of relief (costs including legal fees) ancillary to the judgment of a court that has plenary \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction of [the civil] action\xe2\x80\x9d in which the fee application is made.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72412(b) and (d)(1)(A); 38 U. S. C. \xc2\xa77252(a).  More particularly, the current dispute presents a question of time.  The issue is not whether, but when, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee applicant to \xe2\x80\x9callege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d not for such claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority.  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, 540 U. S.___ , ___ (slip op., at 10).  Section 2412(d)(1)(B) does not describe what classes of cases the CAVC is competent to adjudicate, but relates only to postjudgment proceedings auxiliary to cases already within that court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Unlike the \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must <em>show</em> (his \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d status, \xe2\x80\x9celigib[ility] to receive an award,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount sought, including an itemized statement\xe2\x80\x9d), the required \xe2\x80\x9cnot substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d allegation imposes no proof burden on the fee applicant, but is simply an allegation or pleading requirement.  So understood, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s pleading burden is akin to <em>Becker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s signature requirement and <em>Edelman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s verification requirement.  Like those requirements, EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s ten-word \xe2\x80\x9cnot substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d allegation is a \xe2\x80\x9cthink twice\xe2\x80\x9d prescription that \xe2\x80\x9cstem[s]<em> </em>the urge to litigate irresponsibly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Edelman</em>, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, the allegation functions to shift the burden to the Government to prove that its position in the underlying litigation \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  The allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the Government is aware, from the moment a fee application is filed, that to defeat the application on the merits, it will have to prove its position \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  A failure to make the allegation, therefore, should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is applying for fees, from what judgment, and to which court.  <em>Becker</em>, 532 U. S., at 767.  Moreover, because Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s statutory contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by an EAJA award, see 38 U. S. C. \xc2\xa75904(d)(1); Fee Agreements, note following 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72412, allowing the curative amendment benefits the complainant directly, and is not fairly described as simply a boon for his counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the relation-back regime, as now codified in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15(c), is out of place in this context because that Rule governs \xe2\x80\x9cpleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that does not encompass fee applications.  In <em>Becker</em> and <em>Edelman,</em> the Court approved application of the relation-back doctrine to a notice of appeal and an EEOC discrimination charge, neither of which is a \xe2\x80\x9cpleading\xe2\x80\x9d under the Federal Rules.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9crelation back\xe2\x80\x9d was not an invention of the federal rulemakers.  This Court applied the doctrine well before the Federal Rules became effective, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>New York Central &amp; Hudson River R. Co.</em> v. <em>Kinney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/260/340/index.html">260 U. S. 340</a>, 346.  Thus, the relation-back doctrine properly guides the Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination here: The amended application \xe2\x80\x9carose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth\xe2\x80\x9d in the initial application.  Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2).  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court rejects the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that \xc2\xa72412\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity from liability for fees is conditioned on the fee applicant\xe2\x80\x99s meticulous compliance with each and every \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) requirement within 30 days of final judgment, including the allegation that that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 position \xe2\x80\x9cwas not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 95, and <em>Franconia Associates</em> v. <em>United States, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/536/129/index.html">536 U. S. 129</a>, 145\xe2\x80\x94in which the Court recognized that limitation principles generally apply to the Government in the same way they apply to private parties\xe2\x80\x94are enlightening on this issue.  The Government asserts unpersuasively that <em>Irwin</em> and <em>Franconia </em>do not bear on this case because \xc2\xa72412(d) authorizes fee awards against it under rules that have no analogue in private litigation.  Because many statutes that create claims for relief against the United States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants, <em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent.  In any event, \xc2\xa72412(d) is analogous to federal \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d fee-shifting statutes that are applicable to suits between private litigants.  Finally, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion will not expose the Government to any unfair imposition.  The Government has never argued that it will be prejudiced if Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnot substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d allegation is permitted to relate back to his timely filed fee application.  Moreover, a showing of prejudice should preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in the first place.  EAJA itself also has a built-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A) disallows fees where \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances make an award unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">319 F.\xc2\xa03d 1346, reversed and remanded.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ginsburg, J., delivered the opinion of the Court, in which Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Stevens, O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, Souter, and Breyer, JJ., joined.

Relevant here, EAJA authorizes the payment of fees to a prevailing party in an action against the United States; the Government may defeat this entitlement by showing that its position in the underlying litigation \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  28\xc2\xa0U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  In a further provision, \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B), the Act prescribes the timing and content of applications seeking fees authorized by \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  Section 2412(d)(1)(B) specifies as the time for filing the application \xe2\x80\x9cwithin thirty days of final judgment in the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the same sentence, the provision identifies the application\xe2\x80\x99s contents, in particular, a showing that the applicant is a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d who meets the financial eligibility condition (in this case, a net worth that \xe2\x80\x9cdid not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the \xe2\x80\xa6 action was filed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(2)(B)); and a statement of the amount sought, with an accompanying itemization.

But counsel failed initially to allege, in addition, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pointing to that omission, the Government moved to dismiss the fee application.  Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s counsel immediately filed an amended application adding that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to the underlying claim for benefits \xe2\x80\x9cwas not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the interim between the initial filing and the amendment, however, the 30-day fee application filing period had expired.

Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s applications, both the first and the second, failed to allege \xe2\x80\x9cthat the position of the United States [in the underlying litigation] was not substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B).  In all other respects, it is not here disputed, Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s filings met the \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) application-content\nrequirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Again, the Clerk of the CAVC found the application premature, but this time retained it, unfiled, until the time to appeal the CAVC\xe2\x80\x99s judgment had expired.  The Clerk then filed the fee application and notified the respondent Secretary of Veterans Affairs that his response was due within 30 days.  App. 10.  After receiving and exhausting a 30-day extension of time to respond, the Secretary moved to dismiss the fee application.  <em>Id</em>., at 2.  The CAVC lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to award fees under \xc2\xa72412(d), the Secretary maintained, because Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had failed to allege, within 30 days of the final judgment, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the position of the United States was not substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B).

Simultaneously, Scarborough opposed the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss, urging that the omission initially to plead \xe2\x80\x9cno substantial justification\xe2\x80\x9d could be cured by amendment and was not a jurisdictional defect.  CAVC Record, Doc. 13, pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x80\x932.  On June 14, 2000, the CAVC dismissed Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s fee application on the ground asserted by the Government.  <em>Scarborough </em>v. <em>West</em>, 13 Vet. App. 530 <em>(per curiam)</em>.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A year-and-a-half later, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed.  273 F.\xc2\xa03d 1087 (2001).  EAJA must be construed strictly in favor of the Government, the Court of Appeals stated, because the Act effects a partial waiver of sovereign immunity, rendering the United States liable for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees when the Government otherwise would not be required to pay.  <em>Id</em>., at 1089\xe2\x80\x931090.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he language of the EAJA statute is plain and unambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d; it requires a party seeking fees under \xc2\xa72412(d) to submit an application, including all enumerated allegations, within the 30-day time limit.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1090 (citing \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B)).  The court acknowledged that the Courts of Appeals for the Third and Eleventh Circuits read \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) to require only that the fee application be <em>filed</em> within 30 days; those Circuits allow later amendments to perfect the application-content specifications set out in \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B).  <em>Id</em>., at 1090\xe2\x80\x931091 (citing <em>Dunn </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 775 F.\xc2\xa02d 99, 104 (CA3 1985) (applicant need not submit within 30 days an itemized statement accounting for the amount sought), and <em>Singleton </em>v. <em>Apfel</em>, 231 F.\xc2\xa03d 853, 858 (CA11 2000) (applicant need not allege within 30 days that her net worth did not exceed $2 million or that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position was not substantially justified)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Circuit also distinguished its own decision in <em>Bazalo </em>v. <em>West</em>, 150 F.\xc2\xa03d 1380 (1998), which had held that an applicant may supplement an EAJA application to cure an initial failure to show eligibility for fees.  The applicant in <em>Bazalo</em> had failed to allege and establish, within the 30-day period, that he was a qualified \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa72412(d), <em>i.e.</em>, that his \xe2\x80\x9cnet worth did not exceed $2,000,000 at the time the civil action was filed,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(2)(B).  <em>Id.,</em> at 1381.  <em>Bazalo</em> differed from Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s case, the Court of Appeals said, because the <em>Bazalo</em> applicant had essentially complied with the basic pleading requirements and simply needed to \xe2\x80\x9cfles[h] out \xe2\x80\xa6 the details.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1092.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s initial petition for a writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Edelman</em> v. <em>Lynchburg College,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/106/index.html">535 U. S. 106</a> (2002).  See <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/920/index.html">536 U. S. 920</a> (2002).  <em>Edelman</em> concerned an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) regulation relating to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; the regulation allowed amendment of an employment discrimination charge, timely filed with the EEOC, to add, after the filing deadline had passed, the required, but initially absent, verification.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(b) (requiring charges to \xe2\x80\x9cbe in writing under oath or affirmation\xe2\x80\x9d).  We upheld the regulation.  Title VII, we explained, in line with \xe2\x80\x9ca long history of practice,\xe2\x80\x9d 535 U. S., at 116, permitted \xe2\x80\x9crelation back\xe2\x80\x9d of a verification missing from an original filing, <em>id</em>., at 115\xe2\x80\x93118.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand of Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s case to the same Federal Circuit panel, two of the three judges adhered to the panel\xe2\x80\x99s unanimous earlier decision and distinguished <em>Edelman</em>.  319 F.\xc2\xa03d 1346 (2003).  Unlike the civil rights statute in <em>Edelman</em>, the Court of Appeals majority said, a \xe2\x80\x9cremedial scheme\xe2\x80\x9d in which laypersons often initiate the process, EAJA is directed to attorneys, who do not need \xe2\x80\x9cpaternalistic protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1353 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s majority further observed that the two requirements at issue in <em>Edelman\xe2\x80\x94</em>the timely filing of a discrimination charge and the verification of that charge\xe2\x80\x94appear in separate statutory provisions.  In contrast, EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s 30-day filing deadline and the contents required for a fee application are detailed in the same statutory provision.  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1353.  The majority also distinguished <em>Becker</em> v. <em>Montgomery,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/757/index.html">532 U. S. 757</a> (2001), in which we held that a <em>pro se</em> litigant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to hand sign a timely filed notice of appeal is a nonjurisdictional, and therefore curable, defect.  This Court had noted in <em>Becker</em>, the Federal Circuit majority pointed out, that the timing and signature requirements there at issue were found in separate rules.  See 319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1353.  The Federal Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion next distinguished <em>Edelman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s verification requirement and <em>Becker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s signature requirement from EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s no-substantial-justification-allegation requirement on this additional ground: \xe2\x80\x9c[The] \xe2\x80\xa6 substantial justification [allegation] is not a pro forma requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d for it \xe2\x80\x9crequires an applicant to analyze the case record\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cis one portion of the basis of the award itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1353.  Reiterating that the no-substantial-justification allegation is \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional,\xe2\x80\x9d the Federal Circuit held that Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c[n]oncompliance [was] fatal\xe2\x80\x9d and dismissed the application.  <em>Id</em>., at 1355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Judge Mayer dissented.  The no-substantial-justification allegation, he found, \xe2\x80\x9cis akin to the verification requirement of <em>Edelman</em> and the signature requirement of <em>Becker</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1356.  In addition to the pathmarking <em>Edelman</em> and <em>Becker</em> decisions, he regarded this case as \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially the same case as <em>Bazalo</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  319 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1356.  In light of EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose \xe2\x80\x9cto eliminate the financial disincentive for those who would defend against unjustified governmental action and thereby deter it,\xe2\x80\x9d Chief Judge Mayer concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cit is apparent that Congress did not intend the EAJA application process to be an additional deterrent to the vindication of rights because of a missing averment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/986/index.html">539 U.

See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72412(b) and (d)(1)(A) (costs including fees awardable \xe2\x80\x9cin any civil action\xe2\x80\x9d brought against the United States \xe2\x80\x9cin any court having jurisdiction of [that] action\xe2\x80\x9d); 38 U.

The issue is not whether, but when, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) and (B) require a fee applicant to \xe2\x80\x9callege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we recently observed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cCourts, including this Court \xe2\x80\xa6 have more than occasionally [mis]used the term \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99 to describe emphatic time prescriptions in [claim processing] rules \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Classifying time prescriptions, even rigid ones, under the heading \xe2\x80\x98subject matter jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x99 can be confounding.  Clarity would be facilitated if courts and litigants used the label \xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99 not for claim-processing rules, but only for prescriptions delineating the classes of cases (subject-matter jurisdiction) and the persons (personal jurisdiction) falling within a court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Kontrick</em> v. <em>Ryan</em>, 540 U.

Accordingly, as <em>Kontrick</em> indicates, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s 30-day deadline for fee applications and its application-content specifications are not properly typed \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn next to the reason why Congress required the fee applicant to \xe2\x80\x9callege\xe2\x80\x9d that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position \xe2\x80\x9cwas not substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Unlike the \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) prescriptions on what the applicant must <em>show</em> (his \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d status and \xe2\x80\x9celigib[ility] to receive an award,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount sought, including an itemized statement\xe2\x80\x9d reporting \xe2\x80\x9cthe actual time expended and the rate at which fees and other expenses were computed\xe2\x80\x9d), the required \xe2\x80\x9cnot substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d allegation imposes no proof burden on the fee applicant.  It is, as its text conveys, nothing more than an allegation or pleading requirement.  The burden of establishing \xe2\x80\x9cthat the position of the United States was substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A) indicates and courts uniformly have recognized, must be shouldered by the Government.

Complementarily, the no-substantial-justification-allegation requirement serves to ward off irresponsible litigation, <em>i.e.</em>, unreasonable or capricious fee-shifting demands.  As counsel for the Government stated at oral argument, allocating the pleading burden to fee applicants obliges them \xe2\x80\x9cto examine the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position and make a determination \xe2\x80\xa6 whether it is substantially justified or not.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; see <em>id</em>., at 19 (petitioner recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose of this allegation [is to make] a lawyer think twice\xe2\x80\x9d).  So understood, the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s burden to plead that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position \xe2\x80\x9cwas not substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d is akin to the signature requirement in <em>Becker</em> and the oath or affirmation requirement in <em>Edelman</em>.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Becker</em>, a <em>pro se</em> litigant had typed, but had neglected to hand sign, his name, as required by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a), on his timely filed notice of appeal.  532 U. S., at 760\xe2\x80\x93761, 763; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.  Although we called the rules on the timing and content of notices of appeal \xe2\x80\x9clinked jurisdictional provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Becker</em>, 532 U. S., at 765 (referring to Fed. Rules App. Proc. 3 and 4), we concluded that a litigant could add the signature required by Rule 11(a) even after the time for filing the notice had expired, 532 U. S., at 766\xe2\x80\x93767.  Rule 11(a), we observed, provides that \xe2\x80\x9comission of the signature\xe2\x80\x9d on any \xe2\x80\x9cpleading, written motion, [or] other paper\xe2\x80\x9d may be \xe2\x80\x9ccorrected promptly after being called to the attention of the attorney or party.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 532 U. S., at 764.  Permitting a late signature to perfect an appeal, we explained, was hardly pathbreaking, for \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther opinions of this Court are in full harmony with the view that imperfections in noticing an appeal should not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is appealing, from what judgment, to which appellate court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 767\xe2\x80\x93768 (citing <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Barry,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/244/index.html">502 U.

S., at 116.  <em>Edelman</em> involved an EEOC regulation permitting a Title VII discrimination charge timely filed with the agency to be amended, outside the charge-filing period, to include an omitted, but required, verification.  <em>Id</em>., at 109; see <em>supra</em>, at 8.   \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no reason,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed in sustaining the regulation, \xe2\x80\x9cto think that relation back of the oath here is any less reasonable than relation back of the signature in <em>Becker</em>.

S., at 116.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Becker</em> and <em>Edelman</em> inform our judgment in this case.  Like the signature and verification requirements, EAJA\xe2\x80\x99s ten-word \xe2\x80\x9cnot substantially justified\xe2\x80\x9d allegation is a \xe2\x80\x9cthink twice\xe2\x80\x9d prescription that \xe2\x80\x9cstem[s]<em> </em>the urge to litigate irresponsibly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Edelman</em>, 535 U. S., at 116; at the same time, the allegation functions to shift the burden to the Government to prove that its position in the underlying litigation \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  We note, too, that the allegation does not serve an essential notice-giving function; the Government is aware, from the moment a fee application is filed, that to defeat the application on the merits, it will have to prove its position \xe2\x80\x9cwas substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  As <em>Becker</em> indicates, the lapse here \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be fatal where no genuine doubt exists about who is app[lying] [for fees], from what judgment, to which \xe2\x80\xa6 court.\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U. S., at 767.  Moreover, because Scarborough\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s statutory contingent fee would be reduced dollar for dollar by an EAJA award, see 38 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75904(d)(1); Fee Agreements, note following 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412, allowing the curative amendment benefits the complainant directly, and is not fairly described as simply a boon for his counsel.  Permitting amendment thus advances Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose, in enacting EAJA, to reduce the \xe2\x80\x9cemphasi[s], virtually to the exclusion of all other issues, [on] the cost of potential litigation\xe2\x80\x9d in a party\xe2\x80\x99s decision whether to challenge unjust governmental action.

No. 96\xe2\x80\x931005, at\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government, however, maintains that the relation-back regime, as now codified in Rule 15(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, is out of place in this context, for that Rule governs \xe2\x80\x9cpleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that does not encompass fee applications.  Brief for Respondent 21; see Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 15(c)(2) (permitting relation back of amendments to pleadings when \xe2\x80\x9cthe claim or defense asserted in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set forth or attempted to be set forth in the original [timely filed] pleading\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Rule 7(a) (enumerating permitted \xe2\x80\x9cpleadings\xe2\x80\x9d).  Scarborough acknowledges that Rule 15(c) itself is directed to federal district court \xe2\x80\x9cpleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d but urges that this Court has approved application of the relation-back doctrine in analogous settings.  Brief for Petitioner 28.  Most recently, as just related, we applied the doctrine in <em>Becker</em> and <em>Edelman</em> to, respectively, a notice of appeal and an EEOC discrimination charge, neither of which is a \xe2\x80\x9cpleading\xe2\x80\x9d under the Federal Rules.  As the Government concedes, moreover, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 35\xe2\x80\x9336, \xe2\x80\x9crelation back\xe2\x80\x9d was not an invention of the federal rulemakers.

Although the petitioner had missed the filing deadline, we held that Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s statutory time limits are subject to equitable tolling, even against the Government.  498 U.

Once Congress waives sovereign immunity, we observed, judicial application of a time prescription to suits against the Government, in the same way the prescription is applicable to private suits, \xe2\x80\x9camounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Irwin</em>, 498 U.

We further stated in <em>Irwin</em> that holding the Government responsible \xe2\x80\x9cis likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful principle of interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government nevertheless maintains that <em>Irwin</em> and <em>Franconia </em>do not bear on this case, for \xe2\x80\x9cSection 2412(d) authorizes fee awards against the government under rules that have no analogue in private litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 39.  But it is hardly clear that <em>Irwin </em>demands a precise private analogue.  Litigation against the United States exists because Congress has enacted legislation creating rights against the Government, often in matters peculiar to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s engagements with private persons\xe2\x80\x94matters such as the administration of benefit programs.  Because many statutes that create claims for relief against the United States or its agencies apply only to Government defendants, <em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, \xc2\xa72412(d) is analogous to other fee-shifting provisions abrogating the general rule that each party to a lawsuit pays his own legal fees.  The provision resembles \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d fee-shifting statutes that are applicable to suits between private litigants.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U.

Moreover, a showing of prejudice should preclude operation of the relation-back doctrine in the first place.  See <em>Singleton</em>, 231 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 858 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe interests of the government and the courts will be served, however, if district courts are empowered to \xe2\x80\xa6 outright deny a request to supplement [a fee application] if the government would be prejudiced.\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, EAJA itself has a built-in check: Section 2412(d)(1)(A) disallows fees where \xe2\x80\x9cspecial circumstances make an award unjust.\xe2\x80\x9d  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

The Court should have first addressed whether, as a textual matter, the no substantial justification allegation must be made within the 30-day deadline.  I conclude that it must.  The question then becomes whether the judicial application of the relation-back doctrine is appropriate in a case such as this where the statute defines the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of sovereign immunity.  Because there is no express allowance for relation back in EAJA, I conclude that the sovereign immunity canon applies to construe strictly the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver.  The Court reaches its holding today by distorting\nthe scope of <em>Irwin</em> v. <em>Department of Veterans Affairs,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/index.html">498 U. S. 89</a> (1990), and by eviscerating that case\xe2\x80\x99s doctrinal underpinnings.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the better reading of the text of the statute is that the 30-day deadline applies to the no substantial justification allegation requirement.  The first sentence of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) states that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] party seeking an award of fees and other expenses shall, within thirty days of final judgment in the action, submit to the court an application for fees \xe2\x80\xa6 which shows\xe2\x80\x9d: (1) the applicant\xe2\x80\x99s status as a prevailing party; (2) that the applicant is\neligible to receive fees under \xc2\xa72412(d)(2)(B); and (3)\nthe itemized amount sought.  The second sentence of \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(B) provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe party shall also allege that the position of the United States was not substantially justified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In stating that the applicant \xe2\x80\x9cshall <em>also</em>\xe2\x80\x9d make the no substantial justification allegation, the second sentence links the allegation requirement with the timing and other content requirements of the first sentence.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Indeed, there is only one deadline expressly contained in the provision.  That 30-day deadline imposes a limitation on a set of requirements that petitioner must satisfy in order to receive an EAJA fee award.  Immediately following the deadline is another sentence that requires the petitioner to make the no substantial justification allegation.  Taking the provision as a whole, it is quite natural to read it as applying the 30-day deadline to all of its requirements.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  And, this reading is confirmed by numerous federal agency regulations,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] which have interpreted a nearly identical EAJA provision allowing for\nfees in adversary adjudications conducted before federal agencies.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I conclude that the no substantial justification allegation must be made within the 30-day deadline, the question becomes whether the relation-back doctrine should apply here.  The EAJA requirement for filing a timely fee application with the statutorily prescribed content is a condition on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 waiver of sovereign immunity in \xc2\xa72412(d)(1)(A).  See <em>Ardestani</em> v. <em>INS,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/index.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 137 (1991).  As such, the scope of the waiver must be strictly construed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Irwin</em>, 498 U. S., at 94; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Nordic Village, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/30/index.html">503 U.

Since the relation-back doctrine relied upon by the Court is not present in the text of the statute, under a simple application of the sovereign immunity canon, petitioner is not entitled to \xe2\x80\x9crelate-back\xe2\x80\x9d his allegation beyond the 30-day deadline.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only way the Court avoids this straightforward conclusion is by applying <em>Irwin</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Although <em>Irwin</em> does perhaps narrow the scope of the sovereign immunity canon, it does so only in limited circumstances.  In particular, where the Government is made subject to suit to the same extent and in the same manner as private parties are, <em>Irwin</em> holds that the Government is subject to the rules that are \xe2\x80\x9capplicable to private suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  498 U. S., at 95.  The Court in <em>Irwin</em>, addressing equitable tolling, explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]ime requirements in lawsuits between private litigants are customarily subject to \xe2\x80\x98equitable tolling,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nce Congress has made \xe2\x80\xa6 a waiver [of sovereign immunity], \xe2\x80\xa6 making the rule of equitable tolling applicable to suits against the Government, in the same way that it is applicable to private suits, amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (citations omitted).  The Court determined that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch a principle is likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful principle of interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding <em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope, the Court concludes: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would be diminished were it instructive only in situations with a readily identifiable private-litigation equivalent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 19.  The existence of this \xe2\x80\x9cprivate-litigation equivalent,\xe2\x80\x9d however, formed the very basis for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Irwin</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Government that there is \xe2\x80\x9cno analogue in private litigation,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 39, for the EAJA fee awards at issue here.  Section 2412(d) authorizes fee awards against the Government when there is no basis for recovery under the rules for private litigation.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Irwin</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis simply cannot apply to a proceeding against the Government when there is no analogue for it in private litigation.  Accordingly, I would apply the sovereign immunity canon to construe strictly the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s waiver and, therefore, against allowing an applicant to avoid the express statutory limitation through judicial application of the relation-back doctrine.  For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlso\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9clikewise,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Ninth New Collegiate Dictionary 75 (1991), or \xe2\x80\x9cin like manner,\xe2\x80\x9d Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 77 (6th ed. 1990).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Several Courts of Appeals explicitly require an applicant to include the no substantial justification allegation in an EAJA fee application.
