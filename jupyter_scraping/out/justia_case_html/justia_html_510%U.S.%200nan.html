Petitioner did not post the information regarding the miners\' representatives as required by 30 CFR \xc2\xa7 40.4, but complained to the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) 5 that the designation compromised its rights under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). App. 31.

The Act establishes a detailed structure for reviewing violations of "any mandatory health or safety standard, rule, order, or regulation promulgated" under the Act. \xc2\xa7814(a). A mine operator has 30 days to challenge before the Commission any citation issued under the Act, after which time an uncontested order becomes "final" and "not subject to review by any court or agency." \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 815(a) and (d).

The structure of the Mine Act, however, demonstrates that Congress intended to preclude challenges such as the present one. The Act\'s comprehensive review process does not distinguish between pre-enforcement and postenforcement challenges,</p><p>930 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 823(d)(2). The Commission exercises discretionary review over any case involving, among others, a "substantial question of law, policy or discretion," \xc2\xa7 823(d)(2)(A)(ii)(IV), and may review on its own initiative any decision "contrary to law or Commission policy" or in which "a novel question of policy has been presented," \xc2\xa7 823(d)(2)(B). Any ALJ decision not granted review by the Commission within 40 days becomes a "final decision of the Commission." \xc2\xa7 823(d)(1).</p><p>10 The statutory criteria are "the operator\'s history of previous violations, the appropriateness of such penalty to the size of the business of the operator charged, whether the operator was negligent, the effect on the operator\'s ability to continue in business, the gravity of the violation, and the demonstrated good faith of the person charged in attempting to achieve rapid compliance." 30 U.

Contrary to petitioner\'s suggestion, Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, actions before the Commission are initiated not by the Secretary but by a mine operator who claims to be aggrieved. See \xc2\xa7 815(a). The Act expressly authorizes district court jurisdiction in only two provisions, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 818(a) and 820(j), which respectively empower the <i>Secretary </i>to enjoin habitual violations of health and safety standards and to coerce payment of civil penalties.

Petitioner misconstrues \xc2\xa7 960, which bars a certain form of relief but says nothing about the appropriate forum for a challenge. Section 815(a) similarly provides only that failure timely to challenge a citation precludes review before the Commission and court of appeals; it does not suggest that district court review is otherwise available. In light of the Act\'s other provisions granting district courts jurisdiction over challenges brought only by the Secretary, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 818(a) and 820(j), petitioner\'s argument based on the maxim <i>expressio unius est exclusio alterius </i>is unpersuasive.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="210">210</a></p><p>then-existing enforcement measures.12 Under existing legislation,13 civil penalties were not always mandatory and were too low to compel compliance, and enforcement was hobbled by a cumbersome review process.14</p><p>Congress expressed particular concern that under the previous Coal Act mine operators could contest civil-penalty assessments <i>de novo </i>in federal district court once the administrative review process was complete, thereby "seriously hamper[ing] the collection of civil penalties." 15 Concluding</p><p>12 In February 1972, for example, 125 persons were killed when a mine dam broke at Buffalo Creek in West Virginia. Leg. Hist. 592. See generally G. Stern, The Buffalo Creek Disaster (1976). Ninety-one miners died of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in May 1972 at the Sunshine Silver Mine in Idaho. In July 1972, nine miners were killed in a mine fire in Blacksville, W. Va., and in March 1976, 23 miners and 3 federal inspectors died in methane gas explosions at the Scotia coal mine in Kentucky. <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>The House and Senate Committee Reports observed that these accidents resulted from hazards that were remediable and that in many cases already had been the object of repeated enforcement efforts. See generally Leg. Hist. 362, 371, 592-593, 637. The 1972 Buffalo Creek disaster, for example, occurred after the mine had been assessed over $1.5 million in penalties, "not one cent of which had been paid." <i>Id., </i>at 631. Sixty-two ventilation violations were noted in the two years prior to the Scotia gas explosions, but the imposed penalties failed to coerce compliance. <i>Id., </i>at 629-630.</p><p>13 The 1977 Mine Act renamed and amended the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act of 1969 (Coal Act), 91 Stat. 1290, and repealed the Federal Metal and Nonmetallic Mine Safety Act of 1966, <i>id., </i>at 1322.</p><p>14 The Senate Report found it "unacceptable that years after enactment of these mine safety laws ... [m]ine operators still find it cheaper to pay minimal civil penalties than to make the capital investments necessary to adequately abate unsafe or unhealthy conditions, and there is still no means by which the government can bring habitual and chronic violators of the law into compliance." Leg. Hist. 592; see also <i>id., </i>at 597.</p><p><i>15Id., </i>at 633. The Senate Report explained:</p><p>"The Committee firmly believes that to effectively induce compliance, the penalty must be paid by the operator in reasonably close time proximity to the occurrence of the underlying violation.

The Act authorized the Secretary to compel payment of penalties and to enjoin habitual health and safety violators in federal district court. See Leg. Hist. 627; 30 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 820(j) and 818(a). Assessment of civil penalties was made mandatory for all mines, and Congress expressly eliminated the power of a mine operator to challenge a final penalty assessment <i>de </i>novo in district court. Cf. <i>Whitney Nat. Bank, </i>379 U. S., at 420 (that "Congress rejected a proposal for a <i>de novo </i>review in the district courts of Board decisions" supports a finding of district court preclusion).16 We consider the legislative history and these amendments to be persuasive evidence that Congress intended to direct ordinary challenges under the Mine Act to a single review process.</p><p>tors have the right to seek judicial review of penalty determinations, and may request a de novo trial on the issues in the U. S. District Courts. This encourages operators who are not pre-disposed to voluntarily pay assessed penalties to pursue cases through the elaborate administrative procedure and then to seek redress in the Courts. Since the District Courts are still reluctant to schedule trials on these cases, and the Department of Justice has been reluctant to pursue such cases in the courts, the matters generally languish at that stage, and the penalties go uncollected." <i>Id., </i>at 604.</p><p>16 The Senate Report\'s citation, see Leg. Rist. 602, of <i>Bituminous Coal Operators\' Assn. </i>v. <i>Secretary of Interior, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/547/240/">547 F.2d 240</a> <i>(CA4 </i>1977) (holding that pre-enforcement district court challenges were not precluded under the 1969 Coal Act), does not support petitioner\'s claim that Congress intended to preserve district court jurisdiction over pre-enforcement suits.

In that case, this Court held that statutory review of certain provisions of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1040, as amended by the Drug Amendments of 1962, 76 Stat. 780, 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 301 <i>et seq., </i>did not preclude district court jurisdiction over a preenforcement challenge to regulations promulgated under separate provisions of that Act. In so holding, the Court found that the presence of a statutory saving clause, see 387 U. S., at 144, and the statute\'s legislative history demonstrated "rather conclusively that the specific review provisions were designed to give an additional remedy and not to cut down more traditional channels of review," <i>id., </i>at 142. It concluded that Congress\' primary concern in adopting the administrative-review procedures was to supplement review of specific agency determinations over which traditional forms of review might be inadequate. <i>Id., </i>at 142-144. Contrary to petitioner\'s contentions, no comparable statutory language or legislative intent is present here. Indeed, as discussed above, the Mine Act\'s text and legislative history suggest precisely the opposite. The prospect that federal jurisdiction might thwart effective enforcement of the statute also was less immediate in <i>Abbott Laboratories, </i>since the <i>Abbott </i>petitioners did not attempt to stay enforcement of the challenged regulation pending judicial review, as petitioner did here. <i>Id., </i>at 155-156.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>We turn to the question whether petitioner\'s claims are of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within this statutory structure.

See <i>Block </i>v. <i>Community Nutrition Institute, </i>467 U. S., at 351. Petitioner\'s claims are "pre-enforcement" only because the company sued before a citation was issued, and its claims turn on a question of statutory interpretation that can be meaningfully reviewed under the Mine Act. Had petitioner persisted in its refusal to post the designation, the Secretary would have been required to issue a citation and commence enforcement proceedings. See 30 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 815(a) and 820 (1988 ed. and Supp. IV). Nothing in the language and structure of the Act or its legislative history suggests that Congress intended to allow mine operators to evade the statutory-review process by enjoining the Secretary from commencing enforcement proceedings, as petitioner sought to do here. To uphold the District Court\'s jurisdiction in these circumstances would be inimical to the structure and the purposes of the Mine Act.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>Petitioner finally contends, in the alternative, that due process requires district court review because the absence of pre-enforcement declaratory relief before the Commission will subject petitioner to serious and irreparable harm. We need not consider this claim, however, because neither compliance with, nor continued violation of, the statute will subject petitioner to a serious prehearing deprivation.</p><p>The record before us contains no evidence that petitioner will be subject to serious harm if it complies with 30 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 813(f) and 30 CFR pt. 40 by posting the designations, and the potential for abuse of the miners\' representative position appears limited. As the district manager of the MSHA stated to petitioner, designation as a miners\' representative</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="217">217</a></p><p>does not convey "an uncontrolled access right to the mine property to engage in any activity that the miners\' representative wants." App. 49. Statutory inspections of petitioner\'s mine need occur only twice annually and are conducted with representatives of the Secretary and the operator. Because the miners\' representative cannot receive advance notice of an inspection, the ability of the nonemployee UMWA designees to exercise these limited walkaround rights is speculative. See Tr. of Oral Arg. 31; Brief for International Union, UMWA, as <i>Amicus Curiae </i>11, n. 2. Although it is possible that a miners\' representative could abuse his privileges, we agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioner has failed to demonstrate that such abuse, entirely hypothetical on the record before us, cannot be remedied on an individual basis under the Mine Act. See 969 F. 2d, at 976-977, and n. 6; <i>Utah Power </i>&amp; <i>Light Co. </i>v. <i>Secretary of Labor, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/897/447/">897 F.2d 447</a>, 452 (CAlO 1990); <i>Kerr-McGee Coal Corp. </i>v. <i>Secretary, </i>15 F.

S. 527 (1992). The right of employers to exclude union organizers from their private property emanates from state common law, and while this right is not superseded by the NLRA, nothing in the NLRA expressly protects it. To the contrary, this Court consistently has maintained that the NLRA may entitle union employees to obtain access to an employer\'s property under limited circumstances. See <i>id., </i>at 537; <i>NLRB </i>v. <i>Babcock </i>&amp; <i>Wilcox Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/351/105/case.html">351 U. S. 105</a>, 112 (1956). Moreover, in a related context, the Court has held that Congress\' interest in regulating the mining industry may justify limiting the private property interests of mine operators. See <i>Donovan </i>v. <i>Dewey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/594/case.html">452 U.

C. \xc2\xa7 801 <i>et seq. </i>(1988 ed. and Supp. IV), which is found to "confir[m]," <i>ante, </i>at 209, the Court\'s interpretation of the statute. I find that discussion unnecessary to the decision. It serves to maintain the illusion that legislative history is an important factor in this Court\'s deciding of cases, as opposed to an omnipresent makeweight for decisions arrived at on other grounds. See <i>Wisconsin Public Intervenor </i>v. <i>Mortier, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/case.html">501 U.

That is true enough as to the claims disposed of in Part III, but quite obviously not true as to the constitutional claim disposed of in Part IV; which is rejected not on preclusion grounds but on the merits. * The alleged impediments to entertaining that claim must be considered. I t suffices here to say that I do not consider them valid.</p><p>*1 understand Part IV to be dealing with the issue of whether the exclusion of judicial review adjudged in Part III is constitutional. Even though, as Part III has determined, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Amendments Act of 1977 precludes judicial review of the agency action that is the subject of the present suit, the district court retains jurisdiction under the grant of general federal-question jurisdiction, see 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1331, for the limited purpose of determining whether that preclusion <i>it</i>self is unconstitutional and hence ineffective. Cf. <i>Ng Fung Ho </i>v. <i>White, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/276/case.html">259 U. S. 276</a>, 282-285 (1922) (permitting habeas corpus review of deportation orders); <i>Battaglia </i>v. <i>General Motors Corp., </i>169 F.2d 254, 257 <i>(CA2 </i>1948).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="220">220</a></p><p>And finally, as to Part IV: The Court holds that the preclusion of review is constitutional "because neither compliance with, nor continued violation of, the statute will subject petitioner to a serious prehearing deprivation." <i>Ante, </i>at 216. I presume this means that any such deprivation will be <i>de </i>minimis (since I know of no doctrine which lets stand unconstitutional injury that is more than <i>de minimis </i>but short of some other criterion of gravity). It seems to me, however, that compliance with the inspection regulations <i>will </i>cause petitioner more than <i>de minimis </i>harm (assuming, as we must in evaluating the harm resulting from compliance, that petitioner is correct on the merits of his claims). Compliance will compel the company to allow union officials to enter its premises (and in a position of apparent authority, at that), notwithstanding its common-law right to exclude them, cf. <i>Lechmere, Inc. </i>v. <i>NLRB, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/527/case.html">502 U. S. 527</a>, 534-535 (1992). And compliance will provide at least some confidential business information to officers of the union. (The UMW A\'s contention, on which the Court relies, that it is "speculative" whether a nonemployee miners\' representative will be able to accompany the walk-arounds means only that such a representative may not <i>always </i>be able to do so. He will surely <i>often </i>be able to do so, since the statute <i>requires </i>that he "be given an opportunity to accompany" the inspector. 30 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 813(f).)</p><p>In my view, however, the preclusion of pre-enforcement judicial review is constitutional <i>whether or not </i>compliance produces irreparable harm-at least if a summary penalty does not cause irreparable harm <i>(e. </i>g., if it is a recoverable summary fine) or if judicial review <i>is </i>provided before a penalty for noncompliance can be imposed. (The latter condition exists here, as it does in most cases, because the penalty for noncompliance can only be imposed in court.) Were it otherwise, the availability of pre-enforcement challenges would have to be the rule rather than the exception, since complying with a regulation later held invalid almost <i>always</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="221">221</a></p><p>produces the irreparable harm of nonrecoverable compliance costs. Petitioner\'s claim is that the imposition of a choice between (1) complying with what the Government says to be the law, and (2) risking potential penalties (without a prior opportunity to challenge the law in district court) denies due process. This is similar to the constitutional challenge brought in the line of cases beginning with <i>Ex parte Young, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/209/123/case.html">209 U. S. 123</a> (1908), but with one crucial difference. As the Court notes, see <i>ante, </i>at 217-218, petitioner, unlike the plaintiff in <i>Young, </i>had the option of complying <i>and then </i>bringing a judicial challenge. The constitutional defect in <i>Young </i>was that the dilemma of either obeying the law and thereby forgoing any possibility of judicial review, or risking "enormous" and "severe" penalties, effectively cut off all access to the courts. See 209 U. S., at 146-148. That constitutional problem does not exist here, nor does any other of which I am aware. Cf. <i>Bailey </i>v. <i>George, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/16/case.html">259 U. S. 16</a>, 19 (1922). I would decide the second constitutional challenge (Part IV) on the simple grounds that the company can obtain judicial review if it complies with the agency\'s request, and can obtain pre sanction judicial review if it does not.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
