The main evidence at his trial in California state court came from statements Clair made to his former girlfriend in a conversation that she secretly recorded for the police.  He was convicted and sentenced to death, and his verdict was upheld on direct review.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1994, Clair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel, which the District Court granted under \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599.  That statute entitles indigent capital habeas petitioners like Clair to appointed counsel.  It also contemplates that appointed counsel may be \xe2\x80\x9creplaced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. upon motion of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73599(e), but it does not specify a standard for district courts to use in evaluating those motions.  Clair\xe2\x80\x99s counsel filed his initial habeas petition in 1994, and in the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, when two associates from the firm representing Clair moved to the Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), the FPD was substituted as counsel of record.  The District Court held an evidentiary hearing on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted their post-hearing briefs by February 2005.  The court subsequently told the parties that it did not wish to receive further material about the petition.  In March, Clair moved to substitute counsel, claiming that his attorneys were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, not to prove his innocence.  After the court asked the parties to address the motion, Clair\xe2\x80\x99s counsel informed it that they had met with Clair and that he wanted the FPD to continue representing him.  The court accordingly decided that it would take no action.  Six weeks later, however, Clair filed another substitution motion, adding one more charge to his earlier claims: that his private investigator had discovered that certain physical evidence from the crime scene had never been fully tested, but that Clair\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys had done nothing to analyze this evidence or follow up on its discovery.  The court denied the renewed motion without further inquiry.  On the same day, it also denied Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClair sought review of his substitution motion pro se, and the FPD appealed the habeas ruling.  The Ninth Circuit asked the FPD to address whether substitution was now warranted, and after the FPD informed the court that the attorney-client relationship had broken down, the court provided Clair with a new lawyer.  Clair then asked the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.  The District Court rejected his request, and Clair appealed.  Consolidating his appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of both his substitution request and his habeas petition.  Holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard used in non-capital cases, see \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A, should govern substitution motions like Clair\xe2\x80\x99s, it ruled that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second letter.  Because Clair had already received new counsel on appeal, the court decided the best remedy was to treat Clair\xe2\x80\x99s new counsel as though he had been appointed in June 2005 and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition in light of new evidence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0When evaluating motions to substitute counsel in capital cases under \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599, courts should employ the same \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard that applies in non-capital cases under \xc2\xa73006A.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0Although \xc2\xa73599 guarantees that indigent capital defendants and petitioners seeking federal habeas relief in capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel, see, e.g., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e), and contemplates that an appointed attorney may be \xe2\x80\x9creplaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s own motion or upon motion of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73599(e), the statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.  Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that district courts should use the \xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard of \xc2\xa73006A, which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation.  By contrast, the State contends that an appointed lawyer can only be replaced when the defendant has suffered an \xe2\x80\x9cactual or constructive denial\xe2\x80\x9d of counsel\xe2\x80\x94that is, when the lawyer lacks the requisite statutory qualifications, has a conflict of interest, or has completely abandoned the client.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court adopts Clair\xe2\x80\x99s approach, based on the history of \xc2\xa73599.  Before 1988, \xc2\xa73006A governed both capital and non-capital cases, authorizing courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners and providing that in all cases in which a court had appointed counsel, substitution motions should be decided \xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73006A(c).  Thus, a court in those days would have used that standard to evaluate a request like Clair\xe2\x80\x99s.  In 1988, Congress enacted what is now \xc2\xa73599, thus displacing \xc2\xa73006A for persons facing execution.  The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation.  Habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, see \xc2\xa73599(a)(2), and in multiple ways the statute aims to improve the quality of their representation: it provides them with more experienced counsel than \xc2\xa73006A demands, authorizes higher rates of compensation, and provides more money for investigative and expert services.  These measures \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary\xe2\x80\x9d in all capital proceedings to foster \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  McFarland v. Scott, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 849\n.  Given this context, the Court cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would make it more difficult for those facing capital punishment to substitute counsel.  Adopting a more stringent test than \xc2\xa73006A\xe2\x80\x99s would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and non-capital defendants still have, to handle serious rep- resentational problems.  By contrast, utilizing \xc2\xa73006A\xe2\x80\x99s standard comports with the myriad ways that \xc2\xa73599 seeks to promote effective representation for persons facing capital punishment.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x939.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The dearth of support for the State\xe2\x80\x99s alternative standard reinforces this conclusion.  The State concedes that Congress has not considered its standard in any context; neither has a federal court used it in any case.  The Court prefers to use a familiar standard, already known to work, than to try out a new one.  Moreover, the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test would gut \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s substitution provision, because even absent that provision courts would have an obligation to ensure that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statutory right to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation.  The State counters that only its approach comports with the rule that habeas petitioners generally have no \n \nSixth Amendment right to counsel.  But Congress declined to track that Amendment in providing statutory rights to counsel in both \xc2\xa73006A and \xc2\xa73599.  Thus, the scope of the Amendment cannot answer the statutory question presented here.  The State also contends that the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard will permit substitution motions to become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence.  But the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard takes into account whether a substitution motion will cause undue delay.

In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several relevant considerations, including: the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client.  Because a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference and may be overturned only for an abuse of discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the District Court received Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition.  Just three months earlier, Clair had written the court to complain about his attorneys.  After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his counsel had settled their dispute and turned once more to ruling on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, only to receive a second letter six weeks later.  In it Clair maintained his general assertion that his lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, but he also alleged a new and significant charge of attorney error: that counsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.  Such a charge normally would require the court to make further inquiry; a district court cannot usually rule on a substitution motion without exploring why a defendant wants new counsel.  But here, the motion\xe2\x80\x99s timing precludes a holding that the District Court abused its discretion.  The court received the letter while putting the finishing touches on its denial of Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  After years of litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and post-hearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.  All proceedings had therefore come to a close, and a new attorney could have done nothing further in the District Court.  In those circumstances, the District Court acted within its discretion in denying Clair\xe2\x80\x99s substitution motion.

We also hold that the District Court here did not abuse its discretion in denying respondent Kenneth Clair\xe2\x80\x99s motion to change counsel.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case arises from the murder of Linda Rodgers in 1984.  Rodgers resided at the home of Kai Henriksen and Margaret Hessling in Santa Ana, California.  Clair was a squatter in a vacant house next door.  About a week prior to the murder, police officers arrested Clair for burglarizing the Henriksen-Hessling home, relying on information Henriksen had provided.  On the night the police released Clair from custody, Hessling returned from an evening out to find Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 dead body in the master bedroom, naked from the waist down and beaten, stabbed, and strangled.  Some jewelry and household items were missing from the house.  See People v. Clair, 2 Cal. 4th 629, 644\xe2\x80\x93647, 828 P.\xc2\xa02d 705, 713\xe2\x80\x93714 (1992); App. to Pet. for Cert. 23\xe2\x80\x9324.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe district attorney charged Clair with Rodgers\xe2\x80\x99 murder and sought the death penalty.  No forensic evidence linked Clair to the crime; instead, the main evidence against Clair came from his former girlfriend, Pauline Flores.  Although she later recanted her testimony, see App. 36\xe2\x80\x9342, Flores stated at trial that she and Clair were walking in the neighborhood on the night of the murder and split up near the Henriksen-Hessling house.  When they reunited about an hour later, Flores recounted, Clair was carrying jewelry and other items and had blood on his right hand.  According to Flores, Clair explained to her that he had \xe2\x80\x9cjust finished beating up a woman.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clair, 2 Cal. 4th, at 647, 828 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 714.  The prosecution then introduced a tape recording of a talk between Flores and Clair several months after the murder, which Flores had made in cooperation with the police.  On that tape, Clair at one point denied committing the murder, but also made several inculpatory statements.  For example, when Flores told Clair that she had seen blood on him, he replied \xe2\x80\x9cAin\xe2\x80\x99t on me no more\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThey can\xe2\x80\x99t prove nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 53 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And in response to her continued probing, Clair explained \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hat you fail to realize, how .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. they gonna prove I was there .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ?  There ain\xe2\x80\x99t no .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fingerprints, ain\xe2\x80\x99t no .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. body seen me go in there and leave out there.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 53\xe2\x80\x9354 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The jury convicted Clair and sentenced him to death.  The California Supreme Court upheld the verdict, and this Court denied review, Clair v. California, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1063 (1993)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClair commenced federal habeas proceedings by filing a request for appointment of counsel, which the District Court granted under \xc2\xa73599.  Clair and his counsel filed an initial petition for habeas relief in 1994 and, after exhausting state remedies, an amended petition the following year.  The petition alleged more than 40 claims, involving such matters as jury selection and composition, sufficiency of the evidence, prosecutorial misconduct, nondisclosure of exculpatory materials relating to state witnesses, and ineffectiveness of trial counsel.  In the late 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, two associates from the firm representing Clair took jobs at the Office of the Federal Public Defender (FPD), and the court substituted that office as counsel of record.  The court held an evidentiary hearing on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition in August 2004, and the parties submitted post-hearing briefs by February 2005.  The court subsequently informed the parties that it viewed the briefing \xe2\x80\x9cto be complete and d[id] not wish to receive any additional material\xe2\x80\x9d about the petition.  App. 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn March 16, 2005, Clair sent a letter to the court stating that the FPD attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cno longer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ha[d] [his] best interest at hand\xe2\x80\x9d and that he did not want them to continue to represent him.  Id., at 24; see id., at 18\xe2\x80\x9325.  Clair alleged that the lawyers had repeatedly dismissed his efforts to participate in his own defense.  Prior to the evidentiary hearing, Clair wrote, he had become so frustrated with the attorneys that he enlisted a private detective to look into his case.  But the lawyers, Clair charged, refused to cooperate with the investigator; they were seeking only to overturn his death sentence, rather than to prove his innocence.  As a result, Clair felt that he and his counsel were not \xe2\x80\x9con the same team.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 23.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court responded by asking both parties to address Clair\xe2\x80\x99s motion to substitute counsel.  See id., at 18.  The State noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat the trial court does with respect to appointing counsel is within its discretion, providing the interests of justice are served.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 29.  The State further advised the court that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in [Clair\xe2\x80\x99s] letter require[d] a change\xe2\x80\x9d of counsel because the FPD lawyers had provided appropriate representation and substitution would delay the case.  Ibid.  Clair replied to the court\xe2\x80\x99s request through his FPD attorneys on April 26, 2005.  Their letter stated: \xe2\x80\x9cAfter meeting with Mr. Clair, counsel understands that Mr. Clair wants the [FPD] to continue to serve as his counsel in this case at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 27.  On the basis of that representation, the court determined that it would \xe2\x80\x9ctake no further action on the matter at this time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 33.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the issue resurfaced just six weeks after the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  On June 16, 2005, Clair wrote a second letter to the court asking for substitution of counsel.  That letter again asserted a \xe2\x80\x9ctotal break down of communication\xe2\x80\x9d between Clair and the FPD; according to Clair, he was \xe2\x80\x9cno longer able to trust anybody within that office.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 62\xe2\x80\x9363.  In explaining the source of the problem, Clair reiterated each of the points made in his prior complaint.  And then he added one more.  Clair recounted that his private investigator had recently learned that the police and dis-trict attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office were in possession of fingerprints and other physical evidence from the crime scene that had never been fully tested.  The FPD lawyers, Clair asserted, were doing nothing to analyze this evidence or otherwise follow up on its discovery.  Clair attributed this failure, too, to the FPD\xe2\x80\x99s decision to focus on his sentence, rather than on questions of guilt.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo weeks later, the District Court denied Clair\xe2\x80\x99s renewed request for substitution without further inquiry.  The court stated: \xe2\x80\x9cIt does not appear to the Court that a change of counsel is appropriate.  It appears that [Clair\xe2\x80\x99s] counsel is doing a proper job.  No conflict of interest or inadequacy of counsel is shown.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 61.  On the same day, the court denied Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition in a detailed opinion.  Clair v.

The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit instructed the FPD to address whether substitution of counsel was now warranted, and in October 2005, the FPD informed the court that \xe2\x80\x9cthe attorney-client relationship ha[d] broken down to such an extent that sub-stitution of counsel [would be] appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Attorney for Appellant\xe2\x80\x99s Response to Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sept. 15, 2005 Order, in No. 05\xe2\x80\x9399005 (CA9), Record, Doc. 9, p.\xc2\xa01.  The State did not comment or object, and the Court of Appeals provided Clair with a new lawyer going forward.  Clair then asked the District Court to vacate the denial of his habeas petition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b), arguing that he should be allowed to explore the significance of the new physical evidence for his case.  The District Court (with a new judge assigned, because the judge previously handling the case had retired) rejected that request on the ground that the new evidence did not pertain to any of the claims presented in Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Clair appealed that decision as well.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter consolidating Clair\xe2\x80\x99s appeals, the Ninth Circuit vacated the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of both Clair\xe2\x80\x99s request for new counsel and his habeas petition.  See Clair v. Ayers, 403 Fed. Appx. 276 (2010).  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion focused on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s substitution motion.  Holding that the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard should apply to that motion, the Ninth Circuit ruled that the District Court abused its discretion by failing to inquire into the complaints in Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second letter.  See id., at 278.  The Court of Appeals then considered how to remedy that error, given that Clair had received new counsel while on appeal.  It decided that \xe2\x80\x9cthe most reasonable solution\xe2\x80\x9d was to \xe2\x80\x9ctreat Clair\xe2\x80\x99s current counsel as if he were the counsel who might have been appointed\xe2\x80\x9d in June 2005, and to allow him to make whatever submissions he would have made then, including a motion to amend Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition in light of new evidence.

The question arises because the relevant statute, \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599, contains a notable gap.  Section 3599 first guarantees that indigent defendants in federal capital cases will receive the assistance of counsel, from pretrial proceedings through stay applications.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(a)(1), (a)(2), (e).  It next grants a corresponding right to people like Clair who seek federal habeas relief from a state death sentence, for all post-conviction proceedings and related activities.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(a)(2), (e); McFarland v. Scott, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 849\n\xe2\x80\x93855 (1994); Harbison v. Bell, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180\n\xe2\x80\x93185 (2009).  And the statute contemplates that both sets of litigants may sometimes substitute counsel; it notes that an attorney appointed under the section may be \xe2\x80\x9creplaced by similarly qualified counsel upon the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s own motion or upon motion of the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(e).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But here lies the rub: The statute fails to specify how a court should decide such a motion.  Section 3599 says not a word about the standard a court should apply when addressing a request for a new lawyer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties offer us two alternative ways to fill this statutory hole.  Clair argues, and the Ninth Circuit agreed, that district courts should decide substitution motions brought under \xc2\xa73599 \xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  That standard derives from \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A, which governs the appointment and substitution of counsel in federal non-capital litigation.  By contrast, the State contends that district courts may replace an appointed lawyer under \xc2\xa73599 only when the defendant has suffered an \xe2\x80\x9cactual or constructive denial\xe2\x80\x9d of counsel.  Brief for Petitioner 33.  That denial occurs, the State asserts, in just three situations: when the lawyer lacks the qualifications necessary for appointment under the statute; when he has a \xe2\x80\x9cdisabling conflict of interest\xe2\x80\x9d; or when he has \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely abandoned\xe2\x80\x9d the client.  Id., at 34.  On this matter, we think Clair, not the State, gets it right.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA trip back in time begins to show why.  Prior to 1988, \xc2\xa73006A governed the appointment of counsel in all federal criminal cases and habeas litigation, regardless whether the matter involved a capital or a non-capital offense.  That section provided counsel as a matter of right to most indigent criminal defendants, from pre-trial proceedings through appeal.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73006A(a)(1), (c) (1982 ed.).  In addition, the statute authorized courts to appoint counsel for federal habeas petitioners when \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of justice so require[d],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73006A(g); and under that provi-sion, courts almost always appointed counsel to represent petitioners convicted of capital offenses, see Ruthenbeck, Dueling with Death in Federal Courts, 4 ABA Criminal Justice, No. 3, pp.\xc2\xa02, 42 (Fall, 1989).  In all cases in which a court had appointed counsel, \xc2\xa73006A further provided (as it continues to do) that substitution motions should be decided \xe2\x80\x9cin the interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73006A(c).  So in those days, a court would have used that standard to evaluate a request like Clair\xe2\x80\x99s.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1988, Congress enacted the legislation now known as \xc2\xa73599 to govern appointment of counsel in capital cases, thus displacing \xc2\xa73006A for persons facing execution (but retaining that section for all others).  See Anti-Drug Abuse Act, \n\n102Stat.\n4393\xe2\x80\x934394, 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7848(q)(4)\xe2\x80\x93(10) (1988 ed.) (recodified at \n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73599 (2006 ed. and Supp. IV)).  The new statute grants federal capital defendants and capital habeas petitioners enhanced rights of representation, in light of what it calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe seriousness of the possible penalty and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the unique and complex nature of the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73599(d) (2006 ed.).  Habeas petitioners facing execution now receive counsel as a matter of right, not an exercise of the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.  See \xc2\xa73599(a)(2).  And the statute aims in multiple ways to improve the quality of representation afforded to capital petitioners and defendants alike.  Section 3599 requires lawyers in capital cases to have more legal experience than \xc2\xa73006A demands.  Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(b)\xe2\x80\x93(d) with \xc2\xa73006A(b).  Similarly, \xc2\xa73599 authorizes higher rates of compensation, in part to attract better counsel.  Compare \xc2\xa73599(g)(1) with \xc2\xa73006A(d) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).  And \xc2\xa73599 provides more money for investigative and expert services.  Compare \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73599(f) (2006 ed.), (g)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), with \xc2\xa73006A(e) (2006 ed. and Supp. IV).  As we have previously noted, those measures \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] a determination that quality legal representation is necessary\xe2\x80\x9d in all capital proceedings to foster \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental fairness in the imposition of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  McFarland, 512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 855, 859.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat understanding of \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s terms and origins goes far toward resolving the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute over what standard should apply.  We know that before \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s passage, courts used an \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard to decide substitution motions in all cases\xe2\x80\x94and that today, they continue to do so in all non-capital proceedings.  We know, too, that in spinning off \xc2\xa73599, Congress enacted a set of reforms to improve the quality of lawyering in capital litigation.    With all those measures pointing in one direction, we cannot conclude that Congress silently prescribed a substitution standard that would head the opposite way.  Adopting a more stringent test than \xc2\xa73006A\xe2\x80\x99s would deprive capital defendants of a tool they formerly had, and defendants facing lesser penalties still have, to handle serious representational problems.  That result clashes with everything else \xc2\xa73599 does.  By contrast, utilizing \xc2\xa73006A\xe2\x80\x99s standard comports with the myriad ways that \xc2\xa73599 seeks to promote effective representation for persons threatened with capital punishment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe dearth of support for the State\xe2\x80\x99s alternative standard reinforces the case for borrowing from \xc2\xa73006A.  Recall that the State thinks substitution proper \xe2\x80\x9conly when .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. counsel is completely denied\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, the State says, occurs when counsel lacks the requisite experience; \xe2\x80\x9cactively represents conflicting interests\xe2\x80\x9d; or has \xe2\x80\x9ctotal[ly] desert[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d the client.  Brief for Petitioner 15, 35, 38.  As the State acknowledges, this test comes from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. well, from nowhere.  The State conceded during argument that Congress has not considered (much less adopted) the standard in any context; neither has a federal court used it in any case.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 16.  Indeed, the standard is new to the State\xe2\x80\x99s own attorneys.  As noted earlier, when Clair first requested a change of counsel, the State responded that substitution is a \xe2\x80\x9cmatter .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of trial court discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29; see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Only later did the State devise its present proposal.  Inventiveness is often an admirable quality, but here we think the State overdoes it.  To be sure, we must infer a substitution standard for \xc2\xa73599; in that sense, we are writing on a blank slate.  But in undertaking that task, we prefer to copy something familiar than concoct something novel.  That enables courts to rely on experience and precedent, with a standard already known to work effectively.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill worse, the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposed test guts \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s pro-vision for substitution motions.  See \xc2\xa73599(e) (2006 ed.) (appointed counsel may be \xe2\x80\x9creplaced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. upon motion of the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to the State, a court may not change counsel under \xc2\xa73599 even if the attorney-client relationship has broken down, so long as the lawyer has the required qualifications and is \xe2\x80\x9cact[ing] as an advocate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 35.  And that is so, continues the State, even when substitution will not cause delay or other prejudice\xe2\x80\x94because again, the defendant retains a functioning lawyer.  See id., at 34.  That approach, as already noted, undermines Congress\xe2\x80\x99s efforts in \xc2\xa73599 to enhance representation in capital cases.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  And beyond that, it renders \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s substitution provision superfluous.  Even in the absence of that provision, a court would have to ensure that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s statutory right to counsel was satisfied throughout the litigation; for example, the court would have to appoint new counsel if the first lawyer developed a conflict with or abandoned the client.  So by confining substitution to cases in which the defendant has no counsel at all, the State\xe2\x80\x99s proposal effectively deletes \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s substitution clause.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State counters that only its approach comports with \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court\xe2\x80\x99s long-established jurisprudence that habeas prisoners, including capital prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d have no right to counsel under the \n \nSixth Amendment.  Brief for Petitioner 18; see Murray v. Giarratano, \n\n492 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n10, \n12 (1989)\n (plurality opinion); id., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); cf. Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722, \n755 (1991)\n (reserving question of whether the \n \nSixth Amendment guarantees counsel when a habeas proceeding provides the first opportunity to raise a claim).  But we do not understand the State\xe2\x80\x99s basis for linking use of the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard to cases in which an individual has a \n \nSixth Amendment right.  A statute need not draw the same lines as the Constitution, and neither \xc2\xa73006A nor \xc2\xa73599 does so in addressing the substitution of counsel.  Section 3006A applies the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard to substitution motions even when the \n \nSixth Amendment does not require representation; that is presumptively so, for example, when a court provides counsel to a non-capital habeas petitioner.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73006A(a)(2)(B), (c).  And whatever standard we adopt for \xc2\xa73599 will likewise apply both to litigants who have and to litigants who lack a \n \nSixth Amendment right, because the section offers counsel on the same terms to capital defendants and habeas petitioners.  In providing statutory rights to counsel, Congress declined to track the \n \nSixth Amendment; accordingly, the scope of that Amendment cannot answer the statutory question presented here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State\xe2\x80\x99s stronger argument relates to delay in capital proceedings.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard, the State contends, substitution motions will become a mechanism to defer enforcement of a death sentence, contrary to historic restrictions on \xe2\x80\x9cabuse of the writ\xe2\x80\x9d and to the goals of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  See Brief for Petitioner 19\xe2\x80\x9322.  But this argument, like the last, forgets that \xc2\xa73599 reaches not just habeas petitioners but also criminal defendants, who have not been convicted or sentenced and therefore have no incentive to delay.  Moreover, the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim misjudges the capacity of the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard to deal with such issues.  Protecting against abusive delay is an interest of justice.  Because that is so, courts addressing substitution motions in both capital and non-capital cases routinely consider issues of timeliness.  See, e.g., Hunter v. Delo, 62 F.\xc2\xa03d 271, 274 (CA8 1995) (citing \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to thwart abusive delay\xe2\x80\x9d in affirming the denial of a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s substitution motion); United States v. White, 451 F.\xc2\xa02d 1225, 1226 (CA6 1971) (per\xc2\xa0curiam) (approving a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to change counsel under \xc2\xa73006A(c) \xe2\x80\x9con the morning of the trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  Indeed, we will do so, just paragraphs from here, in this very case.  See infra, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316.  The standard we adopt thus takes account of, rather than ignores or opposes, the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding undue delay.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe remaining question is whether the District Court abused its discretion in denying Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second request for new counsel under \xc2\xa73599\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  We do not think the court did so, although the court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make any inquiry into Clair\xe2\x80\x99s allegations makes this decision harder than necessary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs its name betrays, the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard contemplates a peculiarly context-specific inquiry.  So we doubt that any attempt to provide a general definition of the standard would prove helpful.  In reviewing substitution motions, the courts of appeals have pointed to several relevant considerations.  Those factors may vary a bit from circuit to circuit, but generally include: the timeliness of the motion; the adequacy of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s complaint; and the asserted cause for that complaint, including the extent of the conflict or breakdown in communication between lawyer and client (and the client\xe2\x80\x99s own responsibility, if any, for that conflict).  See, e.g., United States v. Prime, 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 1147, 1154 (CA9 2005); United States v. Doe, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 116, 122\xe2\x80\x93123 (CA2 2001); Hunter, 62 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 274; United States v. Welty, 674 F.\xc2\xa02d 185, 188 (CA3 1982).  Because a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on substitution is so fact-specific, it deserves deference; a reviewing court may overturn it only for an abuse of discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court here received Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second substitution motion on the eve of deciding his 10-year-old habeas petition.  Recall that three months earlier, following an evidentiary hearing and post-hearing briefing, Clair had written the court to complain about his attorneys.  In that first letter, Clair accused his lawyers of refusing to co-operate with a private detective and, more generally, of forgoing efforts to prove his innocence.  After making proper inquiry, the court learned that Clair and his attorneys had worked through their dispute and Clair no longer wanted to substitute counsel.  The court thus turned its attention once again to ruling on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition\xe2\x80\x94only to receive another letter requesting a change in representation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf that second letter had merely recapitulated the charges in the first, this case would be relatively simple.  Even then, the court might have done well to make further inquiry of Clair and his counsel.  As all Circuits agree, courts cannot properly resolve substitution motions without probing why a defendant wants a new lawyer.  See, e.g., United States v. Iles, 906 F.\xc2\xa02d 1122, 1130 (CA6 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is hornbook law that \xe2\x80\x98[w]hen an indigent defendant makes a timely and good faith motion requesting that appointed counsel be discharged and new counsel appointed, the trial court clearly has a responsibility to determine the reasons for defendant\xe2\x80\x99s dissatisfaction . . .\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting 2 W. LaFave &amp; J. Israel, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa711.4, p. 36 (1984))).  Moreover, an on-the-record inquiry into the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s allegations \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[s] meaningful appellate review\xe2\x80\x9d of a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion.  United States v. Taylor, \n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326\n\xe2\x80\x93337 (1988).  But here the court had inquired, just a short time earlier, into Clair\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with his lawyers.  The court knew that Clair had responded to that inquiry by dropping his initial complaints.  And the court had reason to think, based on 10 years of handling the case, that those charges lacked merit: Perhaps most important, the court knew that the lawyers had raised many challenges not just to Clair\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, but to his conviction, including to the sufficiency of the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  See, e.g., App. to Pet. for Cert. 27\xe2\x80\x9369.  Especially at this stage of the litigation, those factors would have provided ample basis to reject a simple reprise of Clair\xe2\x80\x99s allegations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat complicates this case is that in his second letter, Clair added a new and significant charge of attorney error.  Beyond asserting generally that his lawyers were not trying to prove his innocence, Clair now alleged that counsel had refused to investigate particular, newly located physical evidence.  That evidence, according to Clair, might have shown that the police had suppressed Brady material, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in investigating the murder, or that he had not committed the offense.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 45\xe2\x80\x9346.  Especially in a case lacking physical evidence, built in part on since-recanted witness testimony, those possibilities cannot be blithely dismissed.  In the mine run of circumstances, Clair\xe2\x80\x99s new charge would have required the court to make further inquiry before ruling on his motion for a new attorney.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut here, the timing of that motion precludes a holding that the District Court abused its discretion.  The court received Clair\xe2\x80\x99s second letter while putting the finishing touches on its denial of his habeas petition.  (That lengthy decision issued just two weeks later.)  After many years of litigation, an evidentiary hearing, and substantial post-hearing briefing, the court had instructed the parties that it would accept no further submissions.  See App. 3\xe2\x80\x934; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4\xe2\x80\x935.  The case was all over but the deciding; counsel, whether old or new, could do nothing more in the trial court proceedings.  At that point and in that forum, Clair\xe2\x80\x99s conflict with his lawyers no longer mattered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tClair, to be sure, wanted to press his case further in the District Court.  He desired a new lawyer, after examining the physical evidence, to make whatever claims followed from it.  But, notably, all of those claims would have been new; as the District Court later found in ruling on Clair\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 60(b) motion, the physical evidence did not relate to any of the claims Clair had previously made in his habeas petition.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  A substitute lawyer thus would have had to seek an amendment of that petition, as well as an evidentiary hearing or, more likely, a stay to allow exhaustion of remedies in state court.  See 403 Fed. Appx., at 279.  The District Court could properly have rejected that motion, consistent with its order precluding further submissions (effectively remitting Clair to state court to pursue the matter).  See Mayle v. Felix, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 644, \n663 (2005)\n.  And if that is so, the court also acted within its discretion in denying Clair\xe2\x80\x99s request to substitute counsel, even without the usually appropriate inquiry.  The court was not required to appoint a new lawyer just so Clair could file a futile motion.  We accordingly find that the Court of Appeals erred in overturning the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment below is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0While litigating his Rule 60(b) motion in the District Court, Clair also pursued discovery in the California state courts relating to the newly found physical evidence.  On the basis of material he obtained, Clair filed another petition for state habeas relief, alleging (among other claims) actual innocence and improper suppression of exculpatory material under Brady v. Maryland, \n.  The California Supreme Court summarily denied that petition.

The State notes that the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard enables a court, when ruling on a substitution motion, to take account of a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness.  That consideration, according to the State, conflictswith AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s injunction that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ineffectiveness or incompetence of counsel during Federal or State collateral post-conviction proceedings shall not be a ground for relief in a [habeas] proceeding arising under section 2254.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n; see \xc2\xa72261(e) (using similar language).  But most naturally read, \xc2\xa72254(i) prohibits a court from granting substantive habeas relief on the basis of a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness in post-conviction proceedings, not from substituting counsel on that ground.  Cf. Holland v. Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 18) (holding that \xc2\xa72254(i) does not preclude equitable tolling of a statute of limitations based on attorney misconduct in habeas proceedings).  Indeed, if the State were right, we would also have to find that AEDPA silently repealed \xc2\xa73006A\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to courts to apply the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d standard in non-capital habeas cases.

The way to cure that error would have been to remand to the District Court to decide whether substitution was appropriate at the time of Clair\xe2\x80\x99s letter.  Unless that court determined that counsel should have been changed, the Court of Appeals had no basis for vacating the denial of Clair\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
