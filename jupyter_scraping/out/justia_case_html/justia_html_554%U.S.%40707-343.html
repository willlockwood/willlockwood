He was convicted and sentenced to death under a state statute authorizing capital punishment for the rape of a child under 12.  The State Supreme Court affirmed, rejecting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Coker</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/index.html">433 U. S. 584</a>, which barred the use of the death penalty as punishment for the rape of an adult woman but left open the question which, if any, other nonhomicide crimes can be punished by death consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Reasoning that children are a class in need of special protection, the state court held child rape to be unique in terms of the harm it inflicts upon the victim and society and concluded that, short of first-degree murder, there is no crime more deserving of death.  The court acknowledged that petitioner would be the first person executed since the state law was amended to authorize the death penalty for child rape in 1995, and that Louisiana is in the minority of jurisdictions authorizing death for that crime.  However, emphasizing that four more States had capitalized child rape since 1995 and at least eight others had authorized death for other nonhomicide crimes, as well as that, under <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, and <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, it is the direction of change rather than the numerical count that is significant, the court held petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence to be constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The Eighth Amendment bars Louisiana from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death.

S. 86</a>, 101.  The standard for extreme cruelty \xe2\x80\x9citself remains the same, but its applicability must change as the basic mores of society change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a>, 382.  Under the precept of justice that punishment is to be graduated and proportioned to the crime, informed by evolving standards, capital punishment must \xe2\x80\x9cbe limited to those offenders who commit \xe2\x80\x98a narrow category of the most serious crimes\xe2\x80\x99 and whose extreme culpability makes them \xe2\x80\x98the most deserving of execution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roper,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 568.  Applying this principle, the Court held in <em>Roper </em>and <em>Atkins </em>that the execution of juveniles and mentally retarded persons violates the Eighth Amendment because the offender has a diminished personal responsibility for the crime.  The Court also has found the death penalty disproportionate to the crime itself where the crime did not result, or was not intended to result, in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Coker, supra; Enmund</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a><em>.  </em>In making its determination, the Court is guided by \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice with respect to executions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 563.  Consensus is not dispositive, however.  Whether the death penalty is disproportionate to the crime also depends on the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, meaning, and purpose.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0A review of the authorities informed by contemporary norms, including the history of the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes and new enactments, and the number of executions since 1964, demonstrates a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court follows the approach of cases in which objective indicia of consensus demonstrated an opinion against the death penalty for juveniles, see <em>Roper, supra,</em> mentally retarded offenders, see <em>Atkins, supra,</em> and vicarious felony murderers, see <em>Enmund, supra.  </em>Thirty-seven jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9436 States plus the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94currently impose capital punishment, but only six States authorize it for child rape.  In 45 jurisdictions, by contrast, petitioner could not be executed for child rape of any kind.  That number surpasses the 30 States in <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Roper</em> and the 42 in <em>Enmund</em> that prohibited the death penalty under the circumstances those cases considered.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument that <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s general discussion contrasting murder and rape, 433 U. S., at 598, has been interpreted too expansively, leading some States to conclude that <em>Coker </em>applies to child rape when in fact it does not, is unsound.  <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was narrower than some of its language read in isolation indicates.  The <em>Coker</em> plurality framed the question as whether, \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to rape of an adult woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty is disproportionate punishment, <em>id., </em>at 592, and it repeated the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cadult woman\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cadult female\xe2\x80\x9d eight times in discussing the crime or the victim.  The distinction between adult and child rape was not merely rhetorical; it was central to <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, including its analysis of legislative consensus.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>id.,</em> at 595\xe2\x80\x93596.  There is little evidence to support respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that state legislatures have understood <em>Coker</em> to state a broad rule that covers minor victims, and state courts have uniformly concluded that <em>Coker</em> did not address that crime.  Accordingly, the small number of States that have enacted the death penalty for child rape is relevant to determining whether there is a consensus against capital punishment for the rape of a child.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9320. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0A consistent direction of change in support of the death penalty for child rape might counterbalance an otherwise weak demonstration of consensus, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Atkins, </em>536 U. S., at 315, but no showing of consistent change has been made here.  That five States may<em> </em>have had pending legislation authorizing death for child rape is not dispositive because it is not this Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice, nor is it sound, to find contemporary norms based on legislation proposed but not yet enacted.  Indeed, since the parties submitted their briefs, the legislation in at least two of the five States has failed.  Further, evidence that, in the last 13 years, six new death penalty statutes have been enacted, three in the last two years, is not as significant as the data in <em>Atkins</em>, where 18 States between 1986 and 2001 had enacted legislation prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons.  See <em>id.,</em> at 314\xe2\x80\x93315.  Respondent argues that this case is like <em>Roper</em> because, there, only five States had shifted their positions between 1989 and 2005, one less State than here.  See 543 U. S., at 565.  But the <em>Roper</em> Court emphasized that the slow pace of abolition was counterbalanced by the total number of States that had recognized the impropriety of executing juvenile offenders.  See <em>id., </em>at 566\xe2\x80\x93567.  Here, the fact that only six States have made child rape a capital offense is not an indication of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one in <em>Roper.  </em>The evidence bears a closer resemblance to that in <em>Enmund</em>, where the Court found a national consensus against death for vicarious felony murder despite eight jurisdictions having authorized it.  See<em> </em>458 U. S., at 789, 792.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9322. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Execution statistics also confirm that there is a social consensus against the death penalty for child rape.  Nine States have permitted capital punishment for adult or child rape for some length of time between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1972 <em>Furman</em> decision and today; yet no individual has been executed for the rape of an adult or child since 1964, and no execution for any other nonhomicide offense has been conducted since 1963.  Louisiana is the only State since 1964 that has sentenced an individual to death for child rape, and petitioner and another man so sentenced are the only individuals now on death row in the United States for nonhomicide offenses.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9323. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Informed by its own precedents and its understanding of the Constitution and the rights it secures, the Court concludes, in its independent judgment, that the death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the crime of child rape.  Pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9335.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s own judgment should be brought to bear on the death penalty\xe2\x80\x99s acceptability under the Eighth Amendment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Coker, supra</em>, at 597.  Rape\xe2\x80\x99s permanent and devastating impact on a child suggests moral grounds for questioning a rule barring capital punishment simply because the crime did not result in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death, but it does not follow that death is a proportionate penalty for child rape.  The constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments mandates that punishment \xe2\x80\x9cbe exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trop, </em>356 U. S., at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  Evolving standards of decency counsel the Court to be most hesitant before allowing extension of the death penalty, especially where no life was taken in the commission of the crime.  See, <em>e.g., Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 597\xe2\x80\x93598; <em>Enmund</em>, 458 U. S., at 797.  Consistent with those evolving standards and the teachings of its precedents, the Court concludes that there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individuals, even including child rape, on the other.  The latter crimes may be devastating in their harm, as here, but \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d they cannot compare to murder in their \xe2\x80\x9cseverity and irrevocability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id, </em>at 598.<em> </em>The Court finds significant the substantial number of executions that would be allowed for child rape under respondent\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  Although narrowing aggravators might be used to ensure the death penalty\xe2\x80\x99s restrained application in this context, as they are in the context of capital murder, all such standards have the potential to result in some inconsistency of application.  The Court, for example, has acknowledged that the requirement of general rules to ensure consistency of treatment, see, <em>e.g., Godfrey</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/index.html">446 U. S. 420</a>, and the insistence that capital sentencing be individualized, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html">428 U. S. 280</a>, have resulted in tension and imprecision.  This approach might be sound with respect to capital murder but it should not be introduced into the justice system where death has not occurred.  The Court has spent more than 32 years developing a foundational jurisprudence for capital murder to guide the States and juries in imposing the death penalty.  Beginning the same process for crimes for which no one has been executed in more than 40 years would require experimentation in an area where a failed experiment would result in the execution of individuals undeserving of death.  Pp.\xc2\xa024\xe2\x80\x9330. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is consistent with the justifications offered for the death penalty, retribution and deterrence, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>, 183.  Among the factors for determining whether retribution is served, the Court must look to whether the death penalty balances the wrong to the victim in nonhomicide cases.  Cf. <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 571.  It is not at all evident that the child rape victim\xe2\x80\x99s hurt is lessened when the law permits the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s death, given that capital cases require a long-term commitment by those testifying for the prosecution.  Society\xe2\x80\x99s desire to inflict death for child rape by enlisting the child victim to assist it over the course of years in asking for capital punishment forces a moral choice on the child, who is not of mature age to make that choice.  There are also relevant systemic concerns in prosecuting child rape, including the documented problem of unreliable, induced, and even imagined child testimony, which creates a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial risk of wrongful execution\xe2\x80\x9d in some cases.  Cf. <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 321.  As to deterrence, the evidence suggests that the death penalty may not result in more effective enforcement, but may add to the risk of nonreporting of child rape out of fear of negative consequences for the perpetrator, especially if he is a family member.  And, by in effect making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent, a State may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill his victim.  Pp.\xc2\xa030\xe2\x80\x9335. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xc2\xa0The concern that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will effectively block further development of a consensus favoring the death penalty for child rape overlooks the principle that the Eighth Amendment is defined by \xe2\x80\x9cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Trop, </em>356 U. S., at 101.  Confirmed by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated, consistent rulings, this principle requires that resort to capital punishment be restrained, limited in its instances of application, and reserved for the worst of crimes, those that, in the case of crimes against individuals, take the victim\xe2\x80\x99s life.

See Amdts. 8 and 14, \xc2\xa71; <em>Robinson</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/660/index.html">370 U. S. 660</a> (1962).  Patrick Kennedy, the petitioner here, seeks to set aside his death sentence under the Eighth Amendment.  He was charged by the respondent, the State of Louisiana, with the aggravated rape of his then-8-year-old stepdaughter.  After a jury trial petitioner was convicted and sentenced to death under a state statute authorizing capital punishment for the rape of a child under 12 years of age.  See La. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:42 (West 1997 and Supp. 1998).  This case presents the question whether the Constitution bars respondent from imposing the death penalty for the rape of a child where the crime did not result, and was not intended to result, in death of the victim.  We hold the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for this offense.  The Louisiana statute is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s crime was one that cannot be recounted in these pages in a way sufficient to capture in full the hurt and horror inflicted on his victim or to convey the revulsion society, and the jury that represents it, sought to express by sentencing petitioner to death.  At 9:18 a.m. on March 2, 1998, petitioner called 911 to report that his stepdaughter, referred to here as L.\xc2\xa0H., had been raped.  He told the 911 operator that L. H. had been in the garage while he readied his son for school.  Upon hearing loud screaming, petitioner said, he ran outside and found L. H. in the side yard.  Two neighborhood boys, petitioner told the operator, had dragged L.\xc2\xa0H. from the garage to the yard, pushed her down, and raped her.  Petitioner claimed he saw one of the boys riding away on a blue 10-speed bicycle.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When police arrived at petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s home between 9:20 and 9:30 a.m., they found L.\xc2\xa0H. on her bed, wearing a\nT-shirt and wrapped in a bloody blanket.  She was bleeding profusely from the vaginal area.  Petitioner told police he had carried her from the yard to the bathtub and then to the bed.  Consistent with this explanation, police found a thin line of blood drops in the garage on the way to the house and then up the stairs.  Once in the bedroom, petitioner had used a basin of water and a cloth to wipe blood from the victim.  This later prevented medical personnel from collecting a reliable DNA sample.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0H. was transported to the Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hospital.  An expert in pediatric forensic medicine testified that L.\xc2\xa0H.\xe2\x80\x99s injuries were the most severe he had seen from a sexual assault in his four years of practice.  A laceration to the left wall of the vagina had separated her cervix from the back of her vagina, causing her rectum to protrude into the vaginal structure.  Her entire perineum was torn from the posterior fourchette to the anus.  The injuries required emergency surgery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the scene of the crime, at the hospital, and in the first weeks that followed, both L.\xc2\xa0H. and petitioner maintained in their accounts to investigators that L.\xc2\xa0H. had been raped by two neighborhood boys.  One of L.\xc2\xa0H.\xe2\x80\x99s doctors testified at trial that L. H. told all hospital personnel the same version of the rape, although she reportedly told one family member that petitioner raped her.  L.\xc2\xa0H. was interviewed several days after the rape by a psychologist.  The interview was videotaped, lasted three hours over two days, and was introduced into evidence at trial.  On the tape one can see that L.\xc2\xa0H. had difficulty discussing the subject of the rape.  She spoke haltingly and with long pauses and frequent movement.  Early in the interview, L.\xc2\xa0H. expressed reservations about the questions being asked:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m going to tell the same story.  They just want me to change it\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. They want me to say my Dad did it\xe2\x80\xa6 .  I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to say it\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

The State\xe2\x80\x99s investigation had drawn the accuracy of petitioner and L.\xc2\xa0H.\xe2\x80\x99s story into question.  Though the defense at trial proffered alternative explanations, the case for the prosecution, credited by the jury, was based upon the following evidence: An inspection of the side yard immediately after the assault was inconsistent with a rape having occurred there, the grass having been found mostly undisturbed but for a small patch of coagulated blood.  Petitioner said that one of the perpetrators fled the crime scene on a blue 10-speed bicycle but gave inconsistent descriptions of the bicycle\xe2\x80\x99s features, such as its handlebars.  Investigators found a bicycle matching petitioner and L.\xc2\xa0H.\xe2\x80\x99s description in tall grass behind a nearby apartment, and petitioner identified it as the bicycle one of the perpetrators was riding.  Yet its tires were flat, it did not have gears, and it was covered in spider webs.  In addition police found blood on the underside of L.\xc2\xa0H.\xe2\x80\x99s mattress.  This convinced them the rape took place in her bedroom, not outside the house.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Police also found that petitioner made two telephone calls on the morning of the rape.  Sometime before 6:15 a.m., petitioner called his employer and left a message that he was unavailable to work that day.  Petitioner called back between 6:30 and 7:30 a.m. to ask a colleague how to get blood out of a white carpet because his daughter had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98just become a young lady.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 12.  At 7:37 a.m., petitioner called B &amp; B Carpet Cleaning and requested urgent assistance in removing bloodstains from a carpet.  Petitioner did not call 911 until about an hour and a half later.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About a month after petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arrest L.\xc2\xa0H. was removed from the custody of her mother, who had maintained until that point that petitioner was not involved in the rape.  On June 22, 1998, L.\xc2\xa0H. was returned home and told her mother for the first time that petitioner had raped her.

L.\xc2\xa0H. acknowledged that she had accused two neighborhood boys but testified petitioner told her to say this and that it was untrue.  <em>Id.,</em> at 769.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury having found petitioner guilty of aggravated rape, the penalty phase ensued.  The State presented the testimony of S.\xc2\xa0L., who is the cousin and goddaughter of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife.  S.\xc2\xa0L. testified that petitioner sexually abused her three times when she was eight years old and that the last time involved sexual intercourse.  <em>Id.,</em> at 772.  She did not tell anyone until two years later and did not pursue legal action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury unanimously determined that petitioner should be sentenced to death.  The Supreme Court of Louisiana affirmed.  See <em>id., </em>at 779\xe2\x80\x93789, 793; see also <em>State</em> v. <em>Wilson</em>, 96\xe2\x80\x931392, 96\xe2\x80\x932076 (La. 12/13/96), 685 So.\xc2\xa02d 1063 (upholding the constitutionality of the death penalty for child rape).  The court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Coker</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/index.html"></a><a href="/us/433/584/index.html">433 U. S. 584</a> (1977), noting that, while <em>Coker </em>bars the use of the death penalty as punishment for the rape of an adult woman, it left open the question which, if any, other nonhomicide crimes can be punished by death consistent with the Eighth Amendment.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98children are a class that need special protection,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the state court reasoned, the rape of a child is unique in terms of the harm it inflicts upon the victim and our society.  957 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 781.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court acknowledged that petitioner would be the first person executed for committing child rape since La. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:42 was amended in 1995 and that Louisiana is in the minority of jurisdictions that authorize the death penalty for the crime of child rape.  But following the approach of <em>Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a> (2005), and <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a> (2002), it found significant not the \xe2\x80\x9cnumerical counting of which [S]tates \xe2\x80\xa6 stand for or against a particular capital prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cthe direction of change.\xe2\x80\x9d  957 So. 2d, at 783 (emphasis deleted).  Since 1993, the court explained, four more States\xe2\x80\x94Oklahoma, South Carolina, Montana, and Georgia\xe2\x80\x94had capitalized the crime of child rape and at least eight States had authorized capital punishment for other nonhomicide crimes.  By its count, 14 of the then-38 States permitting capital punishment, plus the Federal Government, allowed the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes and 5 allowed the death penalty for the crime of child rape.  See <em>id.,</em> at 785\xe2\x80\x93786.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state court next asked whether \xe2\x80\x9cchild rapists rank among the worst offenders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 788.  It noted the severity of the crime; that the execution of child rapists would serve the goals of deterrence and retribution; and that, unlike in <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Roper</em>, there were no characteristics of petitioner that tended to mitigate his moral culpability.  <em>Id.,</em> at 788\xe2\x80\x93789.  It concluded: \xe2\x80\x9c[S]hort of first-degree murder, we can think of no other non-homicide crime more deserving [of capital punishment].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 789<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On this reasoning the Supreme Court of Louisiana rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the death penalty for the rape of a child under 12 years is disproportionate and upheld the constitutionality of the statute.  Chief Justice Calogero dissented.  <em>Coker</em>, <em>supra,</em> and <em>Eberheart</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/917/index.html">433 U. S. 917</a> (1977), in his view, \xe2\x80\x9cset out a bright-line and easily administered rule\xe2\x80\x9d that the Eighth Amendment precludes capital punishment for any offense that does not involve the death of the victim.  957 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 794.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  See 552 U. S. ___ (2008).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eighth Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth Amendment, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Amendment proscribes \xe2\x80\x9call excessive punishments, as well as cruel and unusual punishments that may or may not be excessive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 311, n.\xc2\xa07.  The Court explained in <em>Atkins</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 311, and <em>Roper, supra</em>, at 560, that the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments flows from the basic \xe2\x80\x9cprecept of justice that punishment for [a] crime should be graduated and proportioned to [the] offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weems</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/217/349/index.html">217 U. S. 349</a>, 367 (1910).  Whether this requirement has been fulfilled is determined not by the standards that prevailed when the Eighth Amendment was adopted in 1791 but by the norms that \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 311.  The Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cdraw[s] its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trop</em> v. <em>Dulles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/356/86/index.html">356 U. S. 86</a>, 101 (1958) (plurality opinion).  This is because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he standard of extreme cruelty is not merely descriptive, but necessarily embodies a moral judgment.  The standard itself remains the same, but its applicability must change as the basic mores of society change.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Furman</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/238/index.html"></a><a href="/us/408/238/index.html">408 U. S. 238</a>, 382 (1972) (Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evolving standards of decency must embrace and express respect for the dignity of the person, and the punishment of criminals must conform to that rule.  See <em>Trop, supra,</em> at 100 (plurality opinion).  As we shall discuss, punishment is justified under one or more of three principal rationales: rehabilitation, deterrence, and retribution.  See <em>Harmelin</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/957/index.html">501 U. S. 957</a>, 999 (1991) (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Part IV\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.  It is the last of these, retribution, that most often can contradict the law\xe2\x80\x99s own ends.  This is of particular concern when the Court interprets the meaning of the Eighth Amendment in capital cases.  When the law punishes by death, it risks its own sudden descent into brutality, transgressing the constitutional commitment to decency and restraint.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons we have explained that capital punishment must \xe2\x80\x9cbe limited to those offenders who commit \xe2\x80\x98a narrow category of the most serious crimes\xe2\x80\x99 and whose extreme culpability makes them \xe2\x80\x98the most deserving of execution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 568 (quoting <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319).  Though the death penalty is not invariably unconstitutional, see <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a> (1976), the Court insists upon confining the instances in which the punishment can be imposed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this principle, we held in <em>Roper </em>and <em>Atkins </em>that the execution of juveniles and mentally retarded persons are punishments violative of the Eighth Amendment because the offender had a diminished personal responsibility for the crime.  See <em>Roper, supra,</em> at 571\xe2\x80\x93573; <em>Atkins, supra</em>, at 318, 320.  The Court further has held that the death penalty can be disproportionate to the crime itself where the crime did not result, or was not intended to result, in death of the victim.  In <em>Coker,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/index.html"></a><a href="/us/433/584/index.html">433 U. S. 584</a>, for instance, the Court held it would be unconstitutional to execute an offender who had raped an adult woman.  See also <em>Eberheart, supra </em>(holding unconstitutional in light of <em>Coker</em> a sentence of death for the kidnaping and rape of an adult woman).  And in <em>Enmund</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a> (1982), the Court overturned the capital sentence of a defendant who aided and abetted a robbery during which a murder was committed but did not himself kill, attempt to kill, or intend that a killing would take place.  On the other hand, in <em>Tison</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/137/index.html">481 U. S. 137</a> (1987), the Court allowed the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 death\nsentences to stand where they did not themselves kill\nthe victims but their involvement in the events leading\nup to the murders was active, recklessly indifferent, and substantial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these cases the Court has been guided by \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia of society\xe2\x80\x99s standards, as expressed in legislative enactments and state practice with respect to executions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 563; see also <em>Coker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 593\xe2\x80\x93597 (plurality opinion) (finding that both legislatures and juries had firmly rejected the penalty of death for the rape of an adult woman); <em>Enmund</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 788 (looking to \xe2\x80\x9chistorical development of the punishment at issue, legislative judgments, international opinion, and the sentencing decisions juries have made\xe2\x80\x9d).  The inquiry does not end there, however.  Consensus is not dispositive.  Whether the death penalty is disproportionate to the crime committed depends as well upon the standards elaborated by controlling precedents and by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own understanding and interpretation of the Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, history, meaning, and purpose.  See <em>id., </em>at 797\xe2\x80\x93801; <em>Gregg</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 182\xe2\x80\x93183 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.); <em>Coker</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 597\xe2\x80\x93600 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based both on consensus and our own independent judgment, our holding is that a death sentence for one who raped but did not kill a child, and who did not intend to assist another in killing the child, is unconstitutional under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The existence of objective indicia of consensus against making a crime punishable by death was a relevant concern in <em>Roper</em>, <em>Atkins</em>, <em>Coker</em>, and <em>Enmund</em>, and we follow the approach of those cases here.  The history of the death penalty for the crime of rape is an instructive beginning point.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1925, 18 States, the District of Columbia, and the Federal Government had statutes that authorized the death penalty for the rape of a child or an adult.  See <em>Coker, supra,</em> at 593 (plurality opinion).  Between 1930 and 1964, 455 people were executed for those crimes.  See 5 Historical Statistics of the United States: Earliest Times to the Present, pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x93262 to 5\xe2\x80\x93263 (S. Carter et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>eds. 2006) (Table Ec343\xe2\x80\x93357).  To our knowledge the last individual executed for the rape of a child was Ronald Wolfe in 1964.  See H. Frazier, Death Sentences in Missouri, 1803\xe2\x80\x932005: A History and Comprehensive Registry of Legal Executions, Pardons, and Commutations 143 (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1972, <em>Furman</em> invalidated most of the state statutes authorizing the death penalty for the crime of rape; and in <em>Furman</em>\xe2\x80\x99s aftermath only six States reenacted their capital rape provisions.  Three States\xe2\x80\x94Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana\xe2\x80\x94did so with respect to all rape offenses.  Three States\xe2\x80\x94Florida, Mississippi, and Tennessee\xe2\x80\x94did so with respect only to child rape.  See <em>Coker, supra,</em> at 594\xe2\x80\x93595 (plurality opinion).  All six statutes were later invalidated under state or federal law.  See <em>Coker</em>, <em>supra </em>(striking down Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s capital rape statute); <em>Woodson</em> v. <em>North Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/280/index.html">428 U. S. 280</a>, 287, n.\xc2\xa06, 301\xe2\x80\x93305 (1976) (plurality opinion) (striking down North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory death penalty statute); <em>Roberts</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/325/index.html">428 U.

See La. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:42 (West Supp. 1996).  Under the current statute, any anal, vaginal, or oral intercourse with a child under the age of 13 constitutes aggravated rape and is punishable by death.  See La. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa714:42 (West Supp. 2007).  Mistake of age is not a defense, so the statute imposes strict liability in this regard.  Five States have since followed Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s lead:  Georgia, see Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x931 (2007) (enacted 1999); Montana, see Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa745\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93503 (2007) (enacted 1997); Oklahoma, see Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, \xc2\xa77115(K) (West 2007 Supp.) (enacted 2006); South Carolina, see S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x93655(C)(1) (Supp. 2007) (enacted 2006); and Texas, see Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa712.42(c)(3) (West Supp. 2007) (enacted 2007); see also Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa722.021(a) (West Supp. 2007).  Four of these States\xe2\x80\x99 statutes are more narrow than Louisiana\xe2\x80\x99s in that only offenders with a previous rape conviction are death eligible.  See Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa745\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93503(3)(c); Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, \xc2\xa77115(K); S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x93655(C)(1); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa712.42(c)(3).  Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s statute makes child rape a capital offense only when aggravating circumstances are present, including but not limited to a prior conviction.  See Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa717\xe2\x80\x9310\xe2\x80\x9330 (Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, 44 States have not made child rape a capital offense.  As for federal law, Congress in the Federal Death Penalty Act of 1994 expanded the number of federal crimes for which the death penalty is a permissible sentence, including certain nonhomicide offenses; but it did not do the same for child rape or abuse.  See 108 Stat. 1972 (codified as amended in scattered sections of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.).  Under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72245, an offender is death eligible only when the sexual abuse or exploitation results in the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner claims the death penalty for child rape is not authorized in Georgia, pointing to a 1979 decision in which the Supreme Court of Georgia stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tatutory rape is not a capital crime in Georgia.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Presnell</em> v. <em>State</em>, 243 Ga. 131, 132\xe2\x80\x93133, 252 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 625, 626.  But it appears <em>Presnell</em> was referring to the separate crime of statutory rape, which is not a capital offense in Georgia, see Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa726\xe2\x80\x932018 (1969); cf. Ga. Code. Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x933 (2007).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s current capital rape statute, by contrast, is explicit that the rape of \xe2\x80\x9c[a] female who is less than ten years of age\xe2\x80\x9d is punishable \xe2\x80\x9cby death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x931(a)(2), (b) (2007).  Based on a recent statement by the Supreme Court of Georgia it must be assumed that this law is still in force: \xe2\x80\x9cNeither the United States Supreme Court, nor this Court, has yet addressed whether the death penalty is unconstitutionally disproportionate for the crime of raping a child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Velazquez</em>, 283 Ga. 206, 208, 657 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 838, 840 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent would include Florida among those States that permit the death penalty for child rape.  The state statute does authorize, by its terms, the death penalty for \xe2\x80\x9csexual battery upon \xe2\x80\xa6 a person less than 12 years of age.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7794.011(2) (2007); see also \xc2\xa7921.141(5) (2007).  In 1981, however, the Supreme Court of Florida held the death penalty for child sexual assault to be unconstitutional.  See <em>Buford, supra</em>.  It acknowledged that <em>Coker</em> addressed only the constitutionality of the death penalty for rape of an adult woman, 403 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 950, but held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he reasoning of the justices in <em>Coker</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 compels [the conclusion] that a sentence of death is grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment for the crime of sexual assault and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 951.  Respondent points out that the state statute has not since been amended.  Pursuant to Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7775.082(2) (2007), however, Florida state courts have understood <em>Buford</em> to bind their sentencing discretion in child rape cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Gibson</em> v. <em>State</em>, 721 So.\xc2\xa02d 363, 367, and n. 2 (Fla. App. 1998) (deeming it irrelevant that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Florida Legislature never changed the wording of the sexual battery statute\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>State</em>, 453 So.\xc2\xa02d 67 (Fla. App. 1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cAfter <em>Buford</em>, death was no longer a possible penalty in Florida for sexual battery\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7775.082(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the event the death penalty in a capital felony is held to be unconstitutional by the Florida Supreme Court \xe2\x80\xa6 the court having jurisdiction over a person previously sentenced to death for a capital felony \xe2\x80\xa6 shall sentence such person to life imprisonment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Definitive resolution of state-law issues is for the States\xe2\x80\x99 own courts, and there may be disagreement over the statistics.  It is further true that some States, including States that have addressed the issue in just the last few years, have made child rape a capital offense.  The summary recited here, however, does allow us to make certain comparisons with the data cited in the <em>Atkins</em>, <em>Roper, </em>and <em>Enmund</em> cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When <em>Atkins</em> was decided in 2002, 30 States, including 12 noncapital jurisdictions, prohibited the death penalty for mentally retarded offenders; 20 permitted it.  See 536 U. S., at 313\xe2\x80\x93315.  When <em>Roper</em> was decided in 2005, the numbers disclosed a similar division among the States: 30 States prohibited the death penalty for juveniles, 18 of which permitted the death penalty for other offenders; and 20 States authorized it.  See 543 U. S., at 564.  Both in <em>Atkins</em> and in <em>Roper</em>, we noted that the practice of executing mentally retarded and juvenile offenders was infrequent.  Only five States had executed an offender known to have an IQ below 70 between 1989 and 2002, see <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 316; and only three States had executed a juvenile offender between 1995 and 2005, see <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 564\xe2\x80\x93565.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statistics in <em>Enmund</em> bear an even greater similarity to the instant case.  There eight jurisdictions had authorized imposition of the death penalty solely for participation in a robbery during which an accomplice committed murder, see 458 U. S., at 789, and six defendants between 1954 and 1982 had been sentenced to death for felony murder where the defendant did not personally commit the homicidal assault, <em>id.,</em> at 794.  These facts, the Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cweigh[ed] on the side of rejecting capital punishment for the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 793.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The evidence of a national consensus with respect to the death penalty for child rapists, as with respect to juveniles, mentally retarded offenders, and vicarious felony murderers, shows divided opinion but, on balance, an opinion against it.  Thirty-seven jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9436 States plus the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x94have the death penalty.  As mentioned above, only six of those jurisdictions authorize the death penalty for rape of a child.  Though our review of national consensus is not confined to tallying the number of States with applicable death penalty legislation, it is of significance that, in 45 jurisdictions, petitioner could not be executed for child rape of any kind.  That number surpasses the 30 States in <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Roper</em> and the 42 States in <em>Enmund</em> that prohibited the death penalty under the circumstances those cases considered.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least one difference between this case and our Eighth Amendment proportionality precedents must be addressed.  Respondent and its <em>amici</em> suggest that some States have an \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous understanding of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Missouri Governor Matt Blunt et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 10.  They submit that the general propositions set out in <em>Coker, </em>contrasting murder and rape, have been interpreted in too expansive a way, leading some state legislatures to conclude that <em>Coker </em>applies to child rape when in fact its reasoning does not, or ought not, apply to that specific crime.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument seems logical at first, but in the end it is unsound.  In <em>Coker, </em>a four-Member plurality of the Court, plus Justice Brennan and Justice Marshall in concurrence, held that a sentence of death for the rape of a 16-year-old woman, who was a minor under Georgia law, see Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa774\xe2\x80\x93104 (1973), yet was characterized by the Court as an adult, was disproportionate and excessive under the Eighth Amendment.  See 433 U. S., at 593\xe2\x80\x93600; see also <em>id.,</em> at 600 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment); <em>ibid.</em> (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  (The Court did not explain why the 16-year-old victim qualified as an adult, but it may be of some significance that she was married, had a home of her own, and had given birth to a son three weeks prior to the rape.  See Brief for Petitioner in <em>Coker</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1976, No. 75\xe2\x80\x935444, pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plurality noted that only one State had a valid statute authorizing the death penalty for adult rape and that \xe2\x80\x9cin the vast majority of cases, at least 9 out of 10, juries ha[d] not imposed the death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coker</em>,<em> </em>433 U. S.,<em> </em>at 597; see also <em>id.,</em> at 594 (\xe2\x80\x9cOf the 16 States in which rape had been a capital offense, only three provided the death penalty for rape of an adult woman in their revised statutes\xe2\x80\x94Georgia, North Carolina, and Louisiana.  In the latter two States, the death penalty was mandatory for those found guilty, and those laws were invalidated by <em>Woodson </em>and <em>Roberts</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  This \xe2\x80\x9chistory and \xe2\x80\xa6 objective evidence of the country\xe2\x80\x99s present judgment concerning the acceptability of death as a penalty for rape of an adult woman,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 593, confirmed the Court\xe2\x80\x99s independent judgment that punishing adult rape by death was not proportional:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cRape is without doubt deserving of serious punishment; but in terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public, it does not compare with murder, which does involve the unjustified taking of human life.  Although it may be accompanied by another crime, rape by definition does not include the death of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0another person.  The murderer kills; the rapist, if no more than that, does not\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0We have the abiding conviction that the death penalty, which \xe2\x80\x98is unique in its severity and irrevocability,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Gregg  </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, 428 U. S., at 187, is an excessive penalty for the rapist who, as such, does not take human life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 598 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Confined to this passage, <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the Eighth Amendment is susceptible of a reading that would prohibit making child rape a capital offense.  In context, however, <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding was narrower than some of its language read in isolation.  The <em>Coker</em> plurality framed the question as whether, \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to rape of an adult woman,\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty is disproportionate punishment.  <em>Id., </em>at 592.  And it repeated the phrase \xe2\x80\x9can adult woman\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9can adult female\xe2\x80\x9d in discussing the act of rape or the victim of rape eight times in its opinion.  See <em>Coker, supra</em>.  The distinction between adult and child rape was not merely rhetorical; it was central to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.  The opinion does not speak to the constitutionality of the death penalty for child rape, an issue not then before the Court.  In discussing the legislative background, for example, the Court noted:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFlorida, Mississippi, and Tennessee also authorized the death penalty in some rape cases, but only where the victim was a child and the rapist an adult.  The Tennessee statute has since been invalidated because the death sentence was mandatory.  The upshot is that Georgia is the sole jurisdiction in the United States at the present time that authorizes a sentence of death when the rape victim is an adult woman, and only two other jurisdictions provide capital punishment when the victim is a child\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0[This] obviously weighs very heavily on the side of rejecting capi-\ntal punishment as a suitable penalty for raping an adult woman.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Id</em>., at 595\xe2\x80\x93596 (citation and footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, respondent contends, it is possible that state legislatures have understood <em>Coker </em>to state a broad rule that covers the situation of the minor victim as well.  We see little evidence of this.  Respondent cites no reliable data to indicate that state legislatures have read <em>Coker</em> to bar capital punishment for child rape<em> </em>and, for this reason, have been deterred from passing applicable death penalty legislation.  In the absence of evidence from those States where legislation has been proposed but not enacted we refuse to speculate about the motivations and concerns of particular state legislators.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The position of the state courts, furthermore, to which state legislators look for guidance on these matters, indicates that <em>Coker </em>has not blocked the emergence of legislative consensus.  The state courts that have confronted the precise question before us have been uniform in concluding that <em>Coker</em> did not address the constitutionality of the death penalty for the crime of child rape.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wilson</em>, 685 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1066 (upholding the constitutionality of the death penalty for rape of a child and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he plurality [in <em>Coker</em>] took great pains in referring only to the rape of adult women<em> </em>throughout their opinion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis deleted)); <em>Upshaw</em> v. <em>State</em>, 350 So.\xc2\xa02d 1358, 1360 (Miss. 1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn <em>Coker</em> the Court took great pains to limit its decision to the applicability of the death penalty for the rape of an adult woman\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  As we view <em>Coker</em> the Court carefully refrained from deciding whether the death penalty for the rape of a female child under the age of twelve years is grossly disproportionate to the crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Simpson</em> v. <em>Owens</em>, 207 Ariz. 261, 268, n.\xc2\xa08, 85 P.\xc2\xa03d 478, 485, n.\xc2\xa08 (App. 2004) (addressing the denial of bail for sexual offenses against children and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough the death penalty was declared in a plurality opinion of the United States Supreme Court to be a disproportionate punishment for the rape of an adult woman \xe2\x80\xa6 the rape of a child remains a capital offense in some states\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> People</em> v. <em>Hernandez</em>, 30 Cal. 4th 835, 869, 69 P.\xc2\xa03d 446, 466 (2003) (addressing the death penalty for conspiracy to commit murder and noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutionality of laws imposing the death penalty for crimes not necessarily resulting in death is unresolved\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, to be sure, some contrary authority contained in various state-court opinions.  But it is either dicta, see <em>State </em>v.<em> Barnum</em>, 921 So.\xc2\xa02d 513, 526 (Fla. 2005) (addressing the retroactivity of <em>Thompson</em> v. <em>State</em>, 695 So.\xc2\xa02d 691 (Fla. 1997)); <em>State </em>v.<em> Coleman</em>, 185 Mont. 299, 327, 605 P.\xc2\xa02d 1000, 1017 (1979) (upholding the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s death sentence for aggravated kidnaping); <em>State </em>v.<em> Gardner</em>, 947 P.\xc2\xa02d 630, 653 (Utah 1997) (addressing the constitutionality of the death penalty for prison assaults); equivocal in its conclusion, see <em>People </em>v.<em> Huddleston</em>, 212 Ill. 2d 107, 141, 816 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 322, 341\xe2\x80\x93342 (2004) (citing law review articles for the proposition that the constitutionality of the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes \xe2\x80\x9cis the subject of debate\xe2\x80\x9d); or from a decision of a state intermediate court that has been superseded by a more specific statement of the law by the State\xe2\x80\x99s supreme court, compare, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Parker </em>v.<em> State</em>, 216 Ga.

But even there the state court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [Supreme] Court has yet to decide whether [<em>Coker\xe2\x80\x99</em>s rationale] holds true for the rape of a child\xe2\x80\x9d and made explicit that it was extending the reasoning but not the holding of <em>Coker</em> in striking down the death penalty for child rape.  403 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 950, 951.  The same is true of the Supreme Court of California\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Hernandez</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 867, 69 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 464.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude on the basis of this review that there is no clear indication that state legislatures have misinterpreted <em>Coker </em>to hold that the death penalty for child rape is unconstitutional.  The small number of States that have enacted this penalty, then, is relevant to determining whether there is a consensus against capital punishment for this crime.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent insists that the six States where child rape is a capital offense, along with the States that have proposed but not yet enacted applicable death penalty legislation, reflect a consistent direction of change in support of the death penalty for child rape.  Consistent change might counterbalance an otherwise weak demonstration of consensus.  See <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 315 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not so much the number of these States that is significant, but the consistency of the direction of change\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 565 (\xe2\x80\x9cImpressive in <em>Atkins </em>was the rate of abolition of the death penalty for the mentally retarded\xe2\x80\x9d).  But whatever the significance of consistent change where it is cited to show emerging support for expanding the scope of the death penalty, no showing of consistent change has been made in this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and its <em>amici </em>identify five States where, in their view, legislation authorizing capital punishment for child rape is pending.  See Brief for Missouri Governor Matt Blunt et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>as <em>Amici Curiae </em>2, 14.  It is not our practice, nor is it sound, to find contemporary norms based upon state legislation that has been proposed but not yet enacted.  There are compelling reasons not to do so here.  Since the briefs were submitted by the parties, legislation in two of the five States has failed.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> S.\xc2\xa0195, 66th Gen. Assembly, 2d Reg. Sess. (Colo. 2008) (rejected by Senate Appropriations Committee on Apr. 11, 2008); S.\xc2\xa02596, 2008 Leg., Reg. Sess. (Miss. 2008) (rejected by House Committee on Mar. 18, 2008).  In Tennessee, the house bills were rejected almost a year ago, and the senate bills appear to have died in committee.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. 601, 105th Gen. Assembly, 1st Reg. Sess. (2007) (taken off Subcommittee Calendar on Apr. 4, 2007); H.\xc2\xa0R. 662, <em>ibid.</em> (failed for lack of second on Mar. 21, 2007); H.\xc2\xa0R. 1099, <em>ibid. </em>(taken off notice for Judiciary Committee calendar on May 16, 2007); S.\xc2\xa022, <em>ibid.</em> (referred to General Subcommittee of Senate Finance, Ways, and Means Committee on June 11, 2007); S.\xc2\xa0157, <em>ibid.</em> (referred to Senate Judiciary Committee on Feb. 7, 2007; action deferred until Jan. 2008); S.\xc2\xa0841, <em>ibid.</em> (referred to General Subcommittee of Senate Judiciary Committee on Mar. 27, 2007).  In Alabama, the recent legislation is similar to a bill that failed in 2007.  Compare H.\xc2\xa0R. 456, 2008 Leg., Reg. Sess. (2008), with H.\xc2\xa0R. 335, 2007 Leg., Reg. Sess. (2007).  And in Missouri, the 2008 legislative session has ended, tabling the pending legislation.  See Mo. Const., Art. III, \xc2\xa720(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aside from pending legislation, it is true that in the last 13 years there has been change towards making child rape a capital offense.  This is evidenced by six new death penalty statutes, three enacted in the last two years.  But this showing is not as significant as the data in <em>Atkins</em>, where 18 States between 1986 and 2001 had enacted legislation prohibiting the execution of mentally retarded persons.  See <em>Atkins, supra, </em>at 313\xe2\x80\x93315.  Respondent argues the instant case is like <em>Roper</em> because, there, only five States had shifted their positions between 1989 and 2005, one less State than here.  See <em>Roper, supra, </em>at 565.  But in <em>Roper</em>, we emphasized that, though the pace of abolition was not as great as in <em>Atkins</em>, it was counterbalanced by the total number of States that had recognized the impropriety of executing juvenile offenders.  See 543 U. S., at 566\xe2\x80\x93567.  When we decided <em>Stanford</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/361/index.html">492 U. S. 361</a> (1989), 12 death penalty States already prohibited the execution of any juvenile under 18, and 15 prohibited the execution of any juvenile under 17.  See <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 566\xe2\x80\x93567 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf anything, this shows that the impropriety of executing juveniles between 16 and 18 years of age gained wide recognition earlier\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, the total number of States to have made child rape a capital offense after <em>Furman </em>is six.  This is not an indication of a trend or change in direction comparable to the one supported by data in <em>Roper.  </em>The evidence here bears a closer resemblance to the evidence of state activity in <em>Enmund</em>, where we found a national consensus against the death penalty for vicarious felony murder despite eight jurisdictions having authorized the practice.  See 458 U. S., at 789, 792.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are measures of consensus other than legislation.  Statistics about the number of executions may inform the consideration whether capital punishment for the crime of child rape is regarded as unacceptable in our society.

(cited in Brief for Respondent 42, and n. 38), are the only two individuals now on death row in the United States for a nonhomicide offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After reviewing the authorities informed by contemporary norms, including the history of the death penalty for this and other nonhomicide crimes, current state statutes and new enactments, and the number of executions since 1964, we conclude there is a national consensus against capital punishment for the crime of child rape.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said in other Eighth Amendment cases, objective evidence of contemporary values as it relates to punishment for child rape is entitled to great weight, but it does not end our inquiry.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Constitution contemplates that in the end our own judgment will be brought to bear on the question of the acceptability of the death penalty under the Eighth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coker</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 597 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Roper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 563; <em>Enmund</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 797 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is for us ultimately to judge whether the Eighth Amendment permits imposition of the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d).  We turn, then, to the resolution of the question before us, which is informed by our precedents and our own understanding of the Constitution and the rights it secures.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It must be acknowledged that there are moral grounds to question a rule barring capital punishment for a crime against an individual that did not result in death.  These facts illustrate the point.  Here the victim\xe2\x80\x99s fright, the sense of betrayal, and the nature of her injuries caused more prolonged physical and mental suffering than, say, a sudden killing by an unseen assassin.  The attack was not just on her but on her childhood.  For this reason, we should be most reluctant to rely upon the language of the plurality in <em>Coker</em>, which posited that, for the victim of rape, \xe2\x80\x9clife may not be nearly so happy as it was\xe2\x80\x9d but it is not beyond repair.  433 U. S., at 598.  Rape has a permanent psychological, emotional, and sometimes physical impact on the child.  See C. Bagley &amp; K. King, Child Sexual Abuse: The Search for Healing 2\xe2\x80\x9324, 111\xe2\x80\x93112 (1990); Finkelhor &amp; Browne, Assessing the Long-Term Impact of Child Sexual Abuse: A Review and Conceptualization in Handbook on Sexual Abuse of Children 55\xe2\x80\x9360 (L. Walker ed. 1988).  We cannot dismiss the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not follow, though, that capital punishment is a proportionate penalty for the crime.  The constitutional prohibition against excessive or cruel and unusual punishments mandates that the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to punish \xe2\x80\x9cbe exercised within the limits of civilized standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trop</em>, 356 U. S., at 99, 100 (plurality opinion).  Evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society counsel us to be most hesitant before interpreting the Eighth Amendment to allow the extension of the death penalty, a hesitation that has special force where no life was taken in the commission of the crime.  It is an established principle that decency, in its essence, presumes respect for the individual and thus moderation or restraint in the application of capital punishment.  See <em>id.,</em> at 100.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To date the Court has sought to define and implement this principle, for the most part, in cases involving capital murder.  One approach has been to insist upon general rules that ensure consistency in determining who receives a death sentence.  See <em>California</em> v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/538/index.html">479 U. S. 538</a>, 541 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]eath penalty statutes [must] be structured so as to prevent the penalty from being administered in an arbitrary and unpredictable fashion\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <em>Gregg, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html">428 U.

S. 420</a>, 428 (1980) (plurality opinion) (requiring a State to give narrow and precise definition to the aggravating factors that warrant its imposition).  At the same time the Court has insisted, to ensure restraint and moderation in use of capital punishment, on judging the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter and record of the individual offender and the circumstances of the particular offense as a constitutionally indispensable part of the process of inflicting the penalty of death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodson</em>, 428 U.

See <em>Tuilaepa</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/967/index.html">512 U. S. 967</a>, 973 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe objectives of these two inquiries can be in some tension, at least when the inquiries occur at the same time\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Walton</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/639/index.html">497 U. S. 639</a>, 664\xe2\x80\x93665 (1990) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe latter requirement quite obviously destroys whatever rationality and predictability the former requirement was designed to achieve\xe2\x80\x9d).  This has led some Members of the Court to say we should cease efforts to resolve the tension and simply allow legislatures, prosecutors, courts, and juries greater latitude.  See <em>id., </em>at 667\xe2\x80\x93673 (advocating that the Court adhere to the <em>Furman </em>line of cases and abandon the <em>Woodson</em>-<em>Lockett</em> line of cases).  For others the failure to limit these same imprecisions by stricter enforcement of narrowing rules has raised doubts concerning the constitutionality of capital punishment itself.  See <em>Baze</em> v. <em>Rees</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2008) (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9317) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment); <em>Furman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 310\xe2\x80\x93314 (White, J., concurring); <em>Callins</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/1141/index.html">510 U.

See <em>Gregg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 187, 184 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.) (because \xe2\x80\x9cdeath as a punishment is unique in its severity and irrevocability,\xe2\x80\x9d capital punishment must be reserved for those crimes that are \xe2\x80\x9cso grievous an affront to humanity that the only adequate response may be the penalty of death\xe2\x80\x9d (citing in part <em>Furman</em>, 408 U. S., at 286\xe2\x80\x93291 (Brennan, J., concurring); <em>id.,</em> at 306 (Stewart, J., concurring))); see also <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 569 (the Eighth Amendment requires that \xe2\x80\x9cthe death penalty is reserved for a narrow category of crimes and offenders\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our concern here is limited to crimes against individual persons.  We do not address, for example, crimes defining and punishing treason, espionage, terrorism, and drug kingpin activity, which are offenses against the State.  As it relates to crimes against individuals, though, the death penalty should not be expanded to instances where the victim\xe2\x80\x99s life was not taken.  We said in <em>Coker </em>of adult rape:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not discount the seriousness of rape as a crime.  It is highly reprehensible, both in a moral sense and in its almost total contempt for the personal integrity and autonomy of the female victim\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Short of homicide, it is the \xe2\x80\x98ultimate violation of self.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0 [But] [t]he murderer kills; the rapist, if no more than that, does not\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0 We have the abiding conviction that the death penalty, which \xe2\x80\x98is unique in its severity and irrevocability,\xe2\x80\x99 is an excessive penalty for the rapist who, as such, does not take human life.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 U. S., at 597\xe2\x80\x93598 (plurality opinion) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same distinction between homicide and other serious violent offenses against the individual informed the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in <em>Enmund</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html"></a><a href="/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a>, where the Court held that the death penalty for the crime of vicarious felony murder is disproportionate to the offense.  The Court repeated there the fundamental, moral distinction between a \xe2\x80\x9cmurderer\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9crobber,\xe2\x80\x9d noting that while \xe2\x80\x9crobbery is a serious crime deserving serious punishment,\xe2\x80\x9d it is not like death in its \xe2\x80\x9cseverity and irrevocability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 797 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consistent with evolving standards of decency and the teachings of our precedents we conclude that, in determining whether the death penalty is excessive, there is a distinction between intentional first-degree murder on the one hand and nonhomicide crimes against individual persons, even including child rape, on the other.  The latter crimes may be devastating in their harm, as here, but \xe2\x80\x9cin terms of moral depravity and of the injury to the person and to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 598 (plurality opinion), they cannot be compared to murder in their \xe2\x80\x9cseverity and irrevocability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching our conclusion we find significant the number of executions that would be allowed under respondent\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  The crime of child rape, considering its reported incidents, occurs more often than first-degree murder.  Approximately 5,702 incidents of vaginal, anal, or oral rape of a child under the age of 12 were reported nationwide in 2005; this is almost twice the total incidents of intentional murder for victims of all ages (3,405) reported during the same period.  See Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research, National Incident-Based Reporting System, 2005, Study No. 4720, http://www.icpsr.umich.edu (as visited June 12, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Although we have no reliable statistics on convictions for child rape, we can surmise that, each year, there are hundreds, or more, of these convictions just in jurisdictions that permit capital punishment.  Cf. Brief for Louisiana Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 1\xe2\x80\x932, and n.\xc2\xa02 (noting that there are now at least 70 capital rape indictments pending in Louisiana and estimating the actual number to be over 100).  As a result of existing rules, see generally <em>Godfrey</em>, 446 U. S., at 428\xe2\x80\x93433 (plurality opinion), only 2.2% of convicted first-degree murderers are sentenced to death, see Blume, Eisenberg, &amp; Wells, Explaining Death Row\xe2\x80\x99s Population and Racial Composition, 1 J. of Empirical Legal Studies 165, 171 (2004).  But under respondent\xe2\x80\x99s approach, the 36 States that permit the death penalty could sentence to death all persons convicted of raping a child less than 12 years of age.  This could not be reconciled with our evolving standards of decency and the necessity to constrain the use of the death penalty.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It might be said that narrowing aggravators could be used in this context, as with murder offenses, to ensure the death penalty\xe2\x80\x99s restrained application.  We find it difficult to identify standards that would guide the decisionmaker so the penalty is reserved for the most severe cases of child rape and yet not imposed in an arbitrary way.  Even were we to forbid, say, the execution of first-time child rapists, see <em>supra </em>at 12, or require as an aggravating factor a finding that the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s instant rape offense involved multiple victims, the jury still must balance, in its discretion, those aggravating factors against mitigating circumstances.  In this context, which involves a crime that in many cases will overwhelm a decent person\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, we have no confidence that the imposition of the death penalty would not be so arbitrary as to be \xe2\x80\x9cfreakis[h],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Furman, </em>408 U. S.,<em> </em>at 310 (Stewart, J., concurring).  We cannot sanction this result when the harm to the victim, though grave, cannot be quantified in the same way as death of the victim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not a solution simply to apply to this context the aggravating factors developed for capital murder.  The Court has said that a State may carry out its obligation to ensure individualized sentencing in capital murder cases by adopting sentencing processes that rely upon the jury to exercise wide discretion so long as there are narrowing factors that have some \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98common-sense core of meaning \xe2\x80\xa6 that criminal juries should be capable of understanding.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tuilaepa</em>, 512 U. S., at 975 (quoting <em>Jurek</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/index.html">428 U. S. 262</a>, 279 (1976) (White, J., concurring in judgment)).  The Court, accordingly, has upheld the constitutionality of aggravating factors ranging from whether the defendant was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cold-blooded, pitiless slayer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Arave</em> v. <em>Creech</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/463/index.html">507 U. S. 463</a>, 471\xe2\x80\x93474 (1993), to whether the \xe2\x80\x9cperpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Walton</em>, 497 U. S., at 654, to whether the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jurek</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 269-270, 274\xe2\x80\x93276 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.).  All of these standards have the potential to result in some inconsistency of application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted above, the resulting imprecision and the tension between evaluating the individual circumstances and consistency of treatment have been tolerated where the victim dies.  It should not be introduced into our justice system, though, where death has not occurred.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our concerns are all the more pronounced where, as here, the death penalty for this crime has been most infrequent.  See Part III\xe2\x80\x93D, <em>supra.</em>  We have developed a foundational jurisprudence in the case of capital murder to guide the States and juries in imposing the death penalty.  Starting with <em>Gregg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>,<em> </em>we have spent more than 32 years articulating limiting factors that channel the jury\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to avoid the death penalty\xe2\x80\x99s arbitrary imposition in the case of capital murder.  Though that practice remains sound, beginning the same process for crimes for which no one has been executed in more than 40 years would require experimentation in an area where a failed experiment would result in the execution of individuals undeserving of the death penalty.  Evolving standards of decency are difficult to reconcile with a regime that seeks to expand the death penalty to an area where standards to confine its use are indefinite and obscure.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision is consistent with the justifications offered for the death penalty.  <em>Gregg</em> instructs that capital punishment is excessive when it is grossly out of proportion to the crime or it does not fulfill the two distinct social purposes served by the death penalty: retribution and deterrence of capital crimes.  See <em>id.</em>, at 173, 183, 187 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.); see also <em>Coker, </em>433 U. S., at 592 (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cA punishment might fail the test on either ground\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Coker</em>, here it cannot be said with any certainty that the death penalty for child rape serves no deterrent or retributive function.  See <em>id.</em>, at 593, n.\xc2\xa04 (concluding that the death penalty for rape might serve \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate ends of punishment\xe2\x80\x9d but nevertheless is disproportionate to the crime).  Cf. <em>Gregg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 185\xe2\x80\x93186 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no convincing empirical evidence either supporting or refuting th[e] view [that the death penalty serves as a significantly greater deterrent than lesser penalties].  We may nevertheless assume safely that there are murderers \xe2\x80\xa6 for whom .\xc2\xa0. . the death penalty undoubtedly is a significant deterrent\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 186 (the value of capital punishment, and its contribution to acceptable penological goals, typically is a \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex factual issue the resolution of which properly rests with the legislatures\xe2\x80\x9d).  This argument does not overcome other objections, however.  The incongruity between the crime of child rape and the harshness of the death penalty poses risks of overpunishment and counsels against a constitutional ruling that the death penalty can be expanded to include this offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The goal of retribution, which reflects society\xe2\x80\x99s and the victim\xe2\x80\x99s interests in seeing that the offender is repaid for the hurt he caused, see <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 319; <em>Furman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 308 (Stewart, J., concurring), does not justify the harshness of the death penalty here.  In measuring retribution, as well as other objectives of criminal law, it is appropriate to distinguish between a particularly depraved murder that merits death as a form of retribution and the crime of child rape.  See Part IV\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>;<em> Coker, supra, </em>at 597\xe2\x80\x93598 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is an additional reason for our conclusion that imposing the death penalty for child rape would not further retributive purposes.  In considering whether retribution is served, among other factors we have looked to whether capital punishment \xe2\x80\x9chas the potential \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0to allow the community as a whole, including the surviving family and friends of the victim, to affirm its own judgment that the culpability of the prisoner is so serious that the ultimate penalty must be sought and imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Panetti</em> v. <em>Quarterman</em>, 551 U. S. ___, ____ (2007) (slip op., at 26).  In considering the death penalty for nonhomicide offenses this inquiry necessarily also must include the question whether the death penalty balances the wrong to the victim.   Cf.  <em>Roper, </em>543 U. S., at 571.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not at all evident that the child rape victim\xe2\x80\x99s hurt is lessened when the law permits the death of the perpetrator.  Capital cases require a long-term commitment by those who testify for the prosecution, especially when guilt and sentencing determinations are in multiple proceedings.  In cases like this the key testimony is not just from the family but from the victim herself.  During formative years of her adolescence, made all the more daunting for having to come to terms with the brutality of her experience, L. H. was required to discuss the case at length with law enforcement personnel.  In a public trial she was required to recount once more all the details of the crime to a jury as the State pursued the death of her stepfather.  Cf. G. Goodman et\xc2\xa0al., Testifying in Criminal Court: Emotional Effects on Child Sexual Assault Victims 50, 62, 72 (1992); Brief for National Association of Social Workers et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>as <em>Amici Curiae </em>17\xe2\x80\x9321.  And in the end the State made L. H. a central figure in its decision to seek the death penalty, telling the jury in closing statements: \xe2\x80\x9c[L. H.] is asking you, asking you to set up a time and place when he dies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 121 (Aug. 26, 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Society\xe2\x80\x99s desire to inflict the death penalty for child rape by enlisting the child victim to assist it over the course of years in asking for capital punishment forces a moral choice on the child, who is not of mature age to make that choice.  The way the death penalty here involves the child victim in its enforcement can compromise a decent legal system; and this is but a subset of fundamental difficulties capital punishment can cause in the administration and enforcement of laws proscribing child rape.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are, moreover, serious systemic concerns in prosecuting the crime of child rape that are relevant to the constitutionality of making it a capital offense.  The problem of unreliable, induced, and even imagined child testimony means there is a \xe2\x80\x9cspecial risk of wrongful execution\xe2\x80\x9d in some child rape cases.  <em>Atkins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 321.  See also Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 5\xe2\x80\x9317.  This undermines, at least to some degree, the meaningful contribution of the death penalty to legitimate goals of punishment.  Studies conclude that children are highly susceptible to suggestive questioning techniques like repetition, guided imagery, and selective reinforcement.  See Ceci &amp; Friedman, The Suggestibility of Children: Scientific Research and Legal Implications, 86 Cornell L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 33, 47 (2000) (there is \xe2\x80\x9cstrong evidence that children, especially young children, are suggestible to a significant degree\xe2\x80\x94even on abuse-related questions\xe2\x80\x9d); Gross, Jacoby, Matheson, Montgomery, &amp; Patil, Exonerations in the United States 1989 Through 2003, 95 J. Crim. L. &amp; C. 523, 539 (2005) (discussing allegations of abuse at the Little Rascals Day Care Center); see also Quas, Davis, Goodman, &amp; Myers, Repeated Questions, Deception, and Children\xe2\x80\x99s True and False Reports of Body Touch, 12 Child Maltreatment 60, 61\xe2\x80\x9366 (2007) (finding that 4- to 7-year-olds \xe2\x80\x9cwere able to maintain [a] lie about body touch fairly effectively when asked repeated, direct questions during a mock forensic interview\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similar criticisms pertain to other cases involving child witnesses; but child rape cases present heightened concerns because the central narrative and account of the crime often comes from the child herself.  She and the accused are, in most instances, the only ones present when the crime was committed.  See <em>Pennsylvania</em> v. <em>Ritchie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/39/index.html">480 U. S. 39</a>, 60 (1987).  Cf. Goodman, Testifying in Criminal Court, at 118.  And the question in a capital case is not just the fact of the crime, including, say, proof of rape as distinct from abuse short of rape, but details bearing upon brutality in its commission.  These matters are subject to fabrication or exaggeration, or both.  See Ceci and Friedman, <em>supra;</em> Quas, <em>supra.  </em>Although capital punishment does bring retribution, and the legislature here has chosen to use it for this end, its judgment must be weighed, in deciding the constitutional question, against the special risks of unreliable testimony with respect to this crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to deterrence, if the death penalty adds to the risk of non-reporting, that, too, diminishes the penalty\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.  Underreporting is a common problem with respect to child sexual abuse.  See Hanson, Resnick, Saunders, Kilpatrick, &amp; Best, Factors Related to the Reporting of Childhood Rape, 23 Child Abuse &amp; Neglect 559, 564 (1999) (finding that about 88% of female rape victims under the age of 18 did not disclose their abuse to authorities); Smith et\xc2\xa0al., Delay in Disclosure of Childhood Rape: Results From A National Survey, 24 Child Abuse &amp; Neglect 273, 278\xe2\x80\x93279 (2000) (finding that 72% of women raped as children disclosed their abuse to someone, but that only 12% of the victims reported the rape to authorities).  Although we know little about what differentiates those who report from those who do not report, see Hanson, <em>supra</em>, at 561, one of the most commonly cited reasons for nondisclosure is fear of negative consequences for the perpetrator, a concern that has special force where the abuser is a family member, see Goodman-Brown, Edelstein, Goodman, Jones, &amp; Gordon, Why Children Tell: A Model of Children\xe2\x80\x99s Disclosure of Sexual Abuse, 27 Child Abuse &amp; Neglect 525, 527\xe2\x80\x93528 (2003); Smith, <em>supra, </em>at 283\xe2\x80\x93284 (finding that, where there was a relationship between perpetrator and victim, the victim was likely to keep the abuse a secret for a longer period of time, perhaps because of a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater sense of loyalty or emotional bond\xe2\x80\x9d); Hanson, <em>supra</em>, at 565\xe2\x80\x93566, and Table 3 (finding that a \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater proportion of reported than nonreported cases involved a stranger\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>Ritchie</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 60.  The experience of the <em>amici </em>who work with child victims indicates that, when the punishment is death, both the victim and the victim\xe2\x80\x99s family members may be more likely to shield the perpetrator from discovery, thus increasing underreporting.  See Brief for National Association of Social Workers et\xc2\xa0al.<em> </em>as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  As a result, punishment by death may not result in more deterrence or more effective enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, by in effect making the punishment for child rape and murder equivalent, a State that punishes child rape by death may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim.  Assuming the offender behaves in a rational way, as one must to justify the penalty on grounds of deterrence, the penalty in some respects gives less protection, not more, to the victim, who is often the sole witness to the crime.  See Rayburn, Better Dead Than R(ap)ed?: The Patriarchal Rhetoric Driving Capital Rape Statutes, 78 St. John\xe2\x80\x99s L. Rev. 1119, 1159\xe2\x80\x931160 (2004).  It might be argued that, even if the death penalty results in a marginal increase in the incentive to kill, this is counterbalanced by a marginally increased deterrent to commit the crime at all.  Whatever balance the legislature strikes, however, uncertainty on the point makes the argument for the penalty less compelling than for homicide crimes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of these propositions, standing alone, might not establish the unconstitutionality of the death penalty for the crime of child rape.  Taken in sum, however, they demonstrate the serious negative consequences of making child rape a capital offense.  These considerations lead us to conclude, in our independent judgment, that the death penalty is not a proportional punishment for the rape of a child.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our determination that there is a consensus against the death penalty for child rape raises the question whether the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own institutional position and its holding will have the effect of blocking further or later consensus in favor of the penalty from developing.  The Court, it will be argued, by the act of addressing the constitutionality of the death penalty, intrudes upon the consensus-making process.  By imposing a negative restraint, the argument runs, the Court makes it more difficult for consensus to change or emerge.  The Court, according to the criticism, itself becomes enmeshed in the process, part judge and part the maker of that which it judges.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These concerns overlook the meaning and full substance of the established proposition that the Eighth Amendment is defined by \xe2\x80\x9cthe evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Trop</em>, 356 U. S., at 101 (plurality opinion).  Confirmed by repeated, consistent rulings of this Court, this principle requires that use of the death penalty be restrained.  The rule of evolving standards of decency with specific marks on the way to full progress and mature judgment means that resort to the penalty must be reserved for the worst of crimes and limited in its instances of application.  In most cases justice is not better served by terminating the life of the perpetrator rather than confining him and preserving the possibility that he and the system will find ways to allow him to understand the enormity of his offense.  Difficulties in administering the penalty to ensure against its arbitrary and capricious application require adherence to a rule reserving its use, at this stage of evolving standards and in cases of crimes against individuals, for crimes that take the life of the victim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana upholding the capital sentence is reversed.

This is so, according to the Court, no matter how young the child, no matter how many times the child is raped, no matter how many children the perpetrator rapes, no matter how sadistic the crime, no matter how much physical or psychological trauma is inflicted, and no matter how heinous the perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s prior criminal record may be.  The Court provides two reasons for this sweeping conclusion: First, the Court claims to have identified \xe2\x80\x9ca national consensus\xe2\x80\x9d that the death penalty is never acceptable for the rape of a child; second, the Court concludes, based on its \xe2\x80\x9cindependent judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d that imposing the death penalty for child rape is inconsistent with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8, 15, 16 (citation omitted).  Because neither of these justifications is sound, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn first to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim that there is \xe2\x80\x9ca national consensus\xe2\x80\x9d that it is never acceptable to impose the death penalty for the rape of a child.  The Eighth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, the Court writes, are \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined not by the standards that prevailed\xe2\x80\x9d when the Amendment was adopted but \xe2\x80\x9cby the norms that \xe2\x80\x98currently prevail.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting <em>Atkins </em>v.<em> Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, 311 (2002)).  In assessing current norms, the Court relies primarily on the fact that only 6 of the 50 States now have statutes that permit the death penalty for this offense.  But this statistic is a highly unreliable indicator of the views of state lawmakers and their constituents.  As I will explain, dicta in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Coker </em>v.<em> Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/584/index.html">433 U. S. 584</a> (1977), has stunted legislative consideration of the question whether the death penalty for the targeted offense of raping a young child is consistent with prevailing standards of decency.  The <em>Coker</em> dicta gave state legislators and others good reason to fear that any law permitting the imposition of the death penalty for this crime would meet precisely the fate that has now befallen the Louisiana statute that is currently before us, and this threat strongly discouraged state legislators\xe2\x80\x94regardless of their own values and those of their constituents\xe2\x80\x94from supporting the enactment of such legislation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court correctly concludes, the <em>holding </em>in <em>Coker</em> was that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty for the rape of an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adult woman,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and thus <em>Coker</em> does not control our decision here.  See <em>ante, </em>at 17.  But the reasoning of the Justices in the majority had broader implications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two Members of the <em>Coker</em> majority, Justices Brennan and Marshall, took the position that the death penalty is always unconstitutional.  433 U. S., at 600 (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment) and (Marshall, J., concurring in judgment).  Four other Justices, who joined the controlling plurality opinion, suggested that the Georgia capital rape statute was unconstitutional for the simple reason that the impact of a rape, no matter how heinous, is not grievous enough to justify capital punishment.  In the words of the plurality: \xe2\x80\x9cLife is over for the victim of the murderer; for the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was, but it is not over and normally is not beyond repair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 598.  The plurality summarized its position as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have the abiding conviction that the death penalty . . . is an excessive penalty for the rapist who, as such, does not take human life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The implications of the <em>Coker</em> plurality opinion were plain.  Justice Powell, who concurred in the judgment overturning the death sentence in the case at hand, did not join the plurality opinion because he understood it to draw \xe2\x80\x9ca bright line between murder and all rapes\xe2\x80\x94regardless of the degree of brutality of the rape or the effect upon the victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 603.  If Justice Powell read <em>Coker</em> that way, it was reasonable for state legislatures to do the same.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Understandably, state courts have frequently read <em>Coker</em> in precisely this way.  The Court is correct that state courts have generally understood the limited scope of the <em>holding </em>in <em>Coker</em>, <em>ante, </em>at 18, but lower courts and legislators also take into account\xe2\x80\x94and I presume that this Court wishes them to continue to take into account\xe2\x80\x94the Court\xe2\x80\x99s dicta.  And that is just what happened in the wake of <em>Coker</em>.  Four years after <em>Coker,</em> when Florida\xe2\x80\x99s capital child rape statute was challenged, the Florida Supreme Court, while correctly noting that this Court had not <em>held</em> that the Eighth Amendment bars the death penalty for child rape, concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he reasoning of the justices in <em>Coker v. Georgia</em> compels us to hold that a sentence of death is grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment for the crime of sexual assault and is therefore forbidden by the Eighth Amendment as cruel and unusual punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buford </em>v.<em> State</em>, 403 So.\xc2\xa02d 943, 951 (1981).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Numerous other state courts have interpreted the <em>Coker</em> dicta similarly.  See <em>State </em>v.<em> Barnum</em>, 921 So.\xc2\xa02d 513, 526 (Fla. 2005) (citing <em>Coker</em> as holding that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a sentence of death is grossly disproportionate and excessive punishment for the crime of rape,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d not merely the rape of an adult woman); <em>People </em>v.<em> Huddleston</em>, 212 Ill. 2d. 107, 141, 816 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 322, 341 (2004) (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutionality of state statutes that impose the death penalty for nonhomicide crimes is the subject of debate\xe2\x80\x9d after <em>Coker</em>); <em>People </em>v.<em> Hernandez</em>, 30 Cal. 4th 835, 867, 69 P.\xc2\xa03d 446, 464\xe2\x80\x93467 (2003) (<em>Coker</em> \xe2\x80\x9crais[ed] serious doubts that the federal Constitution permitted the death penalty for any offense not requiring the actual taking of human life\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough the high court did not expressly hold [in <em>Coker</em>] that the Eighth Amendment prohibits capital punishment for <em>all</em> crimes not resulting in death, the plurality stressed that the crucial difference between rape and murder is that a rapist \xe2\x80\x98does not take human life\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State </em>v.<em> Gardner</em>, 947 P.\xc2\xa02d 630, 653 (Utah 1997) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Coker</em> holding leaves no room for the conclusion that any rape, even an \xe2\x80\x98inhuman\xe2\x80\x99 one involving torture and aggravated battery but not resulting in death, would constitutionally sustain imposition of the death penalty\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Parker </em>v.<em> State</em>, 216 Ga.

The enactment and implementation of any new state death penalty statute\xe2\x80\x94and particularly a new type of statute such as one that specifically targets the rape of young children\xe2\x80\x94imposes many costs.  There is the burden of drafting an innovative law that must take into account this Court\xe2\x80\x99s exceedingly complex Eighth Amendment jurisprudence.  Securing passage of controversial legislation may interfere in a variety of ways with the enactment of other bills on the legislative agenda.  Once the statute is enacted, there is the burden of training and coordinating the efforts of those who must implement the new law.  Capital prosecutions are qualitatively more difficult than noncapital prosecutions and impose special emotional burdens on all involved.  When a capital sentence is imposed under the new law, there is the burden of keeping the prisoner on death row and the lengthy and costly project of defending the constitutionality of the statute on appeal and in collateral proceedings.  And if the law is eventually overturned, there is the burden of new proceedings on remand.  Moreover, conscientious state lawmakers, whatever their personal views about the morality of imposing the death penalty for child rape, may defer to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s dicta, either because they respect our authority and expertise in interpreting the Constitution or merely because they do not relish the prospect of being held to have violated the Constitution and contravened prevailing \xe2\x80\x9cstandards of decency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Accordingly, the <em>Coker</em> dicta gave state legislators a strong incentive not to push for the enactment of new capital child-rape laws even though these legislators and their constituents may have believed that the laws would be appropriate and desirable.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court expresses doubt that the <em>Coker</em> dicta had this effect, but the skepticism is unwarranted.  It would be quite remarkable if state legislators were not influenced by the considerations noted above.  And although state legislatures typically do not create legislative materials like those produced by Congress, there is evidence that proposals to permit the imposition of the death penalty for child rape were opposed on the ground that enactment would be futile and costly.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Oklahoma, the opposition to the State\xe2\x80\x99s capital child-rape statute argued that <em>Coker</em> had already ruled the death penalty unconstitutional as applied to cases of\nrape.  See Oklahoma Senate News Release, Senator\nNichols Targets Child Predators with Death Penalty, Child Abuse Response Team, May 26, 2006, on line at http://www.oksenate.gov/news/press_releases/press_releases_\n2006/pr20060526d.htm (all Internet materials as visited June 23, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Likewise, opponents of South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s capital child-rape law contended that the statute would waste state resources because it would undoubtedly be held unconstitutional.  See The State, Death Penalty Plan in Spotlight: Attorney General to Advise Senate Panel on Proposal for Repeat Child Rapists, Mar. 28, 2006 (quoting Laura Hudson, spokeswoman for the S.\xc2\xa0C. Victim Assistance Network, as stating that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]e don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be wasting state money to have an appeal to the [United States] Supreme Court, knowing we are going to lose it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Representative Fletcher Smith of the South Carolina House of Representatives forecast that the bill would not meet constitutional standards because \xe2\x80\x9cdeath isn\xe2\x80\x99t involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Davenport, Emotion Drives Child Rape Death Penalty Debate in South Carolina, Associated Press, Apr. 4, 2006.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In Texas, opponents of that State\xe2\x80\x99s capital child-rape law argued that <em>Coker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning doomed the proposal.

S. 551</a> (2005).  See <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  <em>Atkins </em>concerned the constitutionality of imposing the death penalty on a mentally retarded defendant.  Thirteen years earlier, in <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a> (1989), the Court had held that this was permitted by the Eighth Amendment, and therefore, during the time between <em>Penry </em>and<em> Atkins, </em>state legislators had reason to believe that this Court would follow its prior precedent and uphold statutes allowing such punishment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The situation in <em>Roper</em> was similar.  <em>Roper</em> concerned a challenge to the constitutionality of imposing the death penalty on a defendant who had not reached the age of 18 at the time of the crime.  Sixteen years earlier in <em>Stanford</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/361/index.html">492 U. S. 361</a> (1989), the Court had rejected a similar challenge, and therefore state lawmakers had cause to believe that laws allowing such punishment would be sustained.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When state lawmakers believe that their decision will prevail on the question whether to permit the death penalty for a particular crime or class of offender, the legislators\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of the issue can be interpreted as an expression of their own judgment, informed by whatever weight they attach to the values of their constituents.  But when state legislators think that the enactment of a new death penalty law is likely to be futile, inaction cannot reasonably be interpreted as an expression of their understanding of prevailing societal values.  In that atmosphere, legislative inaction is more likely to evidence acquiescence.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If anything can be inferred from state legislative developments, the message is very different from the one that the Court perceives.  In just the past few years, despite the shadow cast by the <em>Coker</em> dicta, five States have\nenacted targeted capital child-rape laws.  See Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x931 (1999); Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa745\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93503 (1997); Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, \xc2\xa77115(K) (West Supp. 2008); S.\xc2\xa0C.

If, as the Court seems to think, our society is \xe2\x80\x9c[e]volving\xe2\x80\x9d toward ever higher \xe2\x80\x9cstandards of decency,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 36, these enactments might represent the beginning of a new evolutionary line.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Such a development would not be out of step with changes in our society\xe2\x80\x99s thinking since <em>Coker</em> was decided.  During that time, reported instances of child abuse have increased dramatically;[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and there are many indications of growing alarm about the sexual abuse of children.  In 1994, Congress enacted the Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa714071 (2000 ed. and Supp. V), which requires States receiving certain federal funds to establish registration systems for convicted sex offenders and to  notify the public about persons convicted of the sexual abuse of minors.  All 50 States have now enacted such statutes.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In addition, at least 21 States and the District of Columbia now have statutes permitting\nthe involuntary commitment of sexual predators,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and at least 12 States have enacted residency restrictions for sex offenders.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seeking to counter the significance of the new capital child-rape laws enacted during the past two years, the Court points out that in recent months efforts to enact similar laws in five other States have stalled.  <em>Ante</em>, at 21.  These developments, however, all took place after our decision to grant certiorari in this case, see 552 U. S. ___ (2008), which gave state legislators reason to delay the enactment of new legislation until the constitutionality of such laws was clarified.  And there is no evidence of which I am aware that these legislative initiatives failed because the proposed laws were viewed as inconsistent with our society\xe2\x80\x99s standards of decency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the contrary, the available evidence suggests otherwise.  For example, in Colorado, the Senate Appropriations Committee in April voted 6 to 4 against Senate Bill 195, reportedly because it \xe2\x80\x9cwould have cost about $616,000 next year for trials, appeals, public defenders, and prison costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Associated Press, Lawmakers Reject Death Penalty for Child Sex Abusers, Denver Post, Apr. 11, 2008.  Likewise, in Tennessee, the capital child-rape bill was withdrawn in committee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the high associated costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  The bill\xe2\x80\x99s sponsor stated that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[b]e-cause of the state\xe2\x80\x99s budget situation, we thought to withdraw that bill\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  We\xe2\x80\x99ll revisit it next year to see if we can reduce the cost of the fiscal note.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Green, Small Victory in Big Fight for Tougher Sex Abuse Laws, The Leaf-Chronicle, May 8, 2008, p.\xc2\xa01A.  Thus, the failure to enact capital child-rape laws cannot be viewed as evidence of a moral consensus against such punishment.</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Aside from its misleading tally of current state laws, the Court points to two additional \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 11, but these arguments are patent makeweights.  The Court notes that Congress has not enacted a law permitting the death penalty for the rape of a child, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, but due to the territorial limits of the relevant federal statutes, very few rape cases, not to mention child-rape cases, are prosecuted in federal court.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72241, 2242 (2000 ed. and Supp. V); United States Sentencing Commission, Report to Congress: Analysis of Penalties for Federal Rape Cases, p.\xc2\xa010, Table 1.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enact a death penalty statute for this tiny set of cases is hardly evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 assessment of our society\xe2\x80\x99s values.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court argues that statistics about the number of executions in rape cases support its perception of a \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus,\xe2\x80\x9d but here too the statistics do not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position.  The Court notes that the last execution for the rape of a child occurred in 1964, <em>ante</em>, at 23, but the Court fails to mention that litigation regarding the constitutionality of the death penalty brought executions to a halt across the board in the late 1960\xe2\x80\x99s.  In 1965 and 1966, there were a total of eight executions for all offenses, and from 1968 until 1977, the year when <em>Coker</em> was decided, there were no executions for any crimes.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court also fails to mention that in Louisiana, since the state law was amended in 1995 to make child rape a capital offense, prosecutors have asked juries to return death verdicts in four cases.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Dickerson</em>, 01\xe2\x80\x931287 (La. App. 6/26/02), 822 So.\xc2\xa02d 849 (2002); <em>State</em> v. <em>LeBlanc</em>, 01\xe2\x80\x931322 (La.

(cited in Brief for Respondent 42, and n. 38).  In two of those cases, Louisiana juries imposed the death penalty.  See 2005\xe2\x80\x931981 (La. Sup. Ct. 5/22/07), 957 So.\xc2\xa02d 757; <em>Davis, supra.</em>  This 50% record is hardly evidence that juries share the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that the death penalty for the rape of a young child is unacceptable under even the most aggravated circumstances.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">F</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the points discussed above, I believe that the \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia\xe2\x80\x9d of our society\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cevolving standards of decency\xe2\x80\x9d can be fairly summarized as follows.  Neither Congress nor juries have done anything that can plausibly be interpreted as evidencing the \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court perceives.  State legislatures, for more than 30 years, have operated under the ominous shadow of the <em>Coker</em> dicta and thus have not been free to express their own understanding of our society\xe2\x80\x99s standards of decency.  And in the months following our grant of certiorari in this case, state legislatures have had an additional reason to pause.  Yet despite the inhibiting legal atmosphere that has prevailed since 1977, six States have recently enacted new, targeted child-rape laws.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not suggest that six new state laws necessarily establish a \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus\xe2\x80\x9d or even that they are sure evidence of an ineluctable trend.  In terms of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s metaphor of moral evolution, these enactments might have turned out to be an evolutionary dead end.  But they might also have been the beginning of a strong new evolutionary line.  We will never know, because the Court today snuffs out the line in its incipient stage.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is willing to block the potential emergence of a national consensus in favor of permitting the death penalty for child rape because, in the end, what matters  is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cown judgment\xe2\x80\x9d regarding \xe2\x80\x9cthe acceptability of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  Although the Court has much to say on this issue, most of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion is not pertinent to the Eighth Amendment question at hand.  And once all of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s irrelevant arguments are put aside, it is apparent that the Court has provided no coherent explanation for today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the next section of this opinion, I will attempt to weed out the arguments that are not germane to the Eighth Amendment inquiry, and in the final section, I will address what remains.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A major theme of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is that permitting the death penalty in child-rape cases is not in the best interests of the victims of these crimes and society at large.  In this vein, the Court suggests that it is more painful for child-rape victims to testify when the prosecution is seeking the death penalty.  <em>Ante,</em> at 32.  The Court also argues that \xe2\x80\x9ca State that punishes child rape by death may remove a strong incentive for the rapist not to kill the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 35, and may discourage the reporting of child rape, <em>ante</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These policy arguments, whatever their merits, are simply not pertinent to the question whether the death penalty is \xe2\x80\x9ccruel and unusual\xe2\x80\x9d punishment.  The Eighth Amendment protects the right of an accused.  It does not authorize this Court to strike down federal or state criminal laws on the ground that they are not in the best interests of crime victims or the broader society.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments concern matters that legislators should\xe2\x80\x94and presumably do\xe2\x80\x94take into account in deciding whether to enact a capital child-rape statute, but these arguments are irrelevant to the question that is before us in this case.  Our cases have cautioned against using \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the aegis of the Cruel and Unusual Punishment Clause\xe2\x80\x99 to cut off the normal democratic processes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Atkins</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/304/index.html">536 U. S. 304</a>, 323 (2002) (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., dissenting), in turn quoting <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a>, 176 (1976), (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.), but the Court forgets that warning here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also contends that laws permitting the death penalty for the rape of a child create serious procedural problems.  Specifically, the Court maintains that it is not feasible to channel the exercise of sentencing discretion in child-rape cases, <em>ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329, and that the unreliability of the testimony of child victims creates a danger that innocent defendants will be convicted and executed, <em>ante, </em>at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  Neither of these contentions provides a basis for striking down all capital child-rape laws no matter how carefully and narrowly they are crafted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument regarding the structuring of sentencing discretion is hard to comprehend.  The Court finds it \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult to identify standards that would guide the decisionmaker so the penalty is reserved for the most severe cases of child rape and yet not imposed in an arbitrary way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  Even assuming that the age of a child is not alone a sufficient factor for limiting sentencing discretion, the Court need only examine the child-rape laws recently enacted in Texas, Oklahoma, Montana, and South Carolina, all of which use a concrete factor to limit quite drastically the number of cases in which the death penalty may be imposed.  In those States, a defendant convicted of the rape of a child may be sentenced to death only if the defendant has a prior conviction for a specified felony sex offense.  See Mont. Code Ann. \xc2\xa745\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x93503(3)(c) (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the offender was previously convicted of [a felony sexual offense] . . . the offender shall be \xe2\x80\xa6 punished by death . . .\xe2\x80\x9d); Okla. Stat., Tit. 10, \xc2\xa77115(K) (West Supp. 2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of law, any parent or other person convicted of forcible anal or oral sodomy, rape, rape by instrumentation, or lewd molestation of a child under fourteen (14) years of age subsequent to a previous conviction for any offense of forcible anal or oral sodomy, rape, rape by instrumentation, or lewd molestation of a child under fourteen (14) years of age shall be punished by death\xe2\x80\x9d); S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x93655(C)(1) (Supp. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the [defendant] has previously been convicted of, pled guilty or nolo contendere to, or adjudicated delinquent for first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor who is less than eleven years of age \xe2\x80\xa6 he must be punished by death or by imprisonment for life\xe2\x80\x9d); Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa712.42(c)(3) (2007 Supp.); (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] defendant shall be punished for a capital felony if it is shown on the trial of an offense under Section 22.021 \xe2\x80\xa6 that the defendant has previously been finally convicted of [a felony sexual offense against a victim younger than fourteen years of age]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, it takes little imagination to envision other limiting factors that a State could use to structure sentencing discretion in child rape cases.  Some of these might be: whether the victim was kidnapped, whether the defendant inflicted severe physical injury on the victim, whether the victim was raped multiple times, whether the rapes occurred over a specified extended period, and whether there were multiple victims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court refers to limiting standards that are \xe2\x80\x9cindefinite and obscure,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 30, but there is nothing indefinite or obscure about any of the above-listed aggravating factors.  Indeed, they are far more definite and clear-cut than aggravating factors that we have found to be adequate in murder cases.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Arave</em> v. <em>Creech</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/463/index.html">507 U. S. 463</a>, 471 (1993) (whether the defendant was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cold-blooded, pitiless slayer\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Walton</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/639/index.html">497 U. S. 639</a>, 646 (1990) (whether the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98perpetrator inflict[ed] mental anguish or physical abuse before the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Jurek</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/262/index.html"></a><a href="/us/428/262/index.html">428 U.

(whether the defendant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would commit criminal acts of violence that would constitute a continuing threat to society\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  For these reasons, concerns about limiting sentencing discretion provide no support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s blanket condemnation of all capital child-rape statutes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That sweeping holding is also not justified by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the reliability of the testimony of child victims.  First, the Eighth Amendment provides a poor vehicle for addressing problems regarding the admissibility or reliability of evidence, and problems presented by the testimony of child victims are not unique to capital cases.  Second, concerns about the reliability of the testimony of child witnesses are not present in every child-rape case.  In the case before us, for example, there was undisputed medical evidence that the victim was brutally raped, as well as strong independent evidence that petitioner was the perpetrator.  Third, if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s evidentiary concerns have Eighth Amendment relevance, they could be addressed by allowing the death penalty in only those child-rape cases in which the independent evidence is sufficient to prove all the elements needed for conviction and imposition of a death sentence.  There is precedent for requiring special corroboration in certain criminal cases.  For example, some jurisdictions do not allow a conviction based on the uncorroborated testimony of an accomplice.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ala. Code 12\xe2\x80\x9321\xe2\x80\x93222 (1986); Alaska Stat. \xc2\xa712.45.020 (1984); Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x9389\xe2\x80\x93111(e)(1) (1977); Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71111 (West 1985); Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa724\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x938 (1995); Idaho Code \xc2\xa719\xe2\x80\x932117 (Lexis 1979); Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7634.04 (1983); Mont.

A State wishing to permit the death penalty in child-rape cases could impose an analogous corroboration requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After all the arguments noted above are put aside, what is left?  What remaining grounds does the Court provide to justify its independent judgment that the death penalty for child rape is categorically unacceptable?  I see two.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The first is the proposition that we should be \xe2\x80\x9cmost hesitant before interpreting the Eighth Amendment to allow the <em>extension</em> of the death penalty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 25 (emphasis added); see also <em>ante,</em> at 27, 30 (referring to expansion of the death penalty).  But holding that the Eighth Amendment does not categorically prohibit the death penalty for the rape of a young child would not \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty.  Laws enacted by the state legislatures are presumptively constitutional, <em>Gregg</em>,  428 U. S., at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n assessing a punishment selected by a democratically elected legislature against the constitutional measure, we presume its validity\xe2\x80\x9d),<font b="1"> and until today, this Court has not held that capital child rape laws are unconstitutional, see <em>ante</em>, at 17 (<em>Coker</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak to the constitutionality of the death penalty for child rape, an issue not then before the Court\xe2\x80\x9d).  Consequently, upholding the constitutionality of such a law would not \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty; rather, it would confirm the status of presumptive constitutionality that such laws have enjoyed up to this point.  And in any event, this Court has previously made it clear that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Eighth Amendment is not a ratchet, whereby a temporary consensus on leniency for a particular crime fixes a permanent constitutional maximum, disabling States from giving effect to altered beliefs and responding to changed social conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harmelin</em> v. <em>Michigan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/957/index.html">501 U. S. 957</a>, 990 (1991) (principal opinion); see also <em>Gregg</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 176 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s final\xe2\x80\x94and, it appears, principal\xe2\x80\x94justification for its holding is that murder, the only crime for which defendants have been executed since this Court\xe2\x80\x99s 1976 death penalty decisions,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] is unique in\nits moral depravity and in the severity of the injury that\nit inflicts on the victim and the public.  See <em>ante</em>, at\n27\xe2\x80\x9328.  But the Court makes little attempt to defend these conclusions.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the question of moral depravity, is it really true that every person who is convicted of capital murder and sentenced to death is more morally depraved than every child rapist?  Consider the following two cases.  In the first, a defendant robs a convenience store and watches as his accomplice shoots the store owner.  The defendant acts recklessly, but was not the triggerman and did not intend the killing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Tison</em> v.<em> Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/137/index.html">481 U. S. 137</a> (1987).  In the second case, a previously convicted child rapist kidnaps, repeatedly rapes, and tortures multiple child victims.  Is it clear that the first defendant is more morally depraved than the second?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision here stands in stark contrast to <em>Atkins</em> and <em>Roper</em>, in which the Court concluded that characteristics of the affected defendants\xe2\x80\x94mental retardation in <em>Atkins</em> and youth in <em>Roper</em>\xe2\x80\x94diminished their culpability.  See <em>Atkins</em>, 536 U. S., at 305; <em>Roper</em>, 543 U. S., at 571.  Nor is this case comparable to <em>Enmund</em> v.<em> Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/782/index.html">458 U. S. 782</a> (1982), in which the Court held that the Eighth Amendment prohibits the death penalty where the defendant participated in a robbery during which a murder was committed but did not personally intend for lethal force to be used.  I have no doubt that, under the prevailing standards of our society, robbery, the crime that the petitioner in <em>Enmund</em> intended to commit, does not evidence the same degree of moral depravity as the brutal rape of a young child.  Indeed, I have little doubt that, in the eyes of ordinary Americans, the very worst child rapists\xe2\x80\x94predators who seek out and inflict serious physical and emotional injury on defenseless young children\xe2\x80\x94are the epitome of moral depravity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the question of the harm caused by the rape of child in relation to the harm caused by murder, it is certainly true that the loss of human life represents a unique harm, but that does not explain why other grievous harms are insufficient to permit a death sentence.  And the Court does not take the position that no harm other than the loss of life is sufficient.  The Court takes pains to limit its holding to \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes against individual persons\xe2\x80\x9d and to exclude \xe2\x80\x9coffenses against the State,\xe2\x80\x9d a category that the Court stretches\xe2\x80\x94without explanation\xe2\x80\x94to include \xe2\x80\x9cdrug kingpin activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  But the Court makes no effort to explain why the harm caused by such crimes is necessarily greater than the harm caused by the rape of young children.  This is puzzling in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ape has a permanent psychological, emotional, and sometimes physical impact on the child.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 24.  As the Court aptly recognizes, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e cannot dismiss the years of long anguish that must be endured by the victim of child rape.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rape of any victim inflicts great injury, and \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome victims are so grievously injured physically or psychologically that life <em>is</em> beyond repair.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coker</em>, 433 U.

Commentators have noted correlations between childhood sexual abuse and later problems such as substance abuse, dangerous sexual behaviors or dysfunction, inability to relate to others on an interpersonal level, and psychiatric illness.  Broughton, <em>supra</em>, at 38; Glazer, <em>supra,</em> at 89; Handbook on Sexual Abuse of Children 7 (L. Walker ed. 1988).  Victims of child rape are nearly 5 times more likely than nonvictims to be arrested for sex crimes and nearly 30 times more likely to be arrested for prostitution.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The harm that is caused to the victims and to society at large by the worst child rapists is grave.  It is the judgment of the Louisiana lawmakers and those in an increasing number of other States that these harms justify the death penalty.  The Court provides no cogent explanation why this legislative judgment should be overridden.  Conclusory references to \xe2\x80\x9cdecency,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cmoderation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crestraint,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfull progress,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmoral judgment\xe2\x80\x9d are not enough.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In summary, the Court holds that the Eighth Amendment categorically rules out the death penalty in even the most extreme cases of child rape even though: (1) This holding is not supported by the original meaning of the Eighth Amendment; (2) neither <em>Coker</em> nor any other prior precedent commands this result; (3) there are no reliable \xe2\x80\x9cobjective indicia\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cnational consensus\xe2\x80\x9d in support of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s position; (4) sustaining the constitutionality of the state law before us would not \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpand\xe2\x80\x9d the death penalty; (5) this Court has previously rejected the proposition that the Eighth Amendment is a one-way ratchet that prohibits legislatures from adopting new capital punishment statutes to meet new problems; (6) the worst child rapists exhibit the epitome of moral depravity; and (7) child rape inflicts grievous injury on victims and on society in general.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The party attacking the constitutionality of a state statute bears the \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d of establishing that the law is unconstitutional.  <em>Gregg</em>, 428 U. S., at 175 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens,\xc2\xa0JJ.).  That burden has not been discharged here, and I would therefore affirm the decision of the Louisiana Supreme Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Commentators have expressed similar views.
