W. Woolworth Co. received from foreign subsidiaries that do no business in New Mexico.  We also must decide whether New Mexico may include within Woolworth\'s apportionable New Mexico income a sum, commonly known as "gross-up," that Woolworth calculated in order to claim a foreign tax credit on its federal income tax.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Woolworth\'s principal place of business and commercial domicile are in New York.  It engages in retail business through chains of stores located in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.  It sells a wide spectrum of merchandise, including dry goods, hardware, small appliances, confections, packaged goods, and fountain items.  In the fiscal year ending January 31, 1977, Woolworth\'s gross domestic sales totalled approximately $2.5 billion, with New Mexico sales amounting to approximately $13 million -- or about 0.5% of the gross figure.  App. 57a.</p>\n<p>Woolworth owns four foreign subsidiaries of relevance to this suit.  Three are wholly owned:  F. W. Woolworth GmbH, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 458 U. S. 357</a></p><p> in Germany; F. W. Woolworth, Ltd., in Canada; and F. W. Woolworth, S. A. de C. V. Mexico.  F. W. Woolworth Co., Ltd., is an English corporation of which Woolworth owns 52.7%, with the remainder held and traded publicly.  These four corporations also engage in chainstore retailing. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Together, they paid Woolworth approximately $39.9 million in dividends during the fiscal year in question.</p>\n<p>New Mexico adopted a version of the Uniform Division of Income for Tax Purposes Act in 1965, N.M.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7-4-1 - 7-4-21 (1981), and joined the Multistate Tax Compact in 1967.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 7-5-1 - 7-5-7 (1981).  <em>See ASARCO Inc. v. Idaho State Tax Comm\'n, ante,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/307/case.html#311">458 U. S. 311</a></span>-312; <em>United States Steel Corp. v. Multistate Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/434/452/case.html">434 U. S. 452</a></span> (1978).  Consequently, the State distinguishes between "business" income, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] which it apportions between it and other States for tax purposes, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and "nonbusiness" income, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which it generally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 458 U. S. 358</a></p><p> allocates to a single State on the basis of commercial domicile. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Woolworth reported its dividend income of $39.9 million from its German, Canadian, Mexican, and English subsidiaries as "nonbusiness" income, none of which was to be allocated to New Mexico.  Woolworth also treated as "nonbusiness" income a $1.6 million gain from a hedging transaction in British pounds.  This transaction was undertaken for the purpose of insuring the payment of the British subsidiary\'s dividend against currency fluctuations.  <em>See</em> App. 52a-54a.  Similarly, Woolworth did not report as New Mexico "business" income $25.5 million of "gross-up" that it never actually received, but that the Federal Government (for purposes of calculating Woolworth\'s federal foreign tax credit pursuant to 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 78, 901(a), and 902(a)) <em>deemed</em> Woolworth to have received from its foreign subsidiaries. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 458 U. S. 359</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On audit, the New Mexico Taxation and Revenue Department determined that, under state law, Woolworth should have included in its apportionable New Mexico income the dividends from its four foreign subsidiaries, the foreign exchange gain, and the $25.5 million gross-up figure.  These additions increased Woolworth\'s apportioned New Mexico income from $84,622 to $401,518.  App. 69a.  The Department denied Woolworth\'s protest, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] but this decision was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="360">Page 458 U. S. 360</a></p><p> reversed on appeal by the New Mexico Court of Appeals.  <em>F. W. Woolworth Co. v. Bureau of Revenue,</em> 95 N.M. 542, 624 P.2d 51 (1979).</p>\n<p>As a matter of state law, the Court of Appeals excluded from apportionable New Mexico income Woolworth\'s receipt of the dividends at issue.  The court stated that</p>\n<p>"[t]here is no indication that the income from Woolworth\'s longstanding investments [in its subsidiaries] was used either in taxpayer\'s unitary domestic business or in its business conducted in New Mexico. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 545, 624 P.2d at 54.  With respect to the gross-up issue, the Court of Appeals said that the State\'s "rigid insistence" on inclusion of this amount "is a refusal to recognize an obviously fictitious income figure, made artificial by the federal reporting requirements for a specific purpose. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 543-544, 624 P.2d at 52-53.  The court said that "<em>[g]ross-up\' in fact represents income to taxpayer\'s foreign subsidiaries [that] is paid out in taxes to foreign governments," <em>id.</em> at 544, 624 P.2d at 53, and not income in fact to the parent.  The court thus likewise excluded this sum from Woolworth\'s apportionable New Mexico income. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>The New Mexico Supreme Court reversed over one dissent.  95 N.M. 519, 624 P.2d 28 (1981).  On the question whether Woolworth\'s receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries constituted apportionable New Mexico income, the court observed that, "[r]egrettably, it needs to be said that the State did a very poor job of inquiring into and developing the facts in this case."  <em>Id.</em> at 524, 624 P.2d at 33.  The court nonetheless found substantial evidence to support the findings that the subsidiaries\' dividend payments met the State\'s statutory test for inclusion in Woolworth\'s apportionable New Mexico income.  On the constitutional issue, the court identified the "key question" after our decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/425/case.html">Mobil Oil</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="361">Page 458 U.

S. 425</a></span> (1980), as "whether those dividends were income earned in a unitary business."  95 N.M. at 528, 624 P.2d at 37.  The court stated:</p>\n<p>"The [dividend] income [from Woolworth\'s subsidiaries] is obviously related to the mutual activities of the parent and its affiliates.  The control over the subsidiaries, the interdependence, the history of the relationships, the placing of the [dividend] money in [Woolworth\'s] general operating account, all point to functional integration and reveal an underlying unitary business for our purposes here."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 529, 624 P.2d at 38.</p>\n<p>Respecting the State\'s inclusion of Woolworth\'s federal gross-up figure as apportionable state income, the court "deem[ed] it unnecessary to delve into all the intricacies of the federal laws and regulations," but found it sufficient</p>\n<p>"to say that, since Woolworth decided to use the gross-up option, the income taxes paid by Woolworth\'s foreign subsidiaries to foreign governments must be deemed to be received as dividends. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 521-522, 624 P.2d at 30-31.</p>\n<p>"Admittedly, the fictitious gross-up, which the state claims is \'business income\' and which Woolworth deliberately acceded to, does not fit the ordinary definition of \'income.\' . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 522, 624 P.2d at 31.  Nevertheless, the court noted that there was no claim and no lower court finding that Woolworth did not "obtain an economic benefit from the gross-up procedure here."  <em>Id.</em> at 523, 624 P.2d at 32.  The court consequently rejected Woolworth\'s statutory and constitutional challenges to the State\'s inclusion of the federal gross-up figure in Woolworth\'s apportionable New Mexico business income.

[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In <em>Mobil,</em> we emphasized, as relevant to the right of a State to tax dividends from foreign subsidiaries, the question whether "contributions to income [of the subsidiaries] result[ed] from functional integration, centralization of management, and economies of scale."  445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/425/case.html#438">445 U.

If such "factors of profitability" arising "from the operation of the business as a whole" exist and evidence the operation of a unitary business, a State can gain a justification for its tax consideration of value that has no other connection with that State.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We turn now to consider the extent, if any, to which these factors exist in this case.</p>\n<p>There was little functional integration.  Woolworth\'s subsidiaries engaged exclusively in the business of retailing -- the purchase of wholesale goods for resale to final consumers.  This type of business differs significantly from the "highly integrated business" of locating, processing, and marketing a resource (such as petroleum) that we previously have found to constitute a unitary business.  <em>Exxon,</em> 447 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/207/case.html#224">447 U.

S. 365</a></p><p> the evidence in this case is that <em>no</em> phase of any subsidiary\'s business was integrated with the parent\'s.  With respect to "who makes the decision for seeing to the merchandise, [store] site selection, advertising and accounting control," the undisputed testimony stated that "[e]ach subsidiary performs these functions autonomously and independently of the parent company."  App. 12a. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  "Each subsidiary has a complete accounting department and a financial staff."  <em>Id.</em> at 14a.  Each had its own outside counsel.   App. to Juris.Statement 34a.  It further appears that Woolworth engaged in no centralized purchasing, manufacturing, or warehousing of merchandise. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The parent had no central personnel training </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 458 U. S. 366</a></p><p> school for its foreign subsidiaries.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And each subsidiary was responsible for obtaining its own financing from sources other than the parent. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In sum, the record is persuasive that Woolworth\'s operations were not functionally integrated with its subsidiaries.</p>\n<p>We now consider the extent to which there was centralization of management or achievement of other economies of scale.  It appears that each subsidiary operated as a distinct business enterprise at the level of full-time management.  With one possible exception, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] none of the subsidiaries\' officers during the year in question was a current or former employee of the parent.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The testimony was that the subsidiaries "figure that their operations are independent, autonomous."  App. 13a.  Woolworth did not "rotate personnel </p><p><a class="page-number" name="367">Page 458 U. S. 367</a></p><p> or train personnel to operate stores in those countries.  There is no exchange of personnel."  <em>Ibid.</em>  There was no "training program that is central to transmit the Woolworth idea of merchandising[,] such as it may be[,] to the foreign subsidiaries."  <em>Id.</em> at 15a.  The subsidiaries</p>\n<p>"proceed . . . with their own programs, either formal or informal.  They develop their own managers and instruct them in their methods of operation."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>This management decentralization was reflected in the fact that each subsidiary possessed autonomy to determine its own policies respecting its primary activity -- retailing.  According to the hearing examiner:</p>\n<p>"Each of the four subsidiaries are responsible for determining the size and location of retail stores, the market conditions in their own territory and the mix of items to be sold.  The German subsidiary emphasizes soft goods such as dresses and coats.  It sells no food.  The English subsidiary operates restaurants in its stores and also operates supermarkets.  Each subsidiary attempts to cater to local tastes and needs.  The inventory of each subsidiary consists, in large part, of home country produced items.  This purchase-at-home practice is consistent with the policy of the taxpayer.  A number of inventory items are purchased from the Orient or other places, but there is no evidence that the subsidiaries purchase, or are required to purchase, inventory items from any particular source."</p>\n<p>App. to Juris.Statement 33a-34a.</p>\n<p>Importantly, the Department\'s hearing examiner found that Woolworth had "no department or section, as such, devoted to overseeing the foreign subsidiary operations."  <em>Id.</em> at 34a. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Neither the parent corporation nor any of the subsidiaries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 458 U. S. 368</a></p><p> consolidates its tax return with any of the other companies.   App. 37a-38a.  The tax manager for Woolworth stated that he did not review the subsidiaries\' tax returns or consult with them on decisions affecting taxes.  <em>Id.</em> at 14a.  There was no "policy of the parent that all of the managers of all the operations get together periodically to discuss the overall Woolworth operations."  <em>Id.</em> at 35a. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>There were some managerial links.  Woolworth maintained one or several common directors with some of the subsidiaries. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  There also was irregular in-person [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] and "frequent" mail, telephone, and teletype communication between the upper echelons of management of the parent and the subsidiaries.

[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 35a.  Woolworth\'s published financial statements, such as its annual reports, were prepared on a consolidated basis. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>We conclude, on the basis of undisputed facts, that the four subsidiaries in question are not a part of a unitary business under the principles articulated in <em>Mobil</em> and <em>Exxon,</em> and today reiterated in <em>ASARCO.</em>  Except for the type of occasional oversight -- with respect to capital structure, major debt, and dividends -- that any parent gives to an investment in a subsidiary, there is little or no integration of the business activities or centralization of the management of these five corporations.

[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  In operations of this character, there is a flow of international trade, often an interchange of personnel, and substantial mutual interdependence.  The uncontradicted evidence demonstrates that Woolworth\'s international retail business is not comparable.  There is no flow of international business.  Nor is there any integration or unitary operation in the sense in which our cases consistently have used these terms.</p>\n<p>In <em>Mobil,</em> we recognized:</p>\n<p>"[A]ll dividend income received by corporations operating in interstate commerce is [not] necessarily taxable in each State where that corporation does business.

But he affirmed his knowledge that the English company\'s sales to and purchases from the parent were "virtually nil."  <em>Id.</em> at 44a.  When questioned whether Woolworth utilized a central buying office for it and its subsidiaries, the witness replied that it did not.  <em>Id.</em> at 14a.  No other evidence indicated that the parent and the subsidiaries engaged in any joint manufacturing, purchasing, or warehousing functions.  Nor did the New Mexico courts find otherwise.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Woolworth had no outstanding debts from its English subsidiary, App. to Juris.Statement 35a, and it had not reinvested its dividends in that company.  App. 51a.  The parent had reinvested dividends in the German company, <em>id.</em> at 52a, but the last additional capital contribution by the parent that the witness could recall, <em>id.</em> at 46a, was a $400,000 transfer made after the German company was demolished during World War II.  <em>Id.</em> at 30a.  <em>See</em> App. to Juris.Statement 35a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>The hearing examiner found that "[i]n the taxable year involved, none of the four subsidiarie[s\'] officers were currently or formerly employees of the parent."  <em>Id.</em> at 34a.  Without explanation, he also later stated that "[a]t least one officer of the Canadian subsidiary [was] also an officer of the [parent]."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>One officer from the Mexican subsidiary was a participant in Woolworth\'s profit-sharing plan.  Woolworth paid the employee\'s share of this plan.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Woolworth had one vice-president "who is the liaison man with the smaller foreign subsidiaries," <em>ibid.,</em> such as the Spanish and Mexican subsidiaries.  App. 50a.  The testimony was that this liaison man "from time to time . . . may have contact with the major subsidiaries. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>The witness replied that "[t]here hasn\'t been that" in response to the questions of whether "all of the managers of all of the operations" ever</p>\n<p>"get together and talk together about where the company is going or what it is doing or where it should be tomorrow or in ten years from today?  Planning for future programs or for future expansion?"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 35a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>The managing director of the English subsidiary sat as one of the parent\'s 15 directors, and the parent sent one of its officers to participate in meetings of the English board of directors.  The state hearing examiner also found that "[a]t least one person who is on the Canadian subsidiary is also on the taxpayer\'s board."  App. to Juris.Statement 34a.  <em>Cf.</em> App. 41a (at least three members of the Canadian board of directors also sat on the parent\'s board).  Although the Department\'s hearing examiner did not make findings in this connection, there was testimony that "some of the directors of Woolworth, the taxpayer, sit on the Board of the Mexican subsidiary. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at 29a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>"It would be on a rare occasion, once a year," that the "managing directors" of the foreign subsidiaries would come to New York.  <em>Id.</em> at 34a.  "It is only sporadically that the parent company is represented at the [English company\'s] Board meetings."  <em>Id.</em> at 40a.  Further, while Woolworth\'s chief executive officer and other officers would "on occasion" travel to confer with the subsidiaries\' managers, it was "hard to discern any pattern of regular monthly visits or quarterly visits."  <em>Id.</em> at 35a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>"The exchange of information contacts by the subsidiaries is made by the Chief Executive of the company.  The Director of Purchases of the parent company does not confer with the Director of Purchasing of the Canadian company or of the German company."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 37a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The testimony was that</p>\n<p>"the Canadian financial people have the right to finance their day-to-day operations, and I doubt that they would be required . . . at the level of a million dollars to seek the permission of the parent company.  If there was really substantial borrowings going on, I am sure the Canadians, before borrowing, . . . would obtain permission of the parent company."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 26a.  More generally, the witness stated that</p>\n<p>"[n]ormally, I would think that substantial borrowing, an unusual amount, would necessitate the checking with the principal stockholders or the Board of Directors."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 28a.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>The English subsidiary was not included in the consolidated statements.  App. to Juris.Statement 35a.  <em>Cf.</em> Keesling &amp; Warren, The Unitary Concept in the Allocation of Income, 12 Hastings L.J. 42, 52 (1960) ("Central accounting, for instance, may result in some savings, but in most instances the amount is trifling in comparison with the income [involved].  Alone considered, it is too weak a connecting link to bind into one business, what would otherwise, from an operational standpoint, be considered separate businesses").</p>\n<p>As noted, there was no centralized tax department and no consolidation of tax returns.</p>\n<p>In addition to the links set forth in the text, it is plain that the parent and the four subsidiaries all utilize the same general "F. W. Woolworth" corporate name.  There is no record information on the significance of the use of this common name.  Neither the Department nor the New Mexico Supreme Court gave any weight to use of a common corporate name when sustaining the tax at issue.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf.

Woolworth Co. wholly owned its German, Canadian, and Mexican subsidiaries, and had a 52.7% interest in its English subsidiary.
