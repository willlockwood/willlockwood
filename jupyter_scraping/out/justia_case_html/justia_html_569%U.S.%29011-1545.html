Relying on its broad authority to implement the Communications Act, see \n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) issued a Declaratory Ruling concluding that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9creasonable period of time\xe2\x80\x9d is presumptively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower and 150 days to process all other applications.  The cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, sought review of the Declaratory Ruling in the Fifth Circuit.  They argued that the Commission lacked authority to interpret \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)\xe2\x80\x99s limitations.  The Court of Appeals, relying on Circuit precedent holding that Chevron U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. v.

There is no distinction between an agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations.  The \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional-nonjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d line is meaningful in the judicial context because Congress has the power to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide\xe2\x80\x94that is, to define their jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94but not to prescribe how they decide those cases.  But for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes, both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.  Because the question is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for carving out an arbitrary subset of \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d questions from the Chevron framework.

These cases have nothing to do with federalism: The statute explicitly supplants state authority, so the question is simply whether a federal agency or federal courts will draw the lines to which the States must hew.

Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n, requires that, for Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted.  But Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency with rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking.  There is no case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency\xe2\x80\x99s substantive field.  A general conferral of rulemaking authority validates rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.  It suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.

In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \xe2\x80\x9cimpose[d] specific limitations on the traditional authority of state and local governments to regulate the location, construction, and modification of such facilities,\xe2\x80\x9d Rancho Palos Verdes v. Abrams, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113, \n115 (2005)\n, and incorporated those limitations into the Communications Act of 1934, see \n\n110Stat.\n56,\n151.  Section 201(b) of that Act empowers the Federal Communications Commission to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe such rules and regulations as may be necessary in the public interest to carry out [its] provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ch. 296, \n\n52Stat.\n588, codified at \n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b).  Of course, that rulemaking authority extends to the subsequently added portions of the Act.  See AT&amp;T Corp. v.

That provision requires state or local governments to act on wireless siting applications \xe2\x80\x9cwithin a reasonable period of time after the request is duly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two other features of \xc2\xa7332(c)(7) are relevant.  First, subparagraph (A), known as the \xe2\x80\x9csaving clause,\xe2\x80\x9d provides that nothing in the Act, except those limitations provided in \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B), \xe2\x80\x9cshall limit or affect the authority of a State or local government\xe2\x80\x9d over siting decisions.  Second, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v) authorizes a person who believes a state or local government\xe2\x80\x99s wireless-siting decision to be inconsistent with any of the limitations in \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B) to \xe2\x80\x9ccommence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn theory, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) requires state and local  zoning authorities to take prompt action on siting applications for wireless facilities.  But in practice, wireless providers often faced long delays.  In July 2008, CTIA\xe2\x80\x94The Wireless Association,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t which represents wireless service providers, petitioned the FCC to clarify the meaning of \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that zoning authorities act on siting requests \xe2\x80\x9cwithin a reasonable period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  In November 2009, the Commission, relying on its broad statutory authority to implement the provisions of the Communications Act, issued a declaratory ruling responding to CTIA\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  In\xc2\xa0re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994, 14001.  The Commission found that the \xe2\x80\x9crecord evidence demonstrates that unreasonable delays in the personal wireless service facility siting process have obstructed the provision of wireless services\xe2\x80\x9d and that such delays \xe2\x80\x9cimpede the promotion of ad- vanced services and competition that Congress deemed critical in the Telecommunications Act of 1996.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 14006, 14008.  A \xe2\x80\x9creasonable period of time\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii), the Commission determined, is presumptively (but rebuttably) 90 days to process a collocation application (that is, an application to place a new antenna on an existing tower) and 150 days to process all other applications.

Specifically, they argued that the saving clause, \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(A), and the judicial review provision, \xc2\xa7337(c)(7)(B)(v), together display a congressional intent to withhold from the Commission authority to interpret the limitations in \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B).  Asserting that ground of objection, the cities of Arlington and San Antonio, Texas, petitioned for review of the Declaratory Ruling in the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRelying on Circuit precedent, the Court of Appeals held that the Chevron framework applied to the threshold question whether the FCC possessed statutory authority to adopt the 90- and 150-day timeframes.  668 F.\xc2\xa03d 229, 248 (CA5 2012) (citing Texas v. United States, 497 F.\xc2\xa03d 491, 501 (CA5 2007)).

Id., at 254.

First, applying the ordinary tools of statutory construction, the court must determine \xe2\x80\x9cwhether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.  If the intent of Congress is clear, that is the end of the matter; for the court, as well as the agency, must give effect to the unambiguously expressed intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  But \xe2\x80\x9cif the statute is silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, the question for the court is whether the agency\xe2\x80\x99s answer is based on a permissible construction of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 843.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tChevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional intent: namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Congress, when it left ambiguity in a statute\xe2\x80\x9d administered by an agency, \xe2\x80\x9cunderstood that the ambiguity would be resolved, first and foremost, by the agency, and desired the agency (rather than the courts) to possess whatever degree of discretion the ambiguity allows.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smiley v. Citibank (South Dakota), N.\xc2\xa0A., \n\n517 U.\xc2\xa0S. 735\n\xe2\x80\x93741 (1996).  Chevron thus provides a stable background rule against which Congress can legislate: Statutory ambiguities will be resolved, within the bounds of reasonable interpretation, not by the courts but by the administering agency.

The argument against deference rests on the premise that there exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations: Some interpretations\xe2\x80\x94the big, important ones, presumably\xe2\x80\x94define the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Others\xe2\x80\x94humdrum, run-of-the-mill stuff\xe2\x80\x94are simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.  That premise is false, because the distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations is a mirage.  No matter how it is framed, the question  a court faces when confronted with an agency\xe2\x80\x99s inter- pretation of a statute it administers is always, simply, whether the agency has stayed within the bounds of its statutory authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe misconception that there are, for Chevron purposes, separate \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d questions on which no deference is due derives, perhaps, from a reflexive extension to agen- cies of the very real division between the jurisdictional and nonjurisdictional that is applicable to courts.  In the judicial context, there is a meaningful line: Whether the court decided correctly is a question that has different consequences from the question whether it had the power to decide at all.  Congress has the power (within limits) to tell the courts what classes of cases they may decide, see Trainmen v. Toledo, P. &amp; W. R. Co., \n\n321 U.\xc2\xa0S. 50\n\xe2\x80\x9364 (1944); Lauf v. E. G. Shinner &amp; Co., \n\n303 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323, \n330 (1938)\n, but not to prescribe or superintend how they decide those cases, see Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 211\n\xe2\x80\x93219 (1995).  A court\xe2\x80\x99s power to decide a case is independent of whether its decision is correct, which is why even an erroneous judgment is entitled to res judicata effect.  Put differently, a jurisdictionally proper but substantively incorrect judicial decision is not ultra vires.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is not so for agencies charged with administering congressional statutes.  Both their power to act and how they are to act is authoritatively prescribed by Congress, so that when they act improperly, no less than when they act beyond their jurisdiction, what they do is ultra vires.  Because the question\xe2\x80\x94whether framed as an incorrect application of agency authority or an assertion of author- ity not conferred\xe2\x80\x94is always whether the agency has gone beyond what Congress has permitted it to do, there is no principled basis for carving out some arbitrary subset of such claims as \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn example will illustrate just how illusory the pro- posed line between \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnonjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d agency interpretations is.  Imagine the following validly-enacted statute:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\n\t\t\t\tCommon Carrier Act\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\n\t\t\t\tSection 1.  The Agency shall have jurisdiction to prohibit any common carrier from imposing an unreasonable condition upon access to its facilities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThere is no question that this provision\xe2\x80\x94including the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccommon carrier\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable condition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94defines the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Surely, the argument goes, a court must determine de\xc2\xa0novo the scope of that jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider, however, this alternative formulation of the statute:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\n\t\t\t\tCommon Carrier Act\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\tSection 1.  No common carrier shall impose an unreasonable condition upon access to its facilities.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\n\t\t\t\tSection 2.  The Agency may prescribe rules and regulations necessary in the public interest to effectuate Section 1 of this Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tNow imagine that the Agency, invoking its Section 2 authority, promulgates this Rule: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) The term \xe2\x80\x98common carrier\xe2\x80\x99 in Section 1 includes Internet Service Providers.  (2) The term \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable condition\xe2\x80\x99 in Section 1 includes unreasonably high prices.  (3) A monthly fee greater than $25 is an unreasonable condition on access to Internet service.\xe2\x80\x9d  By this Rule, the Agency has claimed for itself jurisdiction that is doubly questionable: Does its authority extend to Internet Service Providers?  And does it extend to setting prices?  Yet Section 2 makes clear that Congress, in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 words, \xe2\x80\x9cconferred interpretive power on the agency\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to Section 1.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p. 14.  Even under petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 theory, then, a court should defer to the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccommon carrier\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable condition\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is to say, its assertion that its \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d extends to regulating Internet Service Providers and setting prices.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the first case, by contrast, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 theory would accord the agency no deference.  The trouble with this is that in both cases, the underlying question is exactly the same: Does the statute give the agency authority to regulate Internet Service Providers and cap prices, or not?\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The reality, laid bare, is that there is no difference, insofar as the validity of agency action is concerned, between an agency\xe2\x80\x99s exceeding the scope of its authority (its \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d) and its exceeding authorized application of authority that it unquestionably has.  \xe2\x80\x9cTo exceed authorized application is to exceed authority.  Virtually any administrative action can be characterized as either the one or the other, depending on how generally one wishes to describe the \xe2\x80\x98authority.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Mississippi Power &amp; Light Co. v.

Gulf Power Co., \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327 (2002)\n.  That case considered whether the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d to regulate the rents utility-pole owners charge for \xe2\x80\x9cpole attachments\xe2\x80\x9d (defined as attachments by a cable television system or provider of telecommunications service) extended to attachments that provided both cable television and high-speed Internet access (attachments for so-called \xe2\x80\x9ccommingled services\xe2\x80\x9d).  Id., at 331\xe2\x80\x93336.  We held, sensibly, that Chevron applied.  534 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 333, 339.  Whether framed as going to the scope of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s delegated authority or the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s application of its delegated authority, the underlying question was the same: Did the FCC exceed the bounds of its statutory authority to regulate rents for \xe2\x80\x9cpole attachments\xe2\x80\x9d when it sought to regulate rents for pole attachments providing commingled services?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe label is an empty distraction because every new application of a broad statutory term can be reframed as a questionable extension of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  One of the briefs in support of petitioners explains, helpfully, that \xe2\x80\x9c[j]urisdictional questions concern the who, what, where, and when of regulatory power: which subject matters may an agency regulate and under what conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for IMLA Respondents 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  But an agency\xe2\x80\x99s application of its authority pursuant to statutory text answers the same questions.  Who is an \xe2\x80\x9coutside salesman\xe2\x80\x9d?  What is a \xe2\x80\x9cpole attachment\xe2\x80\x9d?  Where do the \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d end?  When must a Medicare provider challenge a reimbursement determination in order to be entitled to an administrative appeal?  These can all be reframed as questions about the scope of agencies\xe2\x80\x99 regulatory jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x94 and they are all questions to which the Chevron  framework applies.

See H. Edwards &amp; L. Elliott, Federal Standards of Review 146 (2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cIn practice, it does not appear to matter whether delegated authority  is viewed as a threshold inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d).

One of our opinions explicitly says that no \xe2\x80\x9cexception exists to the normal [deferential] standard of review\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98jurisdictional or legal question[s] concerning the coverage\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of an Act.  NLRB v. City Disposal Systems, Inc., \n\n465 U.\xc2\xa0S. 822, \n830, n. \n7 (1984)\n.  A prime example of deferential review for questions of jurisdiction is Commodity Futures Trading Comm\xe2\x80\x99n v. Schor, \n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833 (1986)\n.  That case involved a CFTC interpretation of \n\n7 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa718(c), which provides that before the Commission takes action on a complaint, the complainant must file a bond to cover \xe2\x80\x9cany reparation award that may be issued by the Commission against the complainant on any counterclaim by respondent.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)

For instance, in Chemical Mfrs. Assn. v.

Reports are shot through with applications of Chevron to agencies\xe2\x80\x99 constructions of the scope of their own jurisdiction.  And we have applied Chevron where concerns about agency self-aggrandizement are at their apogee: in cases where an agency\xe2\x80\x99s expansive construction of the extent of its own power would have wrought a fundamental change in the regulatory scheme.  In FDA v.

Like the Hound of the Baskervilles, it is conjured by those with greater quarry in sight: Make no mistake\xe2\x80\x94the ultimate target here is Chevron itself.  Savvy challengers of agency action would play the \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d card in every case.  See, e.g., Cellco Partnership v. FCC, 700 F.\xc2\xa03d 534,  541 (CADC 2012).

Mead Corp., \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218 (2001)\n, requires that, for Chevron deference to apply, the agency must have received congressional authority to determine the particular matter at issue in the particular manner adopted.  No one disputes that.   But Mead denied Chevron deference to action, by an agency  with rulemaking authority, that was not rulemaking.  What the dissent needs, and fails to produce, is a single case in which a general conferral of rulemaking or adjudicative authority has been held insufficient to support Chevron deference for an exercise of that authority within the agency\xe2\x80\x99s substantive field.  There is no such case, and what the dissent proposes is a massive revision of our Chevron jurisprudence.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhere we differ from the dissent is in its apparent rejection of the theorem that the whole includes all of its parts\xe2\x80\x94its view that a general conferral of rulemaking authority does not validate rules for all the matters the agency is charged with administering.  Rather, the dissent proposes that even when general rulemaking authority is clear, every agency rule must be subjected to a de\xc2\xa0novo judicial determination of whether the particular issue was committed to agency discretion.  It offers no standards at all to guide this open-ended hunt for congressional intent (that is to say, for evidence of congressional intent more specific than the conferral of general rulemaking author- ity).  It would simply punt that question back to the Court of Appeals, presumably for application of some sort of totality-of-the-circumstances test\xe2\x80\x94which is really, of course, not a test at all but an invitation to make an ad\xc2\xa0hoc judgment regarding congressional intent.  Thirteen Courts of Appeals applying a totality-of-the-circumstances test would render the binding effect of agency rules unpredictable and destroy the whole stabilizing purpose of Chevron.  The excessive agency power that the dissent fears would be replaced by chaos.  There is no need to wade into these murky waters.  It suffices to decide this case that the preconditions to deference under Chevron are satisfied because Congress has unambiguously vested the FCC with general authority to administer the Communications Act through rulemaking and adjudication, and the agency interpretation at issue was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThose who assert that applying Chevron to \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations \xe2\x80\x9cleaves the fox in charge of the henhouse\xe2\x80\x9d overlook the reality that a separate category of \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdictional\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations does not exist.  The fox-in-the-henhouse syndrome is to be avoided not by estab- lishing an arbitrary and undefinable category of agency decisionmaking that is accorded no deference, but by taking  seriously, and applying rigorously, in all cases, statutory limits on agencies\xe2\x80\x99 authority.  Where Congress has established a clear line, the agency cannot go beyond it; and where Congress has established an ambiguous line, the agency can go no further than the ambiguity will fairly allow.

Second, a judicial review provision, says: \xe2\x80\x9cAny person adversely affected by any final action or failure to act by a State or local government or any instrumentality thereof that is inconsistent with this subparagraph may, within 30 days after such action or failure to act, commence an action in any court of competent jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(v).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, however, these two provisions cannot provide good reason for reaching the conclusion advocated by petitioners. The first provision begins with an exception, stating that it does not apply to (among other things) the \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d provision here at issue.  The second sim- ply sets forth a procedure for judicial review, a review that applies to most government actions. Both are consistent with a statutory scheme that gives States, localities, the FCC, and reviewing courts each some role to play in the location of wireless service facilities.  And neither \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly describ[es] an exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s plenary authority to interpret the Act.  American Hospital Assn. v.

The Court of Appeals ultimately reached the same conclusion (though for somewhat dif- ferent reasons), and the majority affirms the lower court.

Courts defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of law when and because Congress has conferred on the agency interpretive authority over the question at issue.

Although modern administrative agencies fit most comfortably within the Executive Branch, as a practical matter they exercise legislative power, by promulgating regulations with the force of law; executive power, by policing compliance with those regulations; and judicial power, by adjudicating enforcement actions and imposing sanctions on those found to have violated their rules.  The accumulation of these powers in the same hands is not an occasional or isolated exception to the constitutional plan; it is a central feature of modern American government.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe administrative state \xe2\x80\x9cwields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life.\xe2\x80\x9d  Free Enterprise Fund v.

The collection of agencies housed outside the traditional executive departments, including the Federal Communications Commission, is routinely described as the \xe2\x80\x9cheadless fourth branch of government,\xe2\x80\x9d reflecting not only the scope of their authority but their practical independence.

That is fine\xe2\x80\x94until the parenthetical.  The parties, amici, and court below too often use the term \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d imprecisely, which leads the Court to misunderstand the argument it must confront.  That argument is not that \xe2\x80\x9cthere exist two distinct classes of agency interpretations,\xe2\x80\x9d some \xe2\x80\x9cbig, important ones\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cdefine the agency\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98jurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and other \xe2\x80\x9chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\xe2\x80\x9d ones that \xe2\x80\x9care simply applications of jurisdiction the agency plainly has.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Barrett, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 638 (1990)\n.  In that case, the Department of Labor contended the Court should defer to its interpretation of the scope of the private right of action provided by the Migrant and Seasonal Agriculture Worker Protection Act (AWPA), \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71854, against employers who intentionally violated the Act\xe2\x80\x99s motor vehicle safety provisions.  We refused to do so.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cas an initial matter\xe2\x80\x9d we rejected the idea that Congress left a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory \xe2\x80\x98gap\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for the agency to fill, we reasoned that if the \xe2\x80\x9cAWPA\xe2\x80\x99s language establishing a private right of action is ambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d the Secretary of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of its scope did not warrant Chevron deference.  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 649.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn language directly applicable to the question before us, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] precondition to deference under Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Although \xe2\x80\x9cCongress clearly envisioned, indeed expressly mandated, a role for the Department of Labor in administering the statute by requiring the Secretary to promulgate standards implementing AWPA\xe2\x80\x99s motor vehicle provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d we found \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o such delegation regarding AWPA\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 650 (emphasis added).  It would therefore be \xe2\x80\x9cinappropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9cto consult executive interpretations\xe2\x80\x9d of the enforcement provisions to resolve ambiguities \xe2\x80\x9csurrounding the scope of AWPA\xe2\x80\x99s judicially enforceable remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Without questioning the principle that agency determinations \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of delegated authority are entitled to deference,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained that \xe2\x80\x9cit is fundamental \xe2\x80\x98that an agency may not bootstrap itself into an area in which it has no jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

In United States v. Mead Corp., supra, for example, Chevron deference turned on whether Congress had delegated to the agency authority to interpret the statutory ambiguity by a particular means.  The Customs Service had issued a \xe2\x80\x9cclassification ruling,\xe2\x80\x9d interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9cdiaries\xe2\x80\x9d in a tariff schedule to include \xe2\x80\x9cday planners\xe2\x80\x9d of the type Mead imported, and on that basis subjected the planners to a four-percent tariff.  Mead protested the imposition of the tariff, the Customs Service claimed Chevron deference for its interpretation, and the controversy made its way to our Court.  Id., at 224\xe2\x80\x93226.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Mead, we again made clear that the \xe2\x80\x9ccategory of interpretative choices\xe2\x80\x9d to which Chevron deference applies is defined by congressional intent.  Id., at 229.  Chevron deference, we said, rests on a recognition that Congress has delegated to an agency the interpretive authority to implement \xe2\x80\x9ca particular provision\xe2\x80\x9d or answer \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a particular question.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Chevron, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 844).  An agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9ca particular statutory provision\xe2\x80\x9d thus qualifies for Chevron deference only \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was pro-mulgated in the exercise of that authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226\xe2\x80\x93227.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court did not defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s views but instead determined that Congress had not delegated interpretive authority to the Customs Service to definitively construe the tariff schedule through classification rulings.  Neither the statutory authorization for the classification rulings, nor the Customs Service\xe2\x80\x99s practice in issuing such rulings, \xe2\x80\x9creasonably suggest[ed] that Congress ever thought of [such] classification rulings as deserving the deference claimed for them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 231.  And in the absence of such a delegation, we concluded the interpretations adopted in those rulings were \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the Chevron pale.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 234.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGonzales v. Oregon, \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 243 (2006)\n, is in the same line of precedent.  In that case, as here, deference turned on whether a congressional delegation of interpretive authority reached a particular statutory ambiguity.  The Attorney General claimed Chevron deference for his interpretation of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d in the Controlled Substances Act (CSA) to exclude the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances for the purpose of assisting suicide.  Id., at 254, 258.  No one disputed that \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous in the relevant sense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 258.  Nor did any Justice dispute that the Attorney General had been granted the power in the CSA to promulgate rules with the force of law.  Ibid.; see id., at 281 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Nevertheless, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cChevron deference .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not accorded merely because the statute is ambiguous and an administrative official is involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 258.  The regulation advancing the interpretation, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cmust be promulgated pursuant to authority Congress has delegated to the official.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (citing Mead, supra, at 226\xe2\x80\x93227).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the CSA, Congress delegated to the Attorney General the authority to promulgate regulations \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the registration and control of the manufacture, distribution, and dispensing of controlled substances,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7821, or \xe2\x80\x9cfor the efficient execution of his functions under [the CSA],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7871(b).  After considering the text, structure, and purpose of the Act, the Court concluded on its own that interpreting \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x9d fell under neither delegation.  Gonzales, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258\xe2\x80\x93269.  Because the regulation \xe2\x80\x9cwas not promulgated pursuant to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority, its interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98legitimate medical purpose\xe2\x80\x99 d[id] not receive Chevron deference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 268.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAdams Fruit, Mead, and Gonzales thus confirm that Chevron deference is based on, and finds legitimacy as, a congressional delegation of interpretive authority.  An agency interpretation warrants such deference only if Congress has delegated authority to definitively interpret a particular ambiguity in a particular manner.  Whether Congress has done so must be determined by the court on its own before Chevron can apply.  See H. Edwards, L. Elliot, &amp; M. Levy, Federal Courts Standards of Review 168 (2d ed. 2013) (\xe2\x80\x9ca court decides de\xc2\xa0novo whether an agency has acted within the bounds of congressionally delegated authority\xe2\x80\x9d (citing Mead, supra, at 226\xe2\x80\x93227, and Gonzales, supra, at 258)); Sales &amp; Adler, The Rest is Silence: Chevron Deference, Agency Jurisdiction, and Statutory Silences, 2009 U. Ill. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1497, 1564 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cif delegation really is antecedent to deference, as Mead insists, it cannot be that courts should defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s views on whether a delegation has taken place\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn other words, we do not defer to an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of an ambiguous provision unless Congress wants us to, and whether Congress wants us to is a question that courts, not agencies, must decide.

Chevron deference then applies, it contends, to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of any ambiguity in the Act, including ambiguity in a provision said to carve out specific provisions from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s general rulemaking authority.  If Congress intends to exempt part of the statute from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive authority, the FCC says, Congress \xe2\x80\x9ccan ordinarily be expected to state that intent explicitly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondents 30 (citing American Hospital Assn. v.

The appropriate question is whether the delegation covers the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific provision\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cparticular question\xe2\x80\x9d before the court.  Chevron, 467 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 844.  A congressional grant of authority over some portion of a statute does not necessarily mean that Congress granted the agency interpretive authority over all its provisions.  See Adams Fruit, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 650.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn example that might highlight the point concerns statutes that parcel out authority to multiple agencies, which \xe2\x80\x9cmay be the norm, rather than an exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gersen, Overlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in Administrative Law, 2006 S. Ct. Rev. 201, 208; see, e.g., Gonzales, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S, at 250\xe2\x80\x93251 (describing shared author-ity over the CSA between the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services); Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., \n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 471, \n478 (1999)\n (authority to issue regulations implementing the Americans with Disabilities Act \xe2\x80\x9cis split primarily among three Government agencies\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, for example, authorizes rulemaking by at least eight different agencies.  See Con-gressional Research Service, C. Copeland, Rulemaking Requirements and Authorities in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act 7 (2010).  When presented with an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of such a statute, a court cannot simply ask whether the statute is one that the agency administers; the question is whether authority over the particular ambiguity at issue has been delegated to the particular agency.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy the same logic, even when Congress provides interpretive authority to a single agency, a court must decide if the ambiguity the agency has purported to interpret with the force of law is one to which the congressional delegation extends.  A general delegation to the agency to administer the statute will often suffice to satisfy the court that Congress has delegated interpretive authority over the ambiguity at issue.  But if Congress has exempted particular provisions from that authority, that exemption must be respected, and the determination whether Congress has done so is for the courts alone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FCC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Congress \xe2\x80\x9ccan ordinarily be expected to state that intent explicitly,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Federal Respondents 30 (citing American Hospital, supra), goes to the merits of that determination, not to whether a court should decide the question de\xc2\xa0novo or defer to the agency.  Indeed, that is how the Court in American Hospital considered it.  It was in the process of \xe2\x80\x9cemploying the traditional tools of statutory construction\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court said it would have expected Congress to speak more clearly if it had intended to exclude an entire subject area\xe2\x80\x94employee units for collecting bargaining\xe2\x80\x94from the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s general rulemaking authority.  Id., at 613, 614.  The Court concluded, after considering the language, structure, policy, and legislative history of the Act on its own\xe2\x80\x94without deferring to the agency\xe2\x80\x94that the meaning of the statute was \xe2\x80\x9cclear and contrary to the meaning advanced by petitioner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 609\xe2\x80\x93614.  To be sure, the Court also noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven if we could find any ambiguity in [the provision] after employing the traditional tools of statutory construction, we would still defer to Board\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 614 (emphasis added).  But that single sentence of dictum cannot carry the day for the FCC here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the preceding analysis makes clear, I do not understand petitioners to ask the Court\xe2\x80\x94nor do I think it necessary\xe2\x80\x94to draw a \xe2\x80\x9cspecious, but scary-sounding\xe2\x80\x9d line between \xe2\x80\x9cbig, important\xe2\x80\x9d interpretations on the one hand and \xe2\x80\x9chumdrum, run-of-the-mill\xe2\x80\x9d ones on the other.  Ante, at 5, 12.  Drawing such a line may well be difficult.  Distinguishing between whether an agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of an ambiguous term is reasonable and whether that term is for the agency to interpret is not nearly so difficult.  It certainly did not confuse the FCC in this proceeding.  Compare In\xc2\xa0re Petition for Declaratory Ruling, 24 FCC Rcd. 13994, 14000\xe2\x80\x9314003 (2009) (addressing the latter question), with id., at 14003\xe2\x80\x9314015 (addressing the former).

Ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x938.  The major-ity states that in its second Common Carrier Act, Section 2 makes clear that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conferred interpretative power on the agency\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to interpret the ambiguous terms \xe2\x80\x9ccommon carrier\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7 (quoting Brief for Petitioners in No. 1545, p.\xc2\xa014).  Thus, it says, under anyone\xe2\x80\x99s theory a court must defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretations of those terms.  Correct.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority claims, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioners\xe2\x80\x99 theory would accord the agency no deference\xe2\x80\x9d in its interpretation of the same ambiguous terms in the first Common Carrier Act.  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  But as I understand petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument\xe2\x80\x94and certainly in my own view\xe2\x80\x94a court, in both cases, need only decide for itself whether Congress has delegated to the agency authority to interpret the ambiguous terms, before affording the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation Chevron deference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the second Common Carrier Act, the answer is easy.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical Congress has spoken clearly and specifically in Section 2 of the Act about its delegation of authority to interpret Section 1.  As for the first Act, it is harder to analyze the question, given only one section of a presumably much larger statute.  But if the first Common Carrier Act is like most agencies\xe2\x80\x99 organic statutes, I have no reason to doubt that the agency would likewise have interpretive authority over the same ambiguous terms, and therefore be entitled to deference in con-struing them, just as with the second Common Carrier Act.  There is no new \xe2\x80\x9ctest\xe2\x80\x9d to worry about, cf. ante, at 16; courts would simply apply the normal rules of statutory construction.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat the question might be harder with respect to the first Common Carrier Act should come as no surprise.  The second hypothetical Congress has more carefully defined the agency\xe2\x80\x99s authority than the first.  Whatever standard of review applies, it is more difficult to interpret an unclear statute than a clear one.  My point is simply that before a court can defer to the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the ambiguous terms in either Act, it must determine for itself that Congress has delegated authority to the agency to issue those interpretations with the force of law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority also expresses concern that adopting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 position would undermine Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s stable background rule against which Congress legislates.

That is the obligation of the Judiciary not only to confine itself to its proper role, but to ensure that the other branches do so as well.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive authority, entitling the agency to judicial deference, acquires its legitimacy from a delegation of lawmaking power from Congress to the Executive.  Our duty to police the boundary between the Legislature and the Executive is as critical as our duty to respect that between the Judiciary and the Executive.  See Zivotofsky v. Clinton, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 8).  In the present context, that means ensuring that the Legislative Branch has in fact delegated lawmaking power to an agency within the Executive Branch, before the Judiciary defers to the Executive on what the law is.  That concern is heightened, not diminished, by the fact that the administrative agencies, as a practical matter, draw upon a potent brew of executive, legislative, and judicial power.  And it is heightened, not diminished, by the dramatic shift in power over the last 50 years from Congress to the Executive\xe2\x80\x94a shift effected through the administrative agencies.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe reconcile our competing responsibilities in this area by ensuring judicial deference to agency interpretations under Chevron\xe2\x80\x94but only after we have determined on our own that Congress has given interpretive authority to the agency.  Our \xe2\x80\x9ctask is to fix the boundaries of delegated authority,\xe2\x80\x9d Monaghan, 83 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 27; that is not a task we can delegate to the agency.  We do not leave it to the agency to decide when it is in charge.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn these cases, the FCC issued a declaratory ruling interpreting the term \xe2\x80\x9creasonable period of time\xe2\x80\x9d in \n\n47 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii).  The Fifth Circuit correctly recognized that it could not apply Chevron deference to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation unless the agency \xe2\x80\x9cpossessed statutory authority to administer \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii),\xe2\x80\x9d but it erred by granting Chevron deference to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s view on that antecedent question.  See 668 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 248.  Because the court should have determined on its own whether Congress delegated interpretive authority over \xc2\xa7332(c)(7)(B)(ii) to the FCC before affording Chevron deference, I would vacate the decision below and remand the cases to the Fifth Circuit to perform the proper inquiry in the first instance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
