The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s fleet faces a significant threat from modern diesel-electric submarines, which are extremely difficult to detect and track because they can operate almost silently.  The most effective tool for identifying submerged diesel-electric submarines is active sonar, which emits pulses of sound underwater and then receives the acoustic waves that echo off the target.  Active sonar is a complex technology, and sonar operators must undergo extensive training to become proficient in its use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cmid-frequency active\xe2\x80\x9d (MFA) sonar during integrated training exercises in the waters off southern California (SOCAL).  In these exercises, ships, submarines, and aircraft train together as members of a \xe2\x80\x9cstrike group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Due to the importance of antisubmarine warfare, a strike group may not be certified for deployment until it demonstrates proficiency in the use of active sonar to detect, track, and neutralize enemy submarines.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The SOCAL waters contain at least 37 species of marine mammals.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x94groups and individuals devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitats\xe2\x80\x94assert that MFA sonar causes serious injuries to these animals.  The Navy disputes that claim, noting that MFA sonar training in SOCAL waters has been conducted for 40 years without a single documented sonar-related injury to any marine mammal.  Plaintiffs sued the Navy, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief on the grounds that the training exercises violated the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and other federal laws; in particular, plaintiffs contend that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement (EIS) before conducting the latest round of SOCAL exercises.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting the Navy from using MFA sonar during its training exercises.  The Court of Appeals held that this injunction was overbroad and remanded to the District Court for a narrower remedy.  The District Court then entered another preliminary injunction, imposing six restrictions on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s use of sonar during its SOCAL training exercises.  As relevant to this case, the injunction required the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal was spotted within 2,200 yards of a vessel, and to power down sonar by 6 decibels during conditions known as \xe2\x80\x9csurface ducting.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy then sought relief from the Executive Branch.  The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) authorized the Navy to implement \xe2\x80\x9calternative arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d to NEPA compliance in light of \xe2\x80\x9cemergency circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  The CEQ allowed the Navy to continue its training exercises under voluntary mitigation procedures that the Navy had previously adopted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy moved to vacate the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary injunction in light of the CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  The District Court refused to do so, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  The Court of Appeals held that there was a serious question whether the CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cemergency circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d regulation was lawful, that plaintiffs had carried their burden of establishing a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d of irreparable injury, and that the preliminary injunction was appropriate because the balance of hardships and consideration of the public interest favored the plaintiffs.  The Court of Appeals emphasized that any negative impact of the injunction on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training exercises was \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative,\xe2\x80\x9d and determined that (1) the 2,200-yard shutdown zone was unlikely to affect naval operations, because MFA sonar systems are often shut down during training exercises; and (2) the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions was not unreasonable, because such conditions are rare and the Navy has previously certified strike groups not trained under these conditions.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The preliminary injunction is vacated to the extent challenged by the Navy.  The balance of equities and the public interest\xe2\x80\x94which were barely addressed by the District Court\xe2\x80\x94tip strongly in favor of the Navy.  The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s need to conduct realistic training with active sonar to respond to the threat posed by enemy submarines plainly outweighs the interests advanced by the plaintiffs.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The lower courts held that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of success on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d of irreparable harm.  The \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard is too lenient.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s frequently reiterated standard requires plaintiffs seeking preliminary relief to demonstrate that irreparable injury is <em>likely </em>in the absence of an injunction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if plaintiffs have demonstrated a likelihood of irreparable injury, such injury is outweighed by the public interest and the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interest in effective, realistic training of its sailors.  For the same reason, it is unnecessary to address the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 holding that plaintiffs have established a likelihood of success on the merits.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0A preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.  In each case, courts must balance the competing claims of injury and consider the effect of granting or withholding the requested relief, paying particular regard to the public consequences.  <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Romero-Barcelo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/305/index.html">456 U. S. 305</a>, 312.  Military interests do not always trump other considerations, and the Court has not held that they do, but courts must give deference to the professional judgment of military authorities concerning the relative importance of a particular military interest.  <em>Goldman</em> v. <em>Weinberger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/503/index.html">475 U. S. 503</a>, 507.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the record contains declarations from some of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s most senior officers, all of whom underscored the threat posed by enemy submarines and the need for extensive sonar training to counter this threat.  Those officers emphasized that realistic training cannot be accomplished under the two challenged restrictions imposed by the District Court\xe2\x80\x94the 2,200-yard shutdown zone and the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions.  The use of MFA sonar under realistic conditions during training exercises is clearly of the utmost importance to the Navy and the Nation.  The Court does not question the importance of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ecological, scientific, and recreational interests, but it concludes that the balance of equities and consideration of the overall public interest tip strongly in favor of the Navy.  The determination of where the public interest lies in this case does not strike the Court as a close question.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 justifications for entering the preliminary injunction are not persuasive.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The District Court did not give serious consideration to the balance of equities and the public interest.  The Court of Appeals did consider these factors and conclude that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the preliminary injunction were \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative.\xe2\x80\x9d But that is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers\xe2\x80\x99 specific, predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s SOCAL training exercises.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The District Court abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to shut down MFA sonar when a marine mammal is spotted within 2,200 yards of a sonar-emitting vessel.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the zone would not be overly burdensome because marine mammal sightings during training exercises are relatively rare.  But regardless of the frequency of such sightings, the injunction will increase the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards, which expands its surface area by a factor of over 100.  Moreover, because training scenarios can take several days to develop, each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of training.  The Court of Appeals also concluded that the shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar several times during prior exercises when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s self-imposed 200-yard zone.  But the court ignored undisputed evidence that these voluntary shutdowns only occurred during tactically insignificant times.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The District Court also abused its discretion by requiring the Navy to power down MFA sonar by 6 decibels during significant surface ducting conditions.  When surface ducting occurs, active sonar becomes more useful near the surface, but less effective at greater depths.  Diesel-electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the power-down requirement was reasonable because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions.  This reasoning is backwards.  Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable, it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0The Navy has previously taken voluntary measures to address concerns about marine mammals, and has chosen not to challenge four other restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case.  But that hardly means that other, more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war.  The Court of Appeals noted that the Navy could return to the District Court to seek modification of the preliminary injunction if it actually resulted in an inability to train.  The Navy is not required to wait until it is unable to train sufficient forces for national defense before seeking dissolution of the preliminary injunction.  By then it may be too late.  P.\xc2\xa021.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0This Court does not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims, but the foregoing analysis makes clear that it would also be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction along the same lines as the preliminary injunction.  Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS, not that it must cease sonar training.  There is accordingly no basis for enjoining such training pending preparation of an EIS\xe2\x80\x94if one is determined to be required\xe2\x80\x94when doing so is credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security.  There are many other remedial tools available, including declaratory relief or an injunction specifically tailored to preparation of an EIS, that do not carry such dire consequences.

Richardson comp. 1897).  So said George Washington in his first Annual Address to Congress, 218 years ago.  One of the most important ways the Navy prepares for war is through integrated training exercises at sea.  These exercises include training in the use of modern sonar to detect and track enemy submarines, something the Navy has done for the past 40 years.  The plaintiffs complained that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s sonar training program harmed marine mammals, and that the Navy should have prepared an environmental impact statement before commencing its latest round of training exercises.  The Court of Appeals upheld a preliminary injunction imposing restrictions on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s sonar training, even though that court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record contains no evidence that marine mammals have been harmed\xe2\x80\x9d by the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s exercises.<em> </em>518 F.\xc2\xa03d 658, 696 (CA9 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals was wrong, and its decision is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy deploys its forces in \xe2\x80\x9cstrike groups,\xe2\x80\x9d which are groups of surface ships, submarines, and aircraft centered around either an aircraft carrier or an amphibious assault ship.

The parties strongly dispute the extent to which the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training activities will harm those animals or disrupt their behavioral patterns.  The Navy emphasizes that it has used MFA sonar during training exercises in SOCAL for 40 years, without a single documented sonar-related injury to any marine mammal.  The Navy asserts that, at most, MFA sonar may cause temporary hearing loss or brief disruptions of marine mammals\xe2\x80\x99 behavioral patterns.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plaintiffs are the Natural Resources Defense Council, Jean-Michael Cousteau (an environmental enthusiast and filmmaker), and several other groups devoted to the protection of marine mammals and ocean habitats.  They contend that MFA sonar can cause much more serious injuries to marine mammals than the Navy acknowledges, including permanent hearing loss, decompression sickness, and major behavioral disruptions.  According to the plaintiffs, several mass strandings of marine mammals (outside of SOCAL) have been \xe2\x80\x9cassociated\xe2\x80\x9d with the use of active sonar.  They argue that certain species of marine mammals\xe2\x80\x94such as beaked whales\xe2\x80\x94are uniquely susceptible to injury from active sonar; these injuries would not necessarily be detected by the Navy, given that beaked whales are \xe2\x80\x9cvery deep divers\xe2\x80\x9d that spend little time at the surface.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The procedural history of this case is rather complicated.  The Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), 86 Stat. 1027, generally prohibits any individual from \xe2\x80\x9ctaking\xe2\x80\x9d a marine mammal, defined as harassing, hunting, capturing, or killing it.  16 U.

In January 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense\xe2\x80\x94acting for the Secretary\xe2\x80\x94granted the Navy a 2-year exemption from the MMPA for the training exercises at issue in this case.

Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 briefs before this Court barely discuss the ground relied upon by the lower courts\xe2\x80\x94that the plain meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cemergency circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d does not encompass a court order that was \xe2\x80\x9centirely predictable\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 litigation history.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 681.  Instead, plaintiffs contend that the CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s actions violated the separation of powers by readjudicating a factual issue already decided by an Article III court.  Moreover, they assert that the CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s interpretations of NEPA are not entitled to deference because the CEQ has not been given statutory authority to conduct adjudications.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court and the Ninth Circuit also held that when a plaintiff demonstrates a strong likelihood of prevailing on the merits, a preliminary injunction may be entered based only on a \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d of irreparable harm.  <em>Id.</em>, at 696\xe2\x80\x93697; 530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1118 (quoting <em>Faith Center Church Evangelistic Ministries</em> v.<em> Glover</em>, 480 F.\xc2\xa03d 891, 906 (CA9 2007); <em>Earth Island Inst.</em> v. <em>United States Forest Serv.</em>, 442 F.\xc2\xa03d 1147, 1159 (CA9 2006)).  The lower courts held that plaintiffs had met this standard because the scientific studies, declarations, and other evidence in the record established to \xe2\x80\x9ca near certainty\xe2\x80\x9d that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training exercises would cause irreparable harm to the environment.  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1118.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy challenges these holdings, arguing that plaintiffs must demonstrate a likelihood of irreparable injury\xe2\x80\x94not just a possibility\xe2\x80\x94in order to obtain preliminary relief.  On the facts of this case, the Navy contends that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 alleged injuries are too speculative to give rise to irreparable injury, given that ever since the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training program began 40 years ago, there has been no documented case of sonar-related injury to marine mammals in SOCAL.  And even if MFA sonar does cause a limited number of injuries to individual <em>marine mammals</em>, the Navy asserts that plaintiffs have failed to offer evidence of species-level harm that would adversely affect <em>their</em> scientific, recreational, and ecological interests.  For their part, plaintiffs assert that they would prevail under any formulation of the irreparable injury standard, because the District Court found that they had established a \xe2\x80\x9cnear certainty\xe2\x80\x9d of irreparable harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with the Navy that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard is too lenient.

Although the court referred to the \xe2\x80\x9cpossibility\xe2\x80\x9d standard, and cited Circuit precedent along the same lines, it affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that plaintiffs had established a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98near certainty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of irreparable harm.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 696\xe2\x80\x93697.  At the same time, however, the nature of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is itself unclear.  The District Court originally found irreparable harm from sonar-training exercises generally.  But by the time of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s final decision, the Navy challenged only two of six restrictions imposed by the court.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The District Court did not reconsider the likelihood of irreparable harm in light of the four restrictions not challenged by the Navy.  This failure is significant in light of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s own statement that the 12-mile exclusion zone from the coastline\xe2\x80\x94one of the unchallenged mitigation restrictions\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwould bar the use of MFA sonar in a significant portion of important marine mammal habitat.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1119.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also find it pertinent that this is not a case in which the defendant is conducting a new type of activity with completely unknown effects on the environment.  When the Government conducts an activity, \xe2\x80\x9cNEPA itself does not mandate particular results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Robertson</em> v. <em>Methow Valley Citizens Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/332/index.html">490 U.

Part of the harm NEPA attempts to prevent in requiring an EIS is that, without one, there may be little if any information about prospective environmental harms and potential mitigating measures.  Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs are seeking to enjoin\xe2\x80\x94or substantially restrict\xe2\x80\x94training exercises that have been taking place in SOCAL for the last 40 years.  And the latest series of exercises were not approved until after the defendant took a \xe2\x80\x9chard look at environmental consequences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 350 (quoting <em>Kleppe</em> v. <em>Sierra Club</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/390/index.html">427 U.

In contrast, forcing the Navy to deploy an inadequately trained antisubmarine force jeopardizes the safety of the fleet.  Active sonar is the only reliable technology for detecting and tracking enemy diesel-electric submarines, and the President\xe2\x80\x94the Commander in Chief\xe2\x80\x94has determined that training with active sonar is \xe2\x80\x9cessential to national security.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet.

The subsequent Ninth Circuit panel framed its opinion as reviewing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of discretion, 518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 697\xe2\x80\x93699, but that discretion was barely exercised here.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that the balance of equities and the public interest favored the plaintiffs, largely based on its view that the preliminary injunction would not in fact impose a significant burden on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct its training exercises and certify its strike groups.  <em>Id.</em>, at 698\xe2\x80\x93699.  The court deemed the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the preliminary injunction \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative\xe2\x80\x9d because the Navy had not operated under similar procedures before.  <em>Ibid.  </em>But this is almost always the case when a plaintiff seeks injunctive relief to alter a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  The lower courts failed properly to defer to senior Navy officers\xe2\x80\x99 specific, predictive judgments about how the preliminary injunction would reduce the effectiveness of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s SOCAL training exercises.  See Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa72948.2, at 167\xe2\x80\x9368 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe policy against the imposition of judicial restraints prior to an adjudication of the merits becomes more significant when there is reason to believe that the decree will be burdensome\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xe2\x80\x82The preliminary injunction requires the Navy to shut down its MFA sonar if a marine mammal is detected within 2,200 yards of a sonar-emitting vessel.  The Ninth Circuit stated that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because sightings of marine mammals during training exercises are relatively rare.  But regardless of the frequency of marine mammal sightings, the injunction will greatly increase the size of the shutdown zone.  Pursuant to its exemption from the MMPA, the Navy agreed to reduce the power of its MFA sonar at 1,000 yards and 500 yards, and to completely turn off the system at 200 yards.  Pet. App. 222a\xe2\x80\x93230a.<font b="1">  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s injunction does not include a graduated power-down, instead requiring a total shutdown of MFA sonar if a marine mammal is detected within 2,200 yards of a sonar-emitting vessel.  There is an exponential relationship between radius length and surface area (Area =  r<font super="1">2).  Increasing the radius of the shutdown zone from 200 to 2,200 yards would accordingly expand the surface area of the shutdown zone by a factor of over 100 (from 125,664 square yards to 15,205,308 square yards).</font></font></p><font b="1"><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The lower courts did not give sufficient weight to the views of several top Navy officers, who emphasized that because training scenarios can take several days to develop, each additional shutdown can result in the loss of several days\xe2\x80\x99 worth of training.  <em>Id</em>., at 344a.  Limiting the number of sonar shutdowns is particularly important during the Joint Tactical Force Exercises, which usually last for less than two weeks.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Admiral Bird explained that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would cause operational commanders to \xe2\x80\x9close awareness of the tactical situation through the constant stopping and starting of MFA [sonar].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 332a; see also <em>id.</em>, at<em> </em>356a (\xe2\x80\x9cIt may take days to get to the pivotal attack in antisubmarine warfare, but only minutes to confound the results upon which certification is based\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even if there is a low likelihood of a marine mammal sighting, the preliminary injunction would clearly increase the number of disruptive sonar shutdowns the Navy is forced to perform during its SOCAL training exercises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also concluded that the 2,200-yard shutdown zone would not be overly burdensome because the Navy had shut down MFA sonar 27 times during its eight prior training exercises in SOCAL; in several of these cases, the Navy turned off its sonar when marine mammals were spotted well beyond the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s self-imposed 200-yard shutdown zone.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 700, n. 65.  Admiral Locklear\xe2\x80\x94the Commander of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s Third Fleet\xe2\x80\x94stated that any shutdowns beyond the 200-yard zone were voluntary avoidance measures that likely took place at tactically insignificant times; the Ninth Circuit discounted this explanation as not supported by the record.  <em>Ibid.  </em>In reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals ignored key portions of Admiral Locklear\xe2\x80\x99s declaration, in which he stated unequivocally that commanding officers \xe2\x80\x9cwould not shut down sonar until legally required to do so if in contact with a submarine.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. App. 354a\xe2\x80\x93355a.  Similarly, if a commanding officer is in contact with a target submarine, \xe2\x80\x9cthe CO will be expected to continue to use active sonar unless another ship or helicopter can gain contact or if regulatory reasons dictate otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 355a.  The record supports the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s contention that its shutdowns of MFA sonar during prior training exercises only occurred during tactically insignificant times; those voluntary shutdowns do not justify the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of a mandatory<em> </em>2,200-yard shutdown zone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lastly, the Ninth Circuit stated that a 2,200-yard shutdown zone was feasible because the Navy had previously adopted a 2,000-meter zone for low-frequency active (LFA) sonar.  The Court of Appeals failed to give sufficient weight to the fact that LFA sonar is used for long-range detection of enemy submarines, and thus its use and shutdown involve tactical considerations quite different from those associated with MFA sonar.  See App. 508 (noting that equating MFA sonar with LFA sonar \xe2\x80\x9cis completely misleading and is like comparing 20 degrees Fahrenheit to 20 degrees Celsius\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xe2\x80\x82The Court of Appeals also concluded that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training exercises would not be significantly affected by the requirement that it power down MFA sonar by 6 dB during significant surface ducting conditions.  Again, we think the Ninth Circuit understated the burden this requirement would impose on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to conduct realistic training exercises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Surface ducting is a phenomenon in which relatively little sound energy penetrates beyond a narrow layer near the surface of the water.  When surface ducting occurs, active sonar becomes more useful near the surface but less useful at greater depths.  Pet. App. 299a\xe2\x80\x93300a.  Diesel-electric submariners are trained to take advantage of these distortions to avoid being detected by sonar.  <em>Id.</em>, at 333a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit determined that the power-down requirement during surface ducting conditions was unlikely to affect certification of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s strike groups because surface ducting occurs relatively rarely, and the Navy has previously certified strike groups that did not train under such conditions.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 701\xe2\x80\x93702.  This reasoning is backwards.  Given that surface ducting is both rare and unpredictable, it is especially important for the Navy to be able to train under these conditions when they occur.  Admiral Bird explained that the 6 dB power-down requirement makes the training less valuable because it \xe2\x80\x9cexposes [sonar operators] to unrealistically lower levels of mutual interference caused by multiple sonar systems operating together by the ships within the Strike Group.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. App. 281a (footnote omitted).<font b="1">  Although a 6 dB reduction may not seem terribly significant, decibels are measured on a logarithmic scale, so a 6 dB decrease in power equates to a 75% reduction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 284a\xe2\x80\x93285a.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa04.\xe2\x80\x82The District Court acknowledged that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the imposition of these mitigation measures will require the Navy to alter and adapt the way it conducts antisubmarine warfare training\xe2\x80\x94a substantial challenge.  Nevertheless, evidence presented to the Court reflects that the Navy has employed mitigation measures in the past, without sacrificing training objectives.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  527 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1238.  Apparently no good deed goes unpunished.  The fact that the Navy has taken measures in the past to address concerns about marine mammals\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, has elected not to challenge four additional restrictions imposed by the District Court in this case,<em> </em>see <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x94hardly means that other, more intrusive restrictions pose no threat to preparedness for war.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals concluded its opinion by stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Navy may return to the district court to request relief on an emergency basis\xe2\x80\x9d if the preliminary injunction \xe2\x80\x9cactually result[s] in an inability to train and certify sufficient naval forces to provide for the national defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 703.  This is cold comfort to the Navy.  The Navy contends that the injunction will hinder efforts to train sonar operators under realistic conditions, ultimately leaving strike groups more vulnerable to enemy submarines.  Unlike the Ninth Circuit, we do not think the Navy is required to wait until the injunction \xe2\x80\x9cactually result[s] in an inability to train . . . sufficient naval forces for the national defense\xe2\x80\x9d before seeking its dissolution.  By then it may be too late.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted above, we do not address the underlying merits of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  While we have authority to proceed to such a decision at this point, see <em>Munaf</em>, 553 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314), doing so is not necessary here.  In addition, reaching the merits is complicated by the fact that the lower courts addressed only one of several issues raised, and plaintiffs have largely chosen not to defend the decision below on that ground.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, what we have said makes clear that it would be an abuse of discretion to enter a permanent injunction, after final decision on the merits, along the same lines as the preliminary injunction.  An injunction is a matter of equitable discretion; it does not follow from success on the merits as a matter of course.  <em>Romero-Barcelo</em>, 456 U. S., at 313 (\xe2\x80\x9ca federal judge sitting as chancellor is not mechanically obligated to grant an injunction for every violation of law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The factors examined above\xe2\x80\x94the balance of equities and consideration of the public interest\xe2\x80\x94are pertinent in assessing the propriety of any injunctive relief, preliminary or permanent.  See <em>Amoco Production Co.</em>, 480 U. S., at 546, n.\xc2\xa012 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe standard for a preliminary injunction is essentially the same as for a permanent injunction with the exception that the plaintiff must show a likelihood of success on the merits rather than actual success\xe2\x80\x9d).  Given that the ultimate legal claim is that the Navy must prepare an EIS, not that it must cease sonar training, there is no basis for enjoining such training in a manner credibly alleged to pose a serious threat to national security.  This is particularly true in light of the fact that the training has been going on for 40 years with no documented episode of harm to a marine mammal.  A court concluding that the Navy is required to prepare an EIS has many remedial tools at its disposal, including declaratory relief or an injunction tailored to the preparation of an EIS rather than the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training in the interim.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Steffel</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/452/index.html">415 U. S. 452</a>, 466 (1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress plainly intended declaratory relief to act as an alternative to the strong medicine of the injunction\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the meantime, we see no basis for jeopardizing national security, as the present injunction does.  Plaintiffs confirmed at oral argument that the preliminary injunction was \xe2\x80\x9cthe whole ball game,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, and our analysis of the propriety of preliminary relief is applicable to any permanent injunction as well.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0President Theodore Roosevelt explained that \xe2\x80\x9cthe only way in which a navy can ever be made efficient is by practice at sea, under all the conditions which would have to be met if war existed.\xe2\x80\x9d  President\xe2\x80\x99s Annual Message, 42 Cong. Rec. 67, 81 (1907).  We do not discount the importance of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ecological, scientific, and recreational interests in marine mammals.  Those interests, however, are plainly outweighed by the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s need to conduct realistic training exercises to ensure that it is able to neutralize the threat posed by enemy submarines.  The District Court abused its discretion by imposing a 2,200-yard shutdown zone and by requiring the Navy to power down its MFA sonar during significant surface ducting conditions.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the preliminary injunction is vacated to the extent it has been challenged by the Navy.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In contrast, passive sonar \xe2\x80\x9clistens\xe2\x80\x9d for sound waves but does not introduce sound into the water.

As to the injunction, the dissent barely mentions the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  <em>Post</em>, at 11.

The Navy does not challenge its obligation to do so, and it represents that the EIS will be complete in January 2009\xe2\x80\x94one month after the instant exercises conclude.  If the Navy had completed the EIS before taking action, as NEPA instructs, the parties and the public could have benefited from the environmental analysis\xe2\x80\x94and the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training could have proceeded without interruption.  Instead, the Navy acted first, and thus thwarted the very purpose an EIS is intended to serve.  To justify its course, the Navy sought dispensation not from Congress, but from an executive council that lacks authority to countermand or revise NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  I would hold that, in imposing manageable measures to mitigate harm until completion of the EIS, the District Court conscientiously balanced the equities and did not abuse its discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2006, the Navy announced its intent to prepare an EIS to address the potential environmental effects of its naval readiness activities in the Southern California (SOCAL) Range Complex.  See 71 Fed. Reg. 76639 (2006).  These readiness activities include expansion and intensification of naval training, as well as research, development, and testing of various systems and weapons.  <em>Id.</em>, at 76639, 76640.  The EIS process is underway, and the Navy represents that it will be complete in January 2009.  Brief for Petitioners 11; Tr. of Oral Arg. 11.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February 2007, seeking to commence training before completion of the EIS, the Navy prepared an Environmental Assessment (EA) for the 14 exercises it planned to undertake in the interim.  See App. L to Pet. for Cert. 235a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On February 12, the Navy concluded the EA with a finding of no significant impact.  App. 225\xe2\x80\x93226.  The same day, the Navy commenced its training exercises.  <em>Id.</em>, at 227 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Proposed Action is hereby implemented.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On March 22, 2007, the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) filed suit in the U. S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief based on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s alleged violations of NEPA and other environmental statutes.  As relevant here, the District Court determined that NRDC was likely to succeed on its NEPA claim and that equitable principles warranted preliminary relief.  On August 7, 2007, the court enjoined the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s use of mid-frequency active (MFA) sonar during the 11 remaining exercises at issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On August 31, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit stayed the injunction pending disposition of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s appeal, and the Navy proceeded with two more exercises.  In a November 13 order, the Court of Appeals vacated the stay, stating that NRDC had shown \xe2\x80\x9ca strong likelihood of success on the merits\xe2\x80\x9d and that preliminary injunctive relief was appropriate.  508 F.\xc2\xa03d 885, 886 (2007).  The Court of Appeals remanded, however, instructing the District Court to provide mitigation measures under which the Navy could conduct its remaining exercises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the District Court received briefing from both parties.  In addition, the court \xe2\x80\x9ctoured the <em>USS Milius</em> at the naval base in San Diego, California, to improve its understanding of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s sonar training procedures and the feasibility of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 proposed mitigation measures.  Counsel for both [parties] were present.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1110, 1112 (2008).  On January 3, 2008, the District Court entered a modified preliminary injunction imposing six mitigation measures.  The court revised the modified injunction slightly on January 10 in response to filings by the Navy, and four days later, denied the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s application for a stay pending appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the following day, January 15, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), an advisory body within the Executive Office of the President, responded to the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s request for \xe2\x80\x9calternative arrangements\xe2\x80\x9d for NEPA compliance.  App. L to Pet. for Cert. 233a.<em> </em>The \xe2\x80\x9carrangements\xe2\x80\x9d CEQ set out purported to permit the Navy to continue its training without timely environmental review.  <em>Id.</em>, at 241a\xe2\x80\x93247a.<em> </em>The Navy accepted the arrangements on the same day.  App. 228.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Navy then filed an emergency motion in the Court of Appeals requesting immediate vacatur of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s modified injunction.  CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s action, the Navy urged, eliminated the injunction\xe2\x80\x99s legal foundation.  In the alternative, the Navy sought a stay of two aspects of the injunction pending its appeal: the 2,200-yard mandatory shutdown zone and the power-down requirement in significant surface ducting conditions, see <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  While targeting in its stay application only two of the six measures imposed by the District Court, the Navy explicitly reserved the right to challenge on appeal each of the six mitigation measures.  Responding to the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s emergency motion, the Court of Appeals remanded the matter to allow the District Court to determine in the first instance the effect of the intervening executive action.  Pending its own consideration of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s motion, the District Court stayed the injunction, and the Navy conducted its sixth exercise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On February 4, after briefing and oral argument, the District Court denied the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  The Navy appealed, reiterating its position that CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s action eliminated all justification for the injunction.  The Navy also argued that vacatur of the entire injunction was required irrespective of CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s action, in part because the \xe2\x80\x9cconditions imposed, in particular the 2,200 yard mandatory shutdown zone and the six decibel (75%) power-down in significant surface ducting conditions, severely degrade the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellants in No. 08\xe2\x80\x9355054 (CA9), p. 15.  In the February 29 decision now under review, the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d 658, 703 (2008).  The Navy has continued training in the meantime and plans to complete its final exercise in December 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the procedural history indicates, the courts below determined that an EIS was required for the 14 exercises.  The Navy does not challenge that decision in this Court.

The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s inverted timing, it bears emphasis, is the very reason why the District Court had to confront the question of mitigation measures at all.  Had the Navy prepared a legally sufficient EIS before beginning the SOCAL exercises, NEPA would have functioned as its drafters intended: The EIS process and associated public input might have convinced the Navy voluntarily to adopt mitigation measures, but NEPA itself would not have impeded the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s exercises.  See <em>Public Citizen</em>, 541 U.

Most importantly, it could have requested assistance from Congress.  The Government has sometimes obtained congressional authorization to proceed with planned activities without fulfilling NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Floyd D. Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, Pub.

On January 10, 2008, the Navy asked CEQ, adviser to the President, to approve alternative arrangements for NEPA compliance pursuant to 40 CFR \xc2\xa71506.11 (1987).  App. L to Pet. for Cert. 233a; see <em>ante</em>, at 8, n. 3.  The next day, the Navy submitted supplementary material to CEQ, including the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s EA and after-action reports, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders, and two analyses by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). App. L to Pet. for Cert. 237a\xe2\x80\x93238a.  Neither the Navy nor CEQ notified NRDC, and CEQ did not request or consider any of the materials underlying the District Court orders it addressed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Four days later, on January 15, the Chairman of CEQ issued a letter to the Secretary of the Navy.  Repeating the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s submissions with little independent analysis, the letter stated that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s orders posed risks to the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training exercises.  See <em>id.</em>, at 238a (\xe2\x80\x9cYou have explained that the training restrictions set forth in the \xe2\x80\xa6 injunctive orders prevent the Navy from providing Strike Groups with adequate proficiency training and create a substantial risk of precluding certification of the Strike Groups as combat ready.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The letter continued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDiscussions between our staffs, your letter and supporting documents, and the classified declaration and briefings I have received, have clearly determined that the Navy cannot ensure the necessary training to certify strike groups for deployment under the terms of the injunctive orders.  Based on the record supporting your request \xe2\x80\xa6 CEQ has concluded that the Navy must be able to conduct the [exercises] \xe2\x80\xa6 in a timeframe that does not provide sufficient time to complete an EIS.  Therefore, emergency circumstances are present for the nine exercises and alternative arrangements for compliance with NEPA under CEQ regulation 40 C.F.R. \xc2\xa71506.11 are warranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 240a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The alternative arrangements CEQ set forth do not vindicate NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s objectives.

The notices must \xe2\x80\x9cseek input on the process for reviewing post-exercise assessments\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinclude an offer to meet jointly with Navy representatives \xe2\x80\xa6 and CEQ to discuss the alternative arrangements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 242a\xe2\x80\x93243a.  The alternative arrangements also describe the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s existing research and mitigation efforts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 243a\xe2\x80\x93247a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s hasty decision on a one-sided record is no substitute for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s considered judgment based on a two-sided record.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  More fundamentally, even an exemplary CEQ review could not have effected the short circuit the Navy sought.  CEQ lacks authority to absolve an agency of its statutory duty to prepare an EIS.  NEPA established CEQ to assist and advise the President on environmental policy, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa74342, and a 1977 Executive Order charged CEQ with issuing regulations to federal agencies for implementation of NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s procedural provisions, Exec. Order No. 11991, 3 CFR 123 (1977 Comp.).  This Court has recognized that CEQ\xe2\x80\x99s regulations are entitled to \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial deference,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Robertson</em>, 490 U. S., at 355, and \xc2\xa71506.11 indicates that CEQ may play an important consultative role in emergency circumstances, but we have never suggested that CEQ could eliminate the statute\xe2\x80\x99s command.  If the Navy sought to avoid its NEPA obligations, its remedy lay in the Legislative Branch.  The Navy\xe2\x80\x99s alternative course\xe2\x80\x94rapid, self-serving resort to an office in the White House\xe2\x80\x94is surely not what Congress had in mind when it instructed agencies to comply with NEPA \xe2\x80\x9cto the fullest extent possible.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

Flexibility rather than rigidity has distinguished it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weinberger</em> v. <em>Romero-Barcelo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/305/index.html">456 U.

Consistent with equity\xe2\x80\x99s character, courts do not insist that litigants uniformly show a particular, predetermined quantum of probable success or injury before awarding equitable relief.  Instead, courts have evaluated claims for equitable relief on a \xe2\x80\x9csliding scale,\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes awarding relief based on a lower likelihood of harm when the likelihood of success is very high.  11A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa72948.3, p. 195 (2d ed. 1995).

Because an EIS is the tool for <em>uncovering </em>environmental harm, environmental plaintiffs may often rely more heavily on their probability of success than the likelihood of harm.  The Court is correct that relief is not warranted \xe2\x80\x9csimply to prevent the possibility of some remote future injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12 (quoting Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa72948.1, at 155).  \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, the injury need not have been inflicted when application is made or be certain to occur; a strong threat of irreparable injury before trial is an adequate basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wright &amp; Miller, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa72948.1, at 155\xe2\x80\x93156 (footnote omitted).

Sonar is linked to mass strandings of marine mammals, hemorrhaging around the brain and ears, acute spongiotic changes in the central nervous system, and lesions in vital organs.  <em>E.g.</em>, App. 600\xe2\x80\x93602; 360\xe2\x80\x93362; 478\xe2\x80\x93479.  As the Ninth Circuit noted, the EA predicts that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cuse of MFA sonar in the SOCAL exercises will result in 564 instances of physical injury including permanent hearing loss (Level A harassment) and nearly 170,000 behavioral disturbances (Level B harassment), more than 8,000 of which would also involve temporary hearing loss.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 696; see App. 223\xe2\x80\x93224.  Within those totals,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe EA predicts 436 Level A harassments of Cuvier\xe2\x80\x99s beaked whales, of which, according to NOAA, as few as 1,121 may exist in California, Oregon and Washington combined.  Likewise, the EA predicts 1,092 Level B harassments of bottlenose dolphins, of which only 5,271 may exist in the California Coastal and Offshore stocks.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 691\xe2\x80\x93692.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority acknowledges the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 findings, <em>ante</em>, at 9, but also states that the EA predicted \xe2\x80\x9conly eight Level A harassments of common dolphins each year\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c274 Level B harassments of beaked whales per year, none of which would result in permanent injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Those numbers do not fully capture the EA\xe2\x80\x99s predictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EA classified the harassments of beaked whales as Level A, not Level B.  The EA does indeed state that \xe2\x80\x9cmodeling predicts non-injurious Level B exposures.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 185.  But, as the majority correctly notes, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 6, the EA also states that \xe2\x80\x9call beaked whale exposures are counted as Level A,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 185.  The EA counted the predicted exposures as Level A \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y Navy policy developed in conjunction with NMFS.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 200.  The record reflects \xe2\x80\x9cthe known sensitivity of these species to tactical sonar,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 365 (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration letter), and as the majority acknowledges, beaked whales are difficult to study, <em>ante</em>, at 6.  Further, as the Ninth Circuit noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe EA \xe2\x80\xa6 maintained that the methodology used was based on the \xe2\x80\x98best available science.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, this likely harm\xe2\x80\x94170,000 behavioral disturbances, including 8,000 instances of temporary hearing loss; and 564 Level A harms, including 436 injuries to a beaked whale population numbering only 1,121\xe2\x80\x94cannot be lightly dismissed, even in the face of an alleged risk to the effectiveness of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s 14 training exercises.  There is no doubt that the training exercises serve critical interests.  But those interests do not authorize the Navy to violate a statutory command, especially when recourse to the Legislature remains open.  \xe2\x80\x9cOf course, military interests do not always trump other considerations, and we have not held that they do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the likely, substantial harm to the environment, NRDC\xe2\x80\x99s almost inevitable success on the merits of its claim that NEPA required the Navy to prepare an EIS, the history of this litigation, and the public interest, I cannot agree that the mitigation measures the District Court imposed signal an abuse of discretion.

The Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., and others (hereinafter NRDC) brought this case in Federal District Court claiming that the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) requires the Navy to prepare an environmental impact statement (EIS) (assessing the impact of the exercises on marine mammals) prior to its engaging in the exercises.  As the case reaches us, the District Court has found that the NRDC will likely prevail on its demand for an EIS; the Navy has agreed to prepare an EIS; the District Court has forbidden the Navy to proceed with the exercises unless it adopts six mitigating measures; and the Navy has agreed to adopt all but two of those measures.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The controversy between the parties now concerns the two measures that the Navy is unwilling to adopt.  The first concerns the \xe2\x80\x9cshutdown zone,\xe2\x80\x9d a circle with a ship at the center within which the Navy must try to spot marine mammals and shut down its sonar if one is found.  The controverted condition would enlarge the radius of that circle from about one-tenth of a mile (200 yards) to one and one-quarter mile (2,200 yards).  The second concerns special ocean conditions called \xe2\x80\x9csurface ducting conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  The controverted condition would require the Navy, when it encounters any such condition, to diminish the sonar\xe2\x80\x99s power by 75%.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court order that contained these two conditions.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d 658, 703 (CA9 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must now decide whether the District Court was legally correct in forbidding the training exercises <em>unless </em>the Navy implemented the two controverted conditions.  In doing so, I assume, like the Court, that the NRDC will prevail on its demand for an EIS.   (Indeed, the Navy is in the process of preparing one.)  And, I would ask whether, in imposing these conditions, the District Court properly \xe2\x80\x9cbalance[d the] harms.\xe2\x80\x9d   See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Amoco Production Co.</em> v. <em>Gambell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/531/index.html">480 U.

As Justice Ginsburg well points out, see <em>post</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (dissenting opinion), the very point of NEPA\xe2\x80\x99s insistence upon the writing of an EIS is to force an agency \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider \xe2\x80\xa6 detailed information concerning significant environmental impacts,\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cgiv[ing] the public the assurance that the agency \xe2\x80\x98has indeed considered environmental concerns in its decisionmaking process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Robertson</em> v. <em>Methow Valley Citizens Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/332/index.html">490 U. S. 332</a>, 349 (1989).  NEPA seeks to assure that when Government officials consider taking action that may affect the environment, they do so fully aware of the relevant environmental considerations.  An EIS does not force them to make any particular decision, but it does lead them to take environmental considerations into account when they decide whether, or how, to act.  <em>Id.</em>, at 354.  Thus, when a decision to which EIS obligations attach is made without the informed environmental consideration that NEPA requires, much of the harm that NEPA seeks to prevent has already taken place.  In this case, for example, the <em>absence </em>of an injunction means that the Navy will proceed with its exercises in the absence of the fuller consideration of environmental effects that an EIS is intended to bring.  The absence of an injunction thereby threatens to cause the very environmental harm that a full preaction EIS might have led the Navy to avoid (say, by adopting the two additional mitigation measures that the NRDC proposes).  Consequently, if the exercises are to continue, conditions designed to mitigate interim environmental harm may well be appropriate. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, several features of this case lead me to conclude that the record, as now before us, lacks adequate support for an injunction imposing the two controverted requirements.  <em>First</em>, the evidence of need for the two special conditions is weak or uncertain. The record does show that the exercises as the Navy originally proposed them could harm marine mammals.  The District Court found (based on the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s study of the matter) that the exercises might cause 466 instances of Level A harm and 170,000 instances of Level B harm.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 196a\xe2\x80\x93197a.  (The environmental assessment (EA) actually predicted 564 instances of Level A harm.  See App. 223\xe2\x80\x93224.)  The study defines Level A injury as \xe2\x80\x9cany act that injures or has the significant potential to injure a marine mammal or marine mammal stock in the wild\xe2\x80\x9d through \xe2\x80\x9cdestruction or loss of biological tissue,\xe2\x80\x9d whether \xe2\x80\x9cslight to severe.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 160.  It defines Level B harm as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any act that disturbs or is likely to disturb a marine mammal \xe2\x80\xa6 by causing disruption of natural behavioral patterns including, but not limited to, migration, surfacing, nursing, breeding, feeding, or sheltering to a point where such behaviors are abandoned or significantly altered\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and describes it as a \xe2\x80\x9cshort term\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdisturbance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 161, 175.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The raw numbers seem large.  But the parties argue about the extent to which they mean likely harm.  The Navy says the classifications and estimates err on the side of caution. (When in doubt about the amount of harm to a mammal, the study assumed the harm would qualify as Level A harassment.  <em>Id.</em>, at 200.)  The Navy also points out that, by definition, mammals recover from Level B injuries, often very quickly.  It notes that, despite 40 years of naval exercises off the southern California coast, no injured marine mammal has ever been found.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 274a\xe2\x80\x93275a.  (It adds that dolphins often swim alongside the ships.  <em>Id.</em>, at 290, 346.)  At the same time, plaintiffs point to instances where whales have been found stranded.  They add that scientific studies have found a connection between those beachings and the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s use of sonar, see, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 600\xe2\x80\x93602, and the Navy has even acknowledged one stranding where \xe2\x80\x9cU. S. Navy mid-frequency sonar has been identified as the most plausible contributory source to the stranding event,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 168. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the uncertainty the figures create in respect to the harm caused by the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s original training plans, it would seem important to have before us at least some estimate of the harm likely avoided by the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to contest here <em>four of the six mitigating conditions </em>that the District Court ordered.  Without such evidence, it is difficult to assess the <em>relevant </em>harm\xe2\x80\x94that is, the environmental harm likely caused by the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s exercises with the four uncontested mitigation measures (but without the two contested mitigation measures) in place. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Second</em>, the Navy has filed multiple affidavits from Navy officials explaining in detail the seriousness of the harm that the delay associated with completion of this EIS (approximately one year) would create in respect to the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s ability to maintain an adequate national defense.  See generally<em> </em>App. to Pet. for Cert. 260a\xe2\x80\x93357a.  Taken by themselves, those affidavits make a strong case for the proposition that insistence upon the two additional mitigating conditions would seriously interfere with necessary defense training. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The affidavits explain the importance of training in antisubmarine warfare, <em>id.</em>, at 263a; the need to use active sonar to detect enemy submarines, <em>id.</em>, at 266a\xe2\x80\x93267a, App. 566; the complexity of a training exercise involving sonar, App. to Pet. for Cert. 343a; the need for realistic conditions when training exercises take place, <em>id.</em>, at 299a\xe2\x80\x93300a, App. 566; the \xe2\x80\x9ccascading\xe2\x80\x9d negative \xe2\x80\x9ceffect\xe2\x80\x9d that delay in one important aspect of a set of coordinated training exercises has upon the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s ability \xe2\x80\x9cto provide combat ready forces,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 343a; the cost and disruption that would accompany the adoption of the two additional mitigating conditions that the NRDC seeks,  <em>ibid.</em>; the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s  resulting inability adequately to train personnel, <em>id.</em>, at 278a; the effectiveness of the mammal-protecting measures that the Navy has taken in the past, <em>id.</em>, at 285a\xe2\x80\x93298a; and the reasonable likelihood that the mitigating conditions to which it has agreed will prove adequate, <em>id.</em>, at 296a.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Third</em>, and particularly important in my view, the District Court did not explain <em>why </em>it rejected the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit-supported contentions. In its first opinion enjoining the use of sonar, the District Court simply stated: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court is \xe2\x80\xa6 satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor of granting an injunction, as the harm to the environment, Plaintiffs, and public interest outweighs the harm that Defendants would incur if prevented from using [mid-frequency active (MFA)] sonar, absent the use of effective mitigation measures, during a subset of their regular activities in one part of one state for a limited period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 217a\xe2\x80\x93218a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nFollowing remand from the Court of Appeals, the District Court simply repeated, word for word, this same statement.  It said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court is . . . satisfied that the balance of hardships tips in favor of granting an injunction, as the harm to the environment, Plaintiffs, and public interest outweighs the harm that Defendants would incur (or the public interest would suffer) if Defendants were prevented from using MFA sonar, absent the use of effective mitigation measures, during a subset of their regular activities in one part of one state for a limited period.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1110, 1118 (CD Cal. 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWith respect to the imposition of the 2,200 yard shutdown zone, the District Court noted evidence of the harm that MFA sonar poses to marine mammals, and then concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Court therefore is persuaded that while the 2200 yard shutdown requirement may protect marine mammals from the harshest of sonar-related consequences, it represents a minimal imposition [on] the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training exercises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1119.  The District Court did not there explain the basis for that conclusion.  With respect to the imposition of the surface ducting condition, the District Court said nothing about the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s interests at all.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1120\xe2\x80\x931121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While a District Court is often free simply to state its conclusion in summary fashion, in this instance neither that conclusion, nor anything else I have found in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, answers the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s documented claims that the two extra conditions the District Court imposed will, in effect, seriously interfere with its ability to carry out necessary training exercises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first condition requires the Navy to reduce the power of its sonar equipment by 75% when the ship encounters a condition called \xe2\x80\x9csurface ducting\xe2\x80\x9d that occurs when the presence of layers of water of different temperature make it unusually difficult for sonar operators to determine whether a diesel submarine is hiding below.  Rear Admiral John Bird, an expert in submarine warfare, made clear that the 75% power-reduction requirement was equivalent to forbidding any related training.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 297a.  But he says in paragraph 52 of his declaration: \xe2\x80\x9cTraining in surface ducting conditions is critical to effective training because sonar operators need to learn how sonar transmissions are altered due to surface ducting and how submarines may take advantage of them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 299a\xe2\x80\x93300a.  The District Court, as far as I can tell, did not even acknowledge in its opinion the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in being able to train under these conditions.  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1120\xe2\x80\x931121.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second condition requires the Navy to expand the sonar \xe2\x80\x9cshutdown\xe2\x80\x9d area surrounding a ship (<em>i.e.</em>, turn off the sonar if a mammal is spotted in the area) from a circle with a radius of about one-tenth of a mile to a circle with a radius of about one mile and a quarter.  Both sides agree that this requirement will lead to more shutdowns.  Admiral Gary Roughead, Chief of Naval Operations, states in paragraph 12 of his declaration that this expanded zone requirement \xe2\x80\x9cwill result in increased interruptions to training exercises, . . . vastly increas[ing] the risk of negating training effectiveness, preventing strike group certification, and disrupting carefully orchestrated deployment plans to meet world-wide operational commitments.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 344a.  Again, I can find nothing in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that specifically explains why this is not so.  530 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1119\xe2\x80\x931120.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fourth</em>, the Court of Appeals sought, through its own thorough examination of the record, to supply the missing explanations.  But those explanations are not sufficient.  In respect to the surface ducting conditions, the Court of Appeals rejected the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s contentions on the ground that those conditions are \xe2\x80\x9crar[e],\xe2\x80\x9d and the Navy has certified trainings that did not involve any encounter with those conditions.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 701\xe2\x80\x93702.  I am not certain, however, why the rarity of the condition supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  Rarity argues as strongly for training when the condition is encountered as it argues for the contrary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respect to the expansion of the \xe2\x80\x9cshutdown\xe2\x80\x9d area, the Court of Appeals noted that (1) the Navy in earlier exercises had shut down its sonar when marine mammals were sited within about one-half a mile, (2) the Navy has used a larger shutdown area when engaged in exercises with lower frequency sonar equipment, and (3) foreign navies have used larger shutdown areas.  <em>Id.</em>, at 699\xe2\x80\x93701, and nn. 63, 67.  But the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s affidavits state that (1) earlier shutdowns when marine mammals were spotted at farther distances \xe2\x80\x9clikely occurred during tactically insignificant times,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 356a, (2) ships with low frequency sonar (unlike the sonar here at issue) have equipment that makes it easier to monitor the larger area, particularly by significantly reducing the number of monitoring personnel necessarily involved, and (3) foreign navy experience is not relevant given the potentially different military demands upon those navies, App. 508\xe2\x80\x93509.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals, mirroring a similar District Court suggestion in the language I have quoted, says that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercises in southern California are only a subset of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s training activities involving active sonar.\xe2\x80\x9d  518 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 702.  It adds that the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s study \xe2\x80\x9cshows the Navy is still able to conduct its exercises in alternative locations, in reduced number, or through simulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n. 69.  The Court of Appeals, however, also concluded that the study \xe2\x80\x9cprovides reasonably detailed justifications for why the Southern California Operating Area is uniquely suited to these exercises, and demonstrates that the Navy would suffer a certain hardship if the considered alternatives were employed instead.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Fifth</em>, when the Court of Appeals first heard this case following the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of a broad, absolute injunction, it held that any injunction must be crafted so that the Navy could continue its training exercises.  Noting that the Navy had, in the past, been able to use mitigation measures to \xe2\x80\x9creduce the harmful effects of its active sonar,\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cvacate[d] the stay and remand[ed] this matter to the district court to narrow its injunction so as to provide mitigation conditions <em>under which the Navy may conduct its training exercises</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  508 F.\xc2\xa03d 885, 887 (CA9 2007) (emphasis added).  For the reasons just stated, neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals has explained why we should reject the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that it cannot effectively conduct its training exercises under the mitigation conditions imposed by the District Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would thus vacate the preliminary injunction imposed by the District Court to the extent it has been challenged by the Navy.  Neither the District Court nor the Court of Appeals has adequately explained its conclusion that the balance of the equities tips in favor of plaintiffs.  Nor do those parts of the record to which the parties have pointed supply the missing explanation.  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, as the Court of Appeals held when it first considered this case, the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s past use of mitigation conditions makes clear that the Navy can effectively train under <em>some </em>mitigation conditions.  In the ordinary course, I would remand so the District Court could, pursuant to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 direction, set forth mitigation conditions that will protect the marine wildlife while also enabling the Navy to carry out its exercises.  But, at this point, the Navy has informed us that this set of exercises will be complete by January, at the latest, and an EIS will likely be complete at that point, as well.  Thus, by the time the District Court would have an opportunity to impose new conditions, the case could very well be moot.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February of this year, the Court of Appeals stayed the injunction imposed by the District Court\xe2\x80\x94<em>but only pending this Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the case</em>.  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n light of the short time before the Navy is to commence its next exercise, the importance of the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s mission to provide for the national defense and the representation by the Chief of Naval Operations that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s preliminary injunction in its current form will \xe2\x80\x98unacceptably risk\xe2\x80\x99 effective training and strike group certification and thereby interfere with his statutory responsibility . . . to \xe2\x80\x98organiz[e], train[], and equip[] the Navy,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d interim relief was appropriate, and the court then modified the two mitigation conditions at issue.  518 F.\xc2\xa03d 704, 705 (CA9 2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the 2,200 yard shutdown zone, it required the Navy to suspend its use of the sonar if a marine mammal is detected within 2,200 yards, <em>except</em> when sonar is being used at a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical point in the exercise,\xe2\x80\x9d in which case the amount by which the Navy must power down is proportional to the mammal\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to the sonar.  <em>Id.</em>, at 705\xe2\x80\x93706 (internal quotation marks omitted).  With respect to surface ducting, the Navy is only required to shut down sonar altogether when a marine mammal is detected within 500 meters and the amount by which it is otherwise required to power down is again proportional to the mammal\xe2\x80\x99s proximity to the sonar source.  <em>Id.</em>, at 705\xe2\x80\x93706.  The court believed these conditions would permit the Navy to go forward with its imminently planned exercises while at the same time minimizing the harm to marine wildlife. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the modified conditions imposed by the Court of Appeals in its February stay order reflect the best equitable conditions that can be created in the short time available before the exercises are complete and the EIS is ready.  The Navy has been training under these conditions since February, so allowing them to remain in place will, in effect, maintain what has become the status quo.  Therefore, I would modify the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 February 29, 2008, order so that the provisional conditions it contains remain in place until the Navy\xe2\x80\x99s completion of an acceptable EIS.  </p>\n</font></font></font></div><font caps="1"><font caps="1"><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font caps="1"><font caps="1"><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></div>'
