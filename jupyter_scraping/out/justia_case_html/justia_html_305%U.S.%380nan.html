Plaintiff contended that the tax was on "the act of receiving" and hence was a direct burden upon interstate commerce. The Court of Appeals of Kentucky thus construed the statute:</p>\n<p>"The word \'receipt\' is not used in a limited sense, but in the sense that it has already been received by the retailer and is now in his use. . . . The word \'receipt\' presupposes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 305 U. S. 381</a></p><p> that the cosmetics were now in use and after the sale had been consummated."</p>\n<p>". . .  It therefore follows that the imposition of the tax against the retailer is not on the act of receiving the cosmetics, but on the sale and use thereof, after the retailer has received them, that constitutes the excise tax.  When we apply the intended and correct meaning of the word \'receipt\' as used in the act, it is conclusive to our minds that the tax of the retailer referred to is paid when the articles are in his possession and when the merchant has unlimited control and dominion over the cosmetics."</p>\n<p><em>Martin v. J. Bacon &amp; Sons,</em> 268 Ky. 612, 105 S.W.2d 569, 572.</p>\n<p>Adhering to that construction, the state court affirmed the present judgment sustaining the tax.  273 Ky. 389, 116 S.W.2d 963.  The plaintiff appeals.</p>\n<p>The construction of the statute by the state court is binding upon us.  <em>Supreme Lodge, Knights of Pythias v.
