UNITED STATES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SKILLING <em>v</em>. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931394.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 1, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 24, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company in America.  Petitioner Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron officer, was Enron\xe2\x80\x99s chief executive officer from February until August 2001, when he resigned.  Less than four months later, Enron crashed into bankruptcy, and its stock plummeted in value.  After an investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron\xe2\x80\x99s stock prices by overstating the company\xe2\x80\x99s financial well-being, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme.  In time, the Government worked its way up the chain of command, indicting Skilling and two other top Enron executives.  These three defendants, the indictment charged, engaged in a scheme to deceive investors about Enron\xe2\x80\x99s true financial performance by manipulating its publicly reported financial results and making false and misleading statements.  Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with, <em>inter alia,</em> conspiracy to commit \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services\xe2\x80\x9d wire fraud, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7371, 1343, 1346, by depriving Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of his honest services.  Skilling was also charged with over 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s auditors, and insider trading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2004, Skilling moved for a change of venue, contending that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors.  He submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enron\xe2\x80\x99s downfall, as well as affidavits from experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.  The District Court denied the motion, concluding that pretrial publicity did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.  Despite incidents of intemperate commentary, the court observed, media coverage, on the whole, had been objective and unemotional, and the facts of the case were neither heinous nor sensational.  Moreover, the court asserted, effective <em>voir dire</em> would detect juror bias.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the months before the trial, the court asked the parties for questions it might use to screen prospective jurors.  Rejecting the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s more probing and specific questions, the court converted Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document.  The questionnaire asked prospective jurors about their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.  The court then mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all of them.  It granted hardship exemptions to about 90 individuals, and the parties, with the court\xe2\x80\x99s approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability.  The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, every prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from being impartial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In December 2005, three weeks before the trial date, one of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s co-defendants, Richard Causey, pleaded guilty.  Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.  The court again declined to move the trial, ruling that the questionnaires and <em>voir dire</em> provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.  The court also denied Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney-led <em>voir dire </em>on the ground that potential jurors were more forthcoming with judges than with lawyers.  But the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask follow-up questions, agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, and allotted the defendants jointly two extra peremptory challenges.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voir dire </em>began in January 2006.  After questioning the venire as a group, the court examined prospective jurors individually, asking each about her exposure to Enron-related news, the content of any stories that stood out in her mind, and any questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.  The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up questions and ruled on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 challenges for cause.  Ultimately, the court qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.  After a 4-month trial, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Skilling raised two arguments relevant here.  First, he contended that pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevented him from obtaining a fair trial.  Second, he alleged that the jury improperly convicted him of conspiracy to commit honest-services wire fraud.  As to the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice.  Stating, however, that the presumption is rebuttable, the court examined the <em>voir dire, </em>found it \xe2\x80\x9cproper and thorough,\xe2\x80\x9d and held that the District Court had empaneled an impartial jury.  The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud.  It did not address Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Pretrial publicity and community prejudice did not prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial.

S. 723</a>.  Wilbert Rideau robbed a small-town bank, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them.  Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession, which, without his knowledge, was filmed and televised three times to large local audiences shortly before trial.  After the Louisiana trial court denied Rideau\xe2\x80\x99s change-of-venue motion, he was convicted, and the conviction was upheld on direct appeal.  This Court reversed.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court explained, the interrogation \xe2\x80\x9cin a very real sense <em>was</em> Rideau\xe2\x80\x99s trial\xe2\x80\x94at which he pleaded guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d   <em>Id.,</em> at 726.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]ithout pausing to examine \xe2\x80\xa6 the <em>voir dire,</em>\xe2\x80\x9d the Court held that the \xe2\x80\x9ckangaroo court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d trailing the televised confession violated due process.  <em>Id.,</em> at 726\xe2\x80\x93727.  The Court followed <em>Rideau </em>in two other cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted criminal prosecutions.  However, it later explained that those decisions \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to \xe2\x80\xa6 news accounts of the crime \xe2\x80\xa6 alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murphy</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html">421 U. S. 794</a>, 798\xe2\x80\x93799.  Thus, prominence does not necessarily produce prejudice, and juror <em>impartiality</em> does not require <em>ignorance</em>.  See, <em>e.g., Irvin</em> v. <em>Dowd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/717/index.html">366 U. S. 717</a>, 722.  A presumption of prejudice attends only the extreme case.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Important differences separate Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution from those in which the Court has presumed juror prejudice.  First, the Court has emphasized the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.  In contrast to the small-town setting in <em>Rideau</em>, for example, the record shows that Houston is the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s fourth most populous city.  Given the large, diverse pool of residents eligible for jury duty, any suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled in Houston is hard to sustain.  Second, although news stories about Skilling were not kind, they contained no blatantly prejudicial information such as Rideau\xe2\x80\x99s dramatically staged admission of guilt.  Third, unlike <em>Rideau</em> and other cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, over four years elapsed between Enron\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy and Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts.  Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\xe2\x80\x99 actions run counter to that presumption.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit presumed juror prejudice based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of the media attention directed at Enron.  But \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial publicity\xe2\x80\x94even pervasive, adverse publicity\xe2\x80\x94does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nebraska Press Assn.</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/index.html">427 U. S. 539</a>, 554.  Here, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information the Court has recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston\xe2\x80\x99s size and diversity diluted the media\xe2\x80\x99s impact.  Nor did Enron\xe2\x80\x99s sheer number of victims trigger a presumption.  Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow-up <em>voir dire</em> yielded jurors whose links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.  Finally, while Causey\xe2\x80\x99s well publicized decision to plead guilty shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice, the District Court took appropriate steps to mitigate that risk.

The Court rejects Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that <em>voir dire </em>did not adequately detect and defuse juror prejudice and that several seated jurors were biased.

S. 589</a>, 594\xe2\x80\x93595.  When pretrial publicity is at issue, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cprimary reliance on the judgment of the trial court makes [especially] good sense\xe2\x80\x9d because the judge \xe2\x80\x9csits in the locale where the publicity is said to have had its effect\xe2\x80\x9d and may base her evaluation on her \xe2\x80\x9cown perception of the depth and extent of news stories that might influence a juror.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/415/index.html">500 U. S. 415</a>, 427.  The Court considers the adequacy of jury selection in Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s case attentive to the respect due to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9321. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Skilling failed to show that his <em>voir dire</em> fell short of constitutional requirements.  The jury-selection process was insufficient, Skilling maintains, because <em>voir dire </em>lasted only five hours, most of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s questions were conclusory and failed adequately to probe jurors\xe2\x80\x99 true feelings, and the court consistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter any other indications of bias.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.  The District Court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling.  That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions; <em>voir dire</em> thus was the culmination of a lengthy process.  Moreover, inspection of the questionnaires and <em>voir dire</em> of the seated jurors reveals that, notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process secured jurors largely uninterested in publicity about Enron and untouched by the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  Whatever community prejudice existed in Houston generally, Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jurors were not under its sway.  Relying on <em>Irvin</em> v. <em>Dowd</em>, 366 U. S., at 727\xe2\x80\x93728, Skilling asserts the District Court should not have accepted jurors\xe2\x80\x99 promises of fairness.  But a number of factors show that the District Court had far less reason than the trial court in <em>Irvin </em>to discredit jurors\xe2\x80\x99 assurances of impartiality: News stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Leslie Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s rampage of robberies and murders; Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s trial proceeded; circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in <em>Irvin; </em>and Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s seated jurors exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in <em>Irvin</em>.  In any event, the District Court did not simply take venire members at their word.  It questioned each juror individually to uncover concealed bias.  This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds, opinions, and news sources, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.

In reviewing such claims, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98A trial court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em>, 500 U. S., at 428.  Skilling, moreover, unsuccessfully challenged only one of the seated jurors for cause, \xe2\x80\x9cstrong evidence that he was convinced the [other] jurors were not biased and had not formed any opinions as to his guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/541/index.html">369 U. S. 541</a>, 557\xe2\x80\x93558.  A review of the record reveals no manifest error regarding the empaneling of Jurors 11, 20, and 63, each of whom indicated, <em>inter alia, </em>that he or she would be fair to Skilling and would require the Government to prove its case.  Four other jurors Skilling claims he would have excluded with extra peremptory strikes, Jurors 38, 67, 78, and 84, exhibited no signs of prejudice this Court can discern.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Shushan </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa02d 110, which stimulated the development of the \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.  Unlike traditional fraud, in which the victim\xe2\x80\x99s loss of money or property supplied the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, the honest-services doctrine targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.  While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment.  Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property gain for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that party\xe2\x80\x99s right to the offender\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chonest services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Most often these cases involved bribery of public officials, but over time, the courts increasingly recognized that the doctrine applied to a private employee who breached his allegiance to his employer, often by accepting bribes or kickbacks.  By 1982, all Courts of Appeals had embraced the honest-services theory of fraud.

But this Court must, if possible, construe, not condemn, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactments.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Letter Carriers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/index.html">413 U. S. 548</a>, 571.  Alert to \xc2\xa71346\xe2\x80\x99s potential breadth, the Courts of Appeals have divided on how best to interpret the statute.  Uniformly, however, they have declined to throw out the statute as irremediably vague.  This Court agrees that \xc2\xa71346 should be construed rather than invalidated.  P.\xc2\xa038\xe2\x80\x9339. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The Court looks to the doctrine developed in pre-<em>McNally </em>cases in an endeavor to ascertain the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cthe intangible right of honest services.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no doubt that Congress intended \xc2\xa71346 to refer to and incorporate the honest-services doctrine recognized in Courts of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions before <em>McNally</em> derailed the intangible-rights theory of fraud.  Congress, it bears emphasis, enacted \xc2\xa71346 on the heels of <em>McNally</em> and drafted the statute using that decision\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>terminology.  See 483 U. S., at 355, 362.  Pp. 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0To preserve what Congress certainly intended \xc2\xa71346 to cover, the Court pares the pre-<em>McNally</em> body of precedent down to its core: In the main, the pre-<em>McNally</em> cases involved fraudulent schemes to deprive another of honest services through bribes or kickbacks supplied by a third party who had not been deceived.  In parsing the various pre-<em>McNally </em>decisions, the Court acknowledges that Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness challenge has force, for honest-services decisions were not models of clarity or consistency.  It has long been the Court\xe2\x80\x99s practice, however, before striking a federal statute as impermissibly vague, to consider whether the prescription is amenable to a limiting construction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hooper</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/155/648/index.html">155 U. S. 648</a>, 657.  Arguing against any limiting construction, Skilling contends that it is impossible to identify a salvageable honest-services core because the pre-<em>McNally </em>cases are inconsistent and hopelessly unclear.  This Court rejected an argument of the same tenor in <em>Letter Carriers</em>, 413 U. S., at 571\xe2\x80\x93572.  Although some applications of the pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these decisions do not cloud the fact that the vast majority of cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes.  Indeed, <em>McNally</em> itself presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern.  483 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93353, 360.  In view of this history, there is no doubt that Congress intended \xc2\xa71346 to reach <em>at least</em> bribes and kickbacks.  Because reading the statute to proscribe a wider range of offensive conduct would raise vagueness concerns, the Court holds that \xc2\xa71346 criminalizes <em>only</em> the bribe-and-kickback core of the pre-<em>McNally </em>case law.  Pp.\xc2\xa041\xe2\x80\x9345. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(4)\xc2\xa0The Government urges the Court to go further by reading \xc2\xa71346 to proscribe another category of conduct: undisclosed self-dealing by a public official or private employee.  Neither of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in support of this position withstands close inspection.  Contrary to the first, <em>McNally</em> itself did not center on nondisclosure of a conflicting financial interest, but rather involved a classic kickback scheme.  See 483 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93353, 360.  Reading \xc2\xa71346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks\xe2\x80\x94and nothing more\xe2\x80\x94satisfies Congress\xe2\x80\x99 undoubted aim to reverse <em>McNally</em> on its facts.  Nor is the Court persuaded by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the pre-<em>McNally</em> conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine.  Although the Courts of Appeals upheld honest-services convictions for some conflict-of-interest schemes, they reached no consensus on which schemes qualified.  Given the relative infrequency of those prosecutions and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced, the Court concludes that a reasonable limiting construction of \xc2\xa71346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.  Further dispelling doubt on this point is the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cleveland</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/12/index.html">531 U. S. 12</a>, 25.  The Court therefore resists the Government\xe2\x80\x99s less constrained construction of \xc2\xa71346 absent Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clear instruction otherwise.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress desires to go further,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reiterates, \xe2\x80\x9cit must speak more clearly than it has.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McNally,</em> 483 U. S., at 360.  Pp.\xc2\xa045\xe2\x80\x9347.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(5)\xc2\xa0Interpreted to encompass only bribery and kickback schemes, \xc2\xa71346 is not unconstitutionally vague.  A prohibition on fraudulently depriving another of one\xe2\x80\x99s honest services by accepting bribes or kickbacks presents neither a fair-notice nor an arbitrary-prosecution problem.  See <em>Kolender</em>, 461 U. S., at 357.  As to fair notice, it has always been clear that bribes and kickbacks constitute honest-services fraud, <em>Williams</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/97/index.html">341 U. S. 97</a>, 101, and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>mens rea</em> requirement further blunts any notice concern, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Screws</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/325/91/index.html">325 U. S. 91</a>, 101\xe2\x80\x93104.  As to arbitrary prosecutions, the Court perceives no significant risk that the honest-services statute, as here interpreted, will be stretched out of shape.  Its prohibition on bribes and kickbacks draws content not only from the pre-<em>McNally</em> case law, but also from federal statutes proscribing and defining similar crimes.  Pp. 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Skilling did not violate \xc2\xa71346, as the Court interprets the statute.  The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enron\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders by misrepresenting the company\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal health to his own profit, but the Government never alleged that he solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.  Because the indictment alleged three objects of the conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94honest-services wire fraud, money-or-property wire fraud, and securities fraud\xe2\x80\x94Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s conviction is flawed.  See <em>Yates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/354/298/index.html">354 U. S. 298</a>.  This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction, for errors of the <em>Yates</em> variety are subject to harmless-error analysis.<em> </em>The Court leaves the parties\xe2\x80\x99 dispute about whether the error here was harmless for resolution on remand, along with the question whether reversal on the conspiracy count would touch any of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s other convictions.

SKILLING, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[June 24, 2010]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Ginsburg delivered the opinion of the Court. </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2001, Enron Corporation, then the seventh highest-revenue-grossing company in America, crashed into bankruptcy.  We consider in this opinion two questions arising from the prosecution of Jeffrey Skilling, a longtime Enron executive, for crimes committed before the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  First, did pretrial publicity and community prejudice prevent Skilling from obtaining a fair trial?  Second, did the jury improperly convict Skilling of conspiracy to commit \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services\xe2\x80\x9d wire fraud, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7371, 1343, 1346?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Answering no to both questions, the Fifth Circuit affirmed Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  We conclude, in common with the Court of Appeals, that Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial argument fails; Skilling, we hold, did not establish that a presumption of juror prejudice arose or that actual bias infected the jury that tried him.  But we disagree with the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s honest-services ruling.  In proscribing fraudulent deprivations of \xe2\x80\x9cthe intangible right of honest services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71346, Congress intended at least to reach schemes to defraud involving bribes and kickbacks.  Construing the honest-services statute to extend beyond that core meaning, we conclude, would encounter a vagueness shoal.  We therefore hold that \xc2\xa71346 covers only bribery and kickback schemes.  Because Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s alleged misconduct entailed no bribe or kickback, it does not fall within \xc2\xa71346\xe2\x80\x99s proscription.  We therefore affirm in part and vacate in part.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Founded in 1985, Enron Corporation grew from its headquarters in Houston, Texas, into one of the world\xe2\x80\x99s leading energy companies.  Skilling launched his career there in 1990 when Kenneth Lay, the company\xe2\x80\x99s founder, hired him to head an Enron subsidiary.  Skilling steadily rose through the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s ranks, serving as president and chief operating officer, and then, beginning in February 2001, as chief executive officer.  Six months later, on August 14, 2001, Skilling resigned from Enron.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Less than four months after Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s departure, Enron spiraled into bankruptcy.  The company\xe2\x80\x99s stock, which had traded at $90 per share in August 2000, plummeted to pennies per share in late 2001.  Attempting to comprehend what caused the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, the U. S. Department of Justice formed an Enron Task Force, comprising prosecutors and FBI agents from around the Nation.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s investigation uncovered an elaborate conspiracy to prop up Enron\xe2\x80\x99s short-run stock prices by overstating the company\xe2\x80\x99s financial well-being.  In the years following Enron\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy, the Government prosecuted dozens of Enron employees who participated in the scheme.  In time, the Government worked its way up the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s chain of command: On July 7, 2004, a grand jury indicted Skilling, Lay, and Richard Causey, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s former chief accounting officer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These three defendants, the indictment alleged,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cengaged in a wide-ranging scheme to deceive the investing public, including Enron\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders, \xe2\x80\xa6 about the true performance of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s businesses by: (a) manipulating Enron\xe2\x80\x99s publicly reported financial results; and (b) making public statements and representations about Enron\xe2\x80\x99s financial performance and results that were false and misleading.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. \xc2\xb65, p. 277a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nSkilling and his co-conspirators, the indictment continued, \xe2\x80\x9cenriched themselves as a result of the scheme through salary, bonuses, grants of stock and stock options, other profits, and prestige.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb614, at 280a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Count 1 of the indictment charged Skilling with conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud; in particular, it alleged that Skilling had sought to \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[e] Enron and its shareholders of the intangible right of [his] honest services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb687, at 318a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The indictment further charged Skilling with more than 25 substantive counts of securities fraud, wire fraud, making false representations to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s auditors, and insider trading.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2004, Skilling moved to transfer the trial to another venue; he contended that hostility toward him in Houston, coupled with extensive pretrial publicity, had poisoned potential jurors.  To support this assertion, Skilling, aided by media experts, submitted hundreds of news reports detailing Enron\xe2\x80\x99s downfall; he also presented affidavits from the experts he engaged portraying community attitudes in Houston in comparison to other potential venues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The U. S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas, in accord with rulings in two earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] denied the venue-transfer motion.  Despite \xe2\x80\x9cisolated incidents of intemperate commentary,\xe2\x80\x9d the court observed, media coverage \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] [mostly] been objective and unemotional,\xe2\x80\x9d and the facts of the case were \xe2\x80\x9cneither heinous nor sensational.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief for United States 10a\xe2\x80\x9311a.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9ccourts ha[d] commonly\xe2\x80\x9d favored \xe2\x80\x9ceffective voir dire \xe2\x80\xa6 to ferret out any [juror] bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 18a.  Pretrial publicity about the case, the court concluded, did not warrant a presumption that Skilling would be unable to obtain a fair trial in Houston.  <em>Id.</em>, at 22a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the months leading up to the trial, the District Court solicited from the parties questions the court might use to screen prospective jurors.  Unable to agree on a ques-\ntionnaire\xe2\x80\x99s format and content, Skilling and the Government submitted dueling documents.  On venire members\xe2\x80\x99 sources of Enron-related news, for example, the Government proposed that they tick boxes from a checklist of generic labels such as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]elevision,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ewspaper,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[r]adio,\xe2\x80\x9d Record 8415; Skilling proposed more probing questions asking venire members to list the specific names of their media sources and to report on \xe2\x80\x9cwhat st[ood] out in [their] mind[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9call the things [they] ha[d] seen, heard or read about Enron,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 8404\xe2\x80\x938405.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court rejected the Government\xe2\x80\x99s sparer inquiries in favor of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s submission.  Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s questions \xe2\x80\x9c[we]re more helpful,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [they] [we]re generally \xe2\x80\xa6 open-ended and w[ould] allow the potential jurors to give us more meaningful information.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at<em> </em>9539.  The court converted Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s submission, with slight modifications, into a 77-question, 14-page document that asked prospective jurors about, <em>inter alia</em>, their sources of news and exposure to Enron-related publicity, beliefs concerning Enron and what caused its collapse, opinions regarding the defendants and their possible guilt or innocence, and relationships to the company and to anyone affected by its demise.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2005, the District Court mailed the questionnaire to 400 prospective jurors and received responses from nearly all the addressees.  The court granted hardship exemptions to approximately 90 individuals, <em>id.,</em> at 11773\xe2\x80\x9311774, and the parties, with the court\xe2\x80\x99s approval, further winnowed the pool by excusing another 119 for cause, hardship, or physical disability, <em>id.</em>, at 11891, 13594.  The parties agreed to exclude, in particular, \xe2\x80\x9ceach and every\xe2\x80\x9d prospective juror who said that a preexisting opinion about Enron or the defendants would prevent her from impartially considering the evidence at trial.  <em>Id.,</em> at 13668.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 28, 2005, three weeks before the date scheduled for the commencement of trial, Causey pleaded guilty.  Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys immediately requested a continuance, and the District Court agreed to delay the proceedings until the end of January 2006.  <em>Id.,</em> at 14277.  In the interim, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that the juror questionnaires revealed pervasive bias and that news accounts of Causey\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea further tainted the jury pool.  If Houston remained the trial venue, Skilling urged that \xe2\x80\x9cjurors need to be questioned individually by both the Court <em>and</em> counsel\xe2\x80\x9d concerning their opinions of Enron and \xe2\x80\x9cpublicity issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 12074.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court again declined to move the trial.  Skilling, the court concluded, still had not \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed] that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise[d] a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 14115.  The questionnaires and <em>voir dire</em>, the court observed, provided safeguards adequate to ensure an impartial jury.  <em>Id.,</em> at 14115\xe2\x80\x9314116.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Denying Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney-led <em>voir dire</em>,<em> </em>the court said that in 17 years on the bench:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve found \xe2\x80\xa6 I get more forthcoming responses from potential jurors than the lawyers on either side.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know whether people are suspicious of lawyers\xe2\x80\x94but I think if I ask a person a question, I will get a candid response much easier than if a lawyer asks the question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 11805.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut the court promised to give counsel an opportunity to ask follow-up questions, <em>ibid.,</em> and it agreed that venire members should be examined individually about pretrial publicity, <em>id.,</em> at 11051\xe2\x80\x9311053.  The court also allotted the defendants jointly 14 peremptory challenges, 2 more than the standard number prescribed by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(b)(2) and (c)(4)(B).  <em>Id.,</em> at 13673\xe2\x80\x9313675.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Voir dire </em>began on January 30, 2006.  The District Court first emphasized to the venire the importance of impartiality and explained the presumption of innocence and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof.  The trial, the court next instructed, was not a forum \xe2\x80\x9cto seek vengeance against Enron\xe2\x80\x99s former officers,\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cprovide remedies for\xe2\x80\x9d its victims.  App. 823a.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe bottom line,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stressed, \xe2\x80\x9cis that we want \xe2\x80\xa6 jurors who \xe2\x80\xa6 will faithfully, conscientiously and impartially serve if selected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 823a\xe2\x80\x93824a.  In response to the court\xe2\x80\x99s query whether any prospective juror questioned her ability to adhere to these instructions, two individuals indicated that they could not be fair; they were therefore excused for cause, <em>id.</em>, at 816a, 819a\xe2\x80\x93820a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After questioning the venire as a group,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the District Court brought prospective jurors one by one to the bench for individual examination.  Although the questions varied, the process generally tracked the following format: The court asked about exposure to Enron-related news and the content of any stories that stood out in the prospective juror\xe2\x80\x99s mind.  Next, the court homed in on questionnaire answers that raised a red flag signaling possible bias.  The court then permitted each side to pose follow-up questions.  Finally, after the venire member stepped away, the court entertained and ruled on challenges for cause.  In all, the court granted one of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s for-\ncause challenges and denied four; it granted three of the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 challenges and denied six.  The parties agreed to excuse three additional jurors for cause and one for hardship.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the end of the day, the court had qualified 38 prospective jurors, a number sufficient, allowing for peremptory challenges, to empanel 12 jurors and 4 alternates.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Before the jury was sworn in, Skilling objected to the seating of six jurors.  He did not contend that they were in fact biased; instead, he urged that he would have used peremptories to exclude them had he not exhausted his supply by striking several venire members after the court refused to excuse them for cause.  Supp. App. 3sa\xe2\x80\x934sa (Sealed).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The court overruled this objection.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the jurors took their oath, the District Court told them they could not discuss the case with anyone or follow media accounts of the proceedings.  \xe2\x80\x9c[E]ach of you,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cneeds to be absolutely sure that your decisions concerning the facts will be based only on the evidence that you hear and read in this courtroom.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1026a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following a 4-month trial and nearly five days of deliberation, the jury found Skilling guilty of 19 counts, including the honest-services-fraud conspiracy charge, and not guilty of 9 insider-trading counts.

Regarding the former, the Fifth Circuit initially determined that the volume and negative tone of media coverage generated by Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse created a presumption of juror prejudice.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d 529, 559 (2009).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The court also noted potential prejudice stemming from Causey\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea and from the large number of victims in Houston\xe2\x80\x94from the \xe2\x80\x9c[t]housands of Enron employees \xe2\x80\xa6 [who] lost their jobs, and \xe2\x80\xa6 saw their 401(k) accounts wiped out,\xe2\x80\x9d to Houstonians who suffered spillover economic effects.  <em>Id.,</em> at 559\xe2\x80\x93560.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals stated, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption [of prejudice] is rebuttable,\xe2\x80\x9d and it therefore examined the <em>voir dire</em> to determine whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe District Court empanelled an impartial jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 561 (internal quotation marks, italics, and some capitalization omitted).  The <em>voir dire </em>was, in the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9cproper and thorough.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 562.  Moreover, the court noted, Skill-\ning had challenged only one seated juror\xe2\x80\x94Juror 11\xe2\x80\x94for cause.  Although Juror 11 made some troubling comments about corporate greed, the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cobserved [his] demeanor, listened to his answers, and believed he would make the government prove its case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 564.  In sum, the Fifth Circuit found that the Government had overcome the presumption of prejudice and that Skilling had not \xe2\x80\x9cshow[n] that any juror who actually sat was prejudiced against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also rejected Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his conduct did not indicate any conspiracy to commit honest-services fraud.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he jury was entitled to convict Skilling,\xe2\x80\x9d the court stated, \xe2\x80\x9con these elements\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) a material breach of a fiduciary duty \xe2\x80\xa6 (2) that results in a detriment to the employer,\xe2\x80\x9d including one occasioned by an employee\xe2\x80\x99s decision to \xe2\x80\x9cwithhold material information, i.e., information that he had reason to believe would lead a reasonable employer to change its conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 547.  The Fifth Circuit did not address Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the honest-services statute, if not interpreted to exclude his actions, should be invalidated as unconstitutionally vague.

Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial claim thus raises two distinct questions.  First, did the District Court err by failing to move the trial to a different venue based on a presumption of prejudice?

When does the publicity attending conduct charged as criminal dim prospects that the trier can judge a case, as due process requires, impartially, unswayed by outside influence?  Because most cases of consequence garner at least some pretrial publicity, courts have considered this question in diverse settings.  We begin our discussion by addressing the presumption of prejudice from which the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s case proceeded.  The foundation precedent is <em>Rideau</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/723/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/723/index.html">373 U. S. 723</a> (1963).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wilbert Rideau robbed a bank in a small Louisiana town, kidnaped three bank employees, and killed one of them.  Police interrogated Rideau in jail without counsel present and obtained his confession.  Without informing Rideau, no less seeking his consent, the police filmed the interrogation.  On three separate occasions shortly before the trial, a local television station broadcast the film to audiences ranging from 24,000 to 53,000 individuals.  Rideau moved for a change of venue, arguing that he could not receive a fair trial in the parish where the crime occurred, which had a population of approximately 150,000 people.  The trial court denied the motion, and a jury eventually convicted Rideau.  The Supreme Court of Louisiana upheld the conviction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reversed.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the people [in the community] saw on their television sets,\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwas Rideau, in jail, flanked by the sheriff and two state troopers, admitting in detail the commission of the robbery, kidnapping, and murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 725.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the tens of thousands of people who saw and heard it,\xe2\x80\x9d we explained, the interrogation \xe2\x80\x9cin a very real sense <em>was</em> Rideau\xe2\x80\x99s trial\xe2\x80\x94at which he pleaded guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 726.  We therefore \xe2\x80\x9cd[id] not hesitate to hold, without pausing to examine a particularized transcript of the <em>voir dire</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he kangaroo court proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d trailing the televised confession violated due process.  <em>Id.,</em> at 726\xe2\x80\x93727.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We followed <em>Rideau</em>\xe2\x80\x99s lead in two later cases in which media coverage manifestly tainted a criminal prosecution.  In <em>Estes</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/532/index.html"></a><a href="/us/381/532/index.html">381 U. S. 532</a>, 538 (1965), extensive publicity before trial swelled into excessive exposure during preliminary court proceedings as reporters and television crews overran the courtroom and \xe2\x80\x9cbombard[ed] \xe2\x80\xa6 the community with the sights and sounds of\xe2\x80\x9d the pretrial hearing.  The media\xe2\x80\x99s overzealous reporting efforts, we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cled to considerable disruption\xe2\x80\x9d and denied the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial serenity and calm to which [Billie Sol Estes] was entitled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 536.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly, in <em>Sheppard</em> v. <em>Maxwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/index.html"></a><a href="/us/384/333/index.html">384 U. S. 333</a> (1966), news reporters extensively covered the story of Sam Sheppard, who was accused of bludgeoning his pregnant wife to death.  \xe2\x80\x9c[B]edlam reigned at the courthouse during the trial and newsmen took over practically the entire courtroom,\xe2\x80\x9d thrusting jurors \xe2\x80\x9cinto the role of celebrities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 353, 355.  Pretrial media coverage, which we characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cmonths [of] virulent publicity about Sheppard and the murder,\xe2\x80\x9d did not alone deny due process, we noted.  <em>Id.,</em> at 354.  But Sheppard\xe2\x80\x99s case involved more than heated reporting pretrial: We upset the murder conviction because a \xe2\x80\x9ccarnival atmosphere\xe2\x80\x9d pervaded the trial, <em>id.,</em> at 358.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In each of these cases, we overturned a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction obtained in a trial atmosphere that [was] utterly corrupted by press coverage\xe2\x80\x9d; our decisions, however, \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be made to stand for the proposition that juror exposure to \xe2\x80\xa6 news accounts of the crime \xe2\x80\xa6 alone presumptively deprives the defendant of due process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murphy</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html">421 U.

We are not persuaded.  Important differences separate Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution from those in which we have presumed juror prejudice.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, we have emphasized in prior decisions the size and characteristics of the community in which the crime occurred.  In <em>Rideau</em>, for example, we noted that the murder was committed in a parish of only 150,000 residents.  Houston, in contrast, is the fourth most populous city in the Nation: At the time of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial, more than 4.5 million individuals eligible for jury duty resided in the Houston area.  App. 627a.  Given this large, diverse pool of potential jurors, the suggestion that 12 impartial individuals could not be empaneled is hard to sustain.  See <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/415/index.html"></a><a href="/us/500/415/index.html"></a><a href="/us/500/415/index.html">500 U. S. 415</a>, 429 (1991) (potential for prejudice mitigated by the size of the \xe2\x80\x9cmetropolitan Washington [D.\xc2\xa0C.] statistical area, which has a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed each year\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Gentile</em> v. <em>State Bar of Nev.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/1030/index.html">501 U.

Rideau\xe2\x80\x99s dramatically staged admission of guilt, for instance, was likely imprinted indelibly in the mind of anyone who watched it.  Cf. <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Randolph</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/62/index.html">442 U. S. 62</a>, 72 (1979) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own confession [is] probably the most probative and damaging evidence that can be admitted against him.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Pretrial publicity about Skilling was less memorable and prejudicial.  No evidence of the smoking-gun variety invited prejudgment of his culpability.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Chagra</em>, 669 F.\xc2\xa02d 241, 251\xe2\x80\x93252, n.\xc2\xa011 (CA5 1982) (\xe2\x80\x9cA jury may have difficulty in disbelieving or forgetting a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s opinion of his own guilt but have no difficulty in rejecting the opinions of others because they may not be well-founded.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, unlike cases in which trial swiftly followed a widely reported crime, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Rideau</em>, 373 U. S., at 724, over four years elapsed between Enron\xe2\x80\x99s bankruptcy and Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Although reporters covered Enron-related news throughout this period, the decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat in the years following Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  See App. 700a; <em>id.</em>, at 785a; <em>Yount</em>, 467 U. S., at 1032, 1034.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, and of prime significance, Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury acquitted him of nine insider-trading counts.  Similarly, earlier instituted Enron-related prosecutions yielded no overwhelming victory for the Government.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In <em>Rideau</em>, <em>Estes</em>, and <em>Sheppard</em>, in marked contrast, the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict did not undermine in any way the supposition of juror bias.  It would be odd for an appellate court to presume prejudice in a case in which jurors\xe2\x80\x99 actions run counter to that presumption.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Arzola-Amaya</em>, 867 F.\xc2\xa02d 1504, 1514 (CA5 1989) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe jury\xe2\x80\x99s ability to discern a failure of proof of guilt of some of the alleged crimes indicates a fair minded consideration of the issues and reinforces our belief and conclusion that the media coverage did not lead to the deprivation of [the] right to an impartial trial.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">4</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial, in short, shares little in common with those in which we approved a presumption of juror prejudice.  The Fifth Circuit reached the opposite conclusion based primarily on the magnitude and negative tone of media attention directed at Enron.  But \xe2\x80\x9cpretrial publicity\xe2\x80\x94even pervasive, adverse publicity\xe2\x80\x94does not inevitably lead to an unfair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nebraska Press Assn.</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/index.html"></a><a href="/us/427/539/index.html">427 U. S. 539</a>, 554 (1976).  In this case, as just noted, news stories about Enron did not present the kind of vivid, unforgettable information we have recognized as particularly likely to produce prejudice, and Houston\xe2\x80\x99s size and diversity diluted the media\xe2\x80\x99s impact.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did Enron\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csheer number of victims,\xe2\x80\x9d 554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 560, trigger a presumption of prejudice.  Although the widespread community impact necessitated careful identification and inspection of prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 connections to Enron, the extensive screening questionnaire and follow-up <em>voir dire</em> were well suited to that task.  And hindsight shows the efficacy of these devices; as we discuss <em>infra</em>,\nat 24, jurors\xe2\x80\x99 links to Enron were either nonexistent or attenuated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, although Causey\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cwell-publicized decision to plead guilty\xe2\x80\x9d shortly before trial created a danger of juror prejudice, 554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 559, the District Court took appropriate steps to reduce that risk.  The court delayed the proceedings by two weeks, lessening the immediacy of that development.  And during <em>voir dire</em>, the court asked about prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to recent publicity, including news regarding Causey.  Only two venire members recalled the plea; neither mentioned Causey by name, and neither ultimately served on Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury.  App. 888a, 993a.  Although publicity about a codefendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea calls for inquiry to guard against actual prejudice, it does not ordinarily\xe2\x80\x94and, we are satisfied, it did not here\xe2\x80\x94warrant an automatic presumption of prejudice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Persuaded that no presumption arose,[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] we conclude that the District Court, in declining to order a venue change, did not exceed constitutional limitations.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider whether actual prejudice infected Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury.  <em>Voir dire</em>, Skilling asserts, did not adequately detect and defuse juror bias.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he record \xe2\x80\xa6 affirmatively confirm[s]\xe2\x80\x9d prejudice, he maintains, because several seated jurors \xe2\x80\x9cprejudged his guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 21.

See <em>Reynolds</em>, 98 U. S., at 156\xe2\x80\x93157.  In contrast to the cold transcript received by the appellate court, the in-the-moment <em>voir dire</em> affords the trial court a more intimate and immediate basis for assessing a venire member\xe2\x80\x99s fitness for jury service.  We consider the adequacy of jury selection in Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s case, therefore, attentive to the respect due to district-court determinations of juror impartiality and of the measures necessary to ensure that impartiality.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skilling deems the <em>voir dire</em> insufficient because, he argues, jury selection lasted \xe2\x80\x9cjust five hours,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost of the court\xe2\x80\x99s questions were conclusory[,] high-level, and failed adequately to probe jurors\xe2\x80\x99 true feelings,\xe2\x80\x9d and the court \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently took prospective jurors at their word once they claimed they could be fair, no matter what other indications of bias were present.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 10\xe2\x80\x9311 (emphasis deleted).  Our review of the record, however, yields a different appraisal.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x936, and n.\xc2\xa04, the District Court initially screened venire members by eliciting their responses to a comprehensive questionnaire drafted in large part by Skilling.  That survey helped to identify prospective jurors excusable for cause and served as a springboard for further questions put to remaining members of the array.  <em>Voir dire</em> thus was, in the court\xe2\x80\x99s words, the \xe2\x80\x9cculmination of a lengthy process.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 841a; see 554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 562, n.\xc2\xa051 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe consider the \xe2\x80\xa6 questionnaire in assessing the quality of <em>voir dire</em> as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In other Enron-related prosecutions, we note, District Courts, after inspecting venire members\xe2\x80\x99 responses to questionnaires, completed the jury-selection process within one day.

At Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s urging, the court examined each prospective juror individually, thus preventing the spread of any prejudicial information to other venire members.  See <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em>, 500 U. S., at 425.  To encourage candor, the court repeatedly admonished that there were \xe2\x80\x9cno right and wrong answers to th[e] questions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.,</em> App. 843a.  The court denied Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s request for attorney-led <em>voir dire</em> because, in its experience, potential jurors were \xe2\x80\x9cmore forthcoming\xe2\x80\x9d when the court, rather than counsel, asked the question.  Record 11805.  The parties, however, were accorded an opportunity to ask follow-up questions of every prospective juror brought to the bench for colloquy.  Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s counsel declined to ask anything of more than half of the venire members questioned individually, including eight eventually selected for the jury, because, he explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Court and other counsel have covered\xe2\x80\x9d everything he wanted to know.  App. 967a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Inspection of the questionnaires and <em>voir dire</em> of the individuals who actually served as jurors satisfies us that, notwithstanding the flaws Skilling lists, the selection process successfully secured jurors who were largely untouched by Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Eleven of the seated jurors and alternates reported no connection at all to Enron, while all other jurors reported at most an insubstantial link.

I cannot remember his name.\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  As for pretrial publicity, 14 jurors and alternates specifically stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron-related news.

When asked whether they \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] an opinion about \xe2\x80\xa6 Jeffrey Skilling,\xe2\x80\x9d none of the seated jurors and alternates checked the \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d box.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  And in response to the question whether \xe2\x80\x9cany opinion [they] may have formed regarding Enron or [Skilling] [would] prevent\xe2\x80\x9d their impartial consideration of the evidence at trial, every juror\xe2\x80\x94despite options to mark \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunsure\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94instead checked \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, Skilling asserts, should not have \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed] <em>at face value</em> jurors\xe2\x80\x99 promises of fairness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 37.  In <em>Irvin</em> v. <em>Dowd</em>, 366 U. S., at 727\xe2\x80\x93728, Skilling points out, we found actual prejudice despite jurors\xe2\x80\x99 assurances that they could be impartial.  Brief for Petitioner 26.  Justice Sotomayor, in turn, repeatedly relies on <em>Irvin</em>, which she regards as closely analogous to this case.  See <em>post</em>, at 23 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part) (hereinafter dissent).  See also, <em>e.g., post</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 33, 35, 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  We disagree with that characterization of <em>Irvin</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The facts of <em>Irvin</em> are worlds apart from those presented here.  Leslie Irvin stood accused of a brutal murder and robbery spree in a small rural community.  366 U. S., at 719.  In the months before Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s trial, \xe2\x80\x9ca barrage\xe2\x80\x9d of publicity was \xe2\x80\x9cunleashed against him,\xe2\x80\x9d including reports of his confessions to the slayings and robberies.  <em>Id.,</em> at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of the media coverage in <em>Irvin</em> reveals why the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbest case\xe2\x80\x9d is not an apt comparison:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tories revealed the details of [Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s] background, including a reference to crimes committed when a juvenile, his convictions for arson almost 20 years previously, for burglary and by a court-martial on AWOL charges during the war.  He was accused of being a parole violator.  The headlines announced his police line-up identification, that he faced a lie detector test, had been placed at the scene of the crime and that the six murders were solved but [he] refused to confess.  Finally, they announced [Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s] confession to the six murders and the fact of his indictment for four of them in Indiana.  They reported [Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s] offer to plead guilty if promised a 99-year sentence, but also the determination, on the other hand, of the prosecutor to secure the death penalty, and that [Irvin] had confessed to 24 burglaries (the <em>modus operandi</em> of these robberies was compared to that of the murders and the similarity noted).  One story dramatically relayed the promise of a sheriff to devote his life to securing [Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s] execution \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Another characterized [Irvin] as remorseless and without conscience but also as having been found sane by a court-appointed panel of doctors.  In many of the stories [Irvin] was described as the \xe2\x80\x98confessed slayer of six,\xe2\x80\x99 a parole violator and fraudulent-check artist.  [Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s] court-appointed counsel was quoted as having received \xe2\x80\x98much criticism over being Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99 and it was pointed out, by way of excusing the attorney, that he would be subject to disbarment should he refuse to represent Irvin.  On the day before the trial the newspapers carried the story that Irvin had orally admitted [to] the murder of [one victim] as well as \xe2\x80\x98the robbery-murder of [a second individual]; the murder of [a third individual], and the slaughter of three members of [a different family].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 725\xe2\x80\x93726.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xe2\x80\x9c[N]ewspapers in which the[se] stories appeared were delivered regularly to 95% of the dwellings in\xe2\x80\x9d the county where the trial occurred, which had a population of only 30,000; \xe2\x80\x9cradio and TV stations, which likewise blanketed that county, also carried extensive newscasts covering the same incidents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 725.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reviewing Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial claim, this Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d in the community \xe2\x80\x9cwas clearly reflected in the sum total of the <em>voir dire</em>\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c370 prospective jurors or almost 90% of those examined on the point \xe2\x80\xa6 entertained some opinion as to guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[8] out of the 12 [jurors] thought [Irvin] was guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although these jurors declared they could be impartial, we held that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ith his life at stake, it is not requiring too much that [Irvin] be tried in an atmosphere undisturbed by so huge a wave of public passion and by a jury other than one in which two-thirds of the members admit, before hearing any testimony, to possessing a belief in his guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 728.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, as noted, <em>supra</em>, at 17, news stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s rampage of robberies and murders.  Of key importance, Houston shares little in common with the rural community in which Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s trial proceeded, and circulation figures for Houston media sources were far lower than the 95% saturation level recorded in <em>Irvin</em>, see App. to Brief for United States 15a (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Houston Chronicle</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 reaches less than one-third of occupied households in Houston.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s seated jurors, moreover, exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in <em>Irvin</em>.  See <em>supra</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9326 (noting, <em>inter alia</em>, that none of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jurors answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d when asked if they \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] an opinion about \xe2\x80\xa6 Skilling\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>post</em>, at 19 (dissent) (distinguishing <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min </em>from <em>Irvin</em> on similar bases: the \xe2\x80\x9coffense occurred in [a large] metropolitan \xe2\x80\xa6 area,\xe2\x80\x9d media \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage was not as pervasive as in <em>Irvin</em> and did not contain the same sort of damaging information,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  In light of these large differences, the District Court had far less reason than did the trial court in <em>Irvin </em>to discredit jurors\xe2\x80\x99 promises of fairness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court, moreover, did not simply take venire members who proclaimed their impartiality at their word.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  As noted, all of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jurors had already affirmed on their questionnaires that they would have no trouble basing a verdict only on the evidence at trial.  Nevertheless, the court followed up with each individually to uncover concealed bias.  This face-to-face opportunity to gauge demeanor and credibility, coupled with information from the questionnaires regarding jurors\xe2\x80\x99 backgrounds, opinions, and sources of news, gave the court a sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.  See 554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 562 (The District Court made \xe2\x80\x9cthorough\xe2\x80\x9d credibility determinations that \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ed] more than just the [venire members\xe2\x80\x99] statements that [they] could be fair.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The jury\xe2\x80\x99s not-guilty verdict on nine insider-trading counts after nearly five days of deliberation, meanwhile, suggests the court\xe2\x80\x99s assessments were accurate.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Haldeman</em>, 559 F.\xc2\xa02d 31, 60, n. 28 (CADC 1976).[<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Skilling, we conclude, failed to show that his <em>voir dire</em> fell short of constitutional requirements.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skilling also singles out several jurors in particular and contends they were openly biased.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Salazar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/304/index.html"></a><a href="/us/528/304/index.html">528 U.

In reviewing claims of this type, the deference due to district courts is at its pinnacle: \xe2\x80\x9cA trial court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of juror impartiality may be overturned only for manifest error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em>, 500 U.

With these considerations in mind, we turn to Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s specific allegations of juror partiality.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skilling contends that Juror 11\xe2\x80\x94the only seated juror he challenged for cause\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexpressed the most obvious bias.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 35.

He also asserted that he could be fair and require the government to prove its case, that he did not believe everything he read in the paper, that he did not \xe2\x80\x98get into the details\xe2\x80\x99 of the Enron coverage, that he did not watch television, and that Enron was \xe2\x80\x98old news.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 563\xe2\x80\x93564.</p>\n<p align="left">\nDespite his criticism of greed, Juror 11 remarked that Skilling \xe2\x80\x9cearned [his] salar[y],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 857a, and said he would have \xe2\x80\x9cno problem\xe2\x80\x9d telling his co-worker, who had lost 401(k) funds due to Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, that the jury voted to acquit, if that scenario came to pass, <em>id.,</em> at 854a.

In light of these answers, the District Court did not commit manifest error in finding Juror 20 fit for jury service.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same is true of Juror 63, who, Skilling points out, wrote on her questionnaire \xe2\x80\x9cthat [Skilling] \xe2\x80\x98probably knew [he] w[as] breaking the law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief 13.

S. 350</a>, 356 (1987).  In 1909, Congress amended the statute to prohibit, as it does today, \xe2\x80\x9cany scheme or artifice to defraud, <em>or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71341 (emphasis added); see <em>id.</em>, at 357\xe2\x80\x93358.  Emphasizing Congress\xe2\x80\x99 disjunctive phrasing, the Courts of Appeals, one after the other, interpreted the term \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d to include deprivations not only of money or property, but also of intangible rights.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an opinion credited with first presenting the intangible-rights theory, <em>Shushan </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 117 F.\xc2\xa02d 110 (1941),<em> </em>the Fifth Circuit reviewed the mail-fraud prosecution of a public official who allegedly accepted bribes from entrepreneurs in exchange for urging city action beneficial to the bribe payers.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not true that because the [city] was to make and did make a saving by the operations there could not have been an intent to defraud,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals maintained.  <em>Id.,</em> at 119.  \xe2\x80\x9cA scheme to get a public contract on more favorable terms than would likely be got otherwise by bribing a public official,\xe2\x80\x9d the court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not only be a plan to commit the crime of bribery, but would also be a scheme to defraud the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 115.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Shushan</em> stimulated the development of an \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.  Unlike fraud in which the victim\xe2\x80\x99s loss of money or property supplied the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s gain, with one the mirror image of the other, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Starr</em>, 816 F.\xc2\xa02d 94, 101 (CA2 1987), the honest-services theory targeted corruption that lacked similar symmetry.  While the offender profited, the betrayed party suffered no deprivation of money or property; instead, a third party, who had not been deceived, provided the enrichment.  For example, if a city mayor (the offender) accepted a bribe from a third party in exchange for awarding that party a city contract, yet the contract terms were the same as any that could have been negotiated at arm\xe2\x80\x99s length, the city (the betrayed party) would suffer no tangible loss.  Cf. <em>McNally</em>, 483 U. S., at 360.  Even if the scheme occasioned a money or property <em>gain </em>for the betrayed party, courts reasoned, actionable harm lay in the denial of that party\xe2\x80\x99s right to the offender\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chonest services.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, 536 F.\xc2\xa02d 1388, 1400 (CA2 1976).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMost often these cases \xe2\x80\xa6 involved bribery of public officials,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bohonus</em>, 628 F.\xc2\xa02d 1167, 1171 (CA9 1980), but courts also recognized private-sector honest-services fraud.

The prosecutor did not charge that, \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of the alleged scheme[,] the Commonwealth would have paid a lower premium or secured better insurance.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em>  Instead, the prosecutor maintained that the kickback scheme \xe2\x80\x9cdefraud[ed] the citizens and government of Kentucky of their right to have the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s affairs conducted honestly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 353.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We held that the scheme did not qualify as mail fraud.  \xe2\x80\x9cRather than constru[ing] the statute in a manner that leaves its outer boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials,\xe2\x80\x9d we read the statute \xe2\x80\x9cas limited in scope to the protection of property rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 360.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress desires to go further,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cit must speak more clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress responded swiftly.

Although some applications of the pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services doctrine occasioned disagreement among the Courts of Appeals, these cases do not cloud the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s solid core: The \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority\xe2\x80\x9d of the honest-services cases involved offenders who, in violation of a fiduciary duty, participated in bribery or kickback schemes.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Runnels</em>, 833 F.\xc2\xa02d 1183, 1187 (CA6 1987); see Brief for United States 42, and n. 4 (citing dozens of examples).[<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Indeed, the <em>McNally</em> case itself, which spurred Congress to enact \xc2\xa71346, presented a paradigmatic kickback fact pattern.  483 U.

McNally</em>, as we have already observed, <em>supra</em>, at 37, 43, involved a classic kickback scheme: A public official, in exchange for routing Kentucky\xe2\x80\x99s insurance business through a middleman company, arranged for that company to share its commissions with entities in which the official held an interest.  483 U. S., at 352\xe2\x80\x93353, 360.  This was no mere failure to disclose a conflict of interest; rather, the official conspired with a third party so that both would profit from wealth generated by public contracts.  See <em>id.</em>, at 352\xe2\x80\x93353.  Reading \xc2\xa71346 to proscribe bribes and kickbacks\xe2\x80\x94and nothing more\xe2\x80\x94satisfies Congress\xe2\x80\x99 undoubted aim to reverse <em>McNally</em> on its facts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor are we persuaded that the pre-<em>McNally</em> conflict-of-interest cases constitute core applications of the honest-services doctrine.

In light of the relative infrequency of conflict-of-interest prosecutions in comparison to bribery and kickback charges, and the intercircuit inconsistencies they produced, we conclude that a reasonable limiting construction of \xc2\xa71346 must exclude this amorphous category of cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further dispelling doubt on this point is the familiar principle that \xe2\x80\x9cambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cleveland</em>, 531 U.

Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s honest-services prosecution, the Government concedes, was not \xe2\x80\x9cprototypical.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 49.  The Government charged Skilling with conspiring to defraud Enron\xe2\x80\x99s shareholders by misrepresenting the company\xe2\x80\x99s fiscal health, thereby artificially inflating its stock price.  It was the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory at trial that Skilling \xe2\x80\x9cprofited from the fraudulent scheme \xe2\x80\xa6 through the receipt of salary and bonuses, \xe2\x80\xa6 and through the sale of approximately $200 million in Enron stock, which netted him $89 million.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 51.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government did not, at any time, allege that Skilling solicited or accepted side payments from a third party in exchange for making these misrepresentations.  See Record 41328 (May 11, 2006 Letter from the Government to the District Court) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he indictment does not allege, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence did not show, that [Skilling] engaged in bribery.\xe2\x80\x9d).

S. 298</a>\n(1957) (constitutional error occurs when a jury is instructed on alternative theories of guilt and returns a general verdict that may rest on a legally invalid theory).  This determination, however, does not necessarily require reversal of the conspiracy conviction; we recently confirmed, in <em>Hedgpeth</em> v. <em>Pulido</em>, 555 U. S. ___ (2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>, that errors of the <em>Yates</em> variety are subject to harmless-error analysis.<em> </em>The parties vigorously dispute whether the error was harmless.  Compare Brief for United States 52 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny juror who voted for conviction based on [the honest-services theory] also would have found [Skilling] guilty of conspiring to commit securities fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d) with Reply Brief 30 (The Government \xe2\x80\x9ccannot show that the conspiracy conviction rested <em>only</em> on the securities-fraud theory, rather than the distinct, legally-flawed honest-services theory.\xe2\x80\x9d).

See <em>United States</em> v. <em>McVeigh</em>, 918 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1467, 1474 (WD Okla. 1996).  They have also exercised discretion to deny venue-transfer requests in cases involving substantial pretrial publicity and community impact, for example, the prosecutions resulting from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salameh</em>, No.\xc2\xa0S5 93 Cr.\xc2\xa00180 (KTD) (SDNY, Sept. 15, 1993); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Yousef</em>, No.\xc2\xa0S12 93 Cr.\xc2\xa0180 (KTD) (SDNY, July 18, 1997), aff\xe2\x80\x99d 327 F.\xc2\xa03d 56, 155 (CA2 2003), and the prosecution of John Walker Lindh, referred to in the press as the American Taliban, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lindh</em>, 212 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 541, 549\xe2\x80\x93551 (ED Va. 2002).

I therefore join Parts I and II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  I also agree that the decision upholding Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for so-called \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services fraud\xe2\x80\x9d must be reversed, but for a different reason.  In my view, the specification in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71346 (2006 ed., Supp. II) that \xe2\x80\x9cscheme or artifice to defraud\xe2\x80\x9d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341 and 1343 (2006 ed.), includes \xe2\x80\x9ca scheme or artifice to deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,\xe2\x80\x9d is vague, and therefore violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Court strikes a pose of judicial humility in proclaiming that our task is \xe2\x80\x9cnot to destroy the Act \xe2\x80\xa6 but to construe it,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 43 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But in transforming the prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9chonest-services fraud\xe2\x80\x9d into a prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cbribery and kick-backs\xe2\x80\x9d it is wielding a power we long ago abjured: the power to define new federal crimes.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hudson,</em> 7 Cranch 32, 34 (1812).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A criminal statute must clearly define the conduct it proscribes, see <em>Grayned</em> v. <em>City of Rockford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/104/index.html">408 U. S. 104</a>, 108 (1972).  A statute that is unconstitutionally vague cannot be saved by a more precise indictment, see <em>Lanzetta</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/306/451/index.html">306 U. S. 451</a>, 453 (1939), nor by judicial construction that writes in specific criteria that its text does not contain, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Reese</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/92/214/index.html">92 U. S. 214</a>, 219\xe2\x80\x93221 (1876).  Our cases have described vague statutes as failing \xe2\x80\x9cto provide a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice of what is prohibited, or [as being] so standardless that [they] authoriz[e] or encourag[e] seriously discriminatory enforcement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/285/index.html">553 U. S. 285</a>, 304 (2008).  Here, Skilling argues that \xc2\xa71346 fails to provide fair notice and encourages arbitrary enforcement because it provides no definition of the right of honest services whose deprivation it prohibits.  Brief for Petitioner 38\xe2\x80\x9339, 42\xe2\x80\x9344.  In my view Skilling is correct.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court maintains that \xe2\x80\x9cthe intangible right of honest services\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d means the right not to have one\xe2\x80\x99s fiduciaries accept \xe2\x80\x9cbribes or kickbacks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Its first step in reaching that\xc2\xa0conclusion is the assertion that the phrase refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe doctrine developed\xe2\x80\x9d in cases decided by lower federal courts prior to our decision in <em>McNally </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/350/index.html">483 U. S. 350</a> (1987).  <em>Ante</em>, at 39.  I do not contest that.  I agree that Congress used the novel phrase to adopt the lower-court case law that had been disapproved by <em>McNally</em>\xe2\x80\x94what the Court calls \xe2\x80\x9cthe pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 43.  The problem is that that doctrine provides no \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable standard of guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States </em>v. <em>L. Cohen Grocery Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/255/81/index.html"></a><a href="/us/255/81/index.html">255 U. S. 81</a>, 89 (1921), and certainly is not limited to \xe2\x80\x9cbribes or kickbacks.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Investigation into the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cthe pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d might logically begin with <em>McNally</em> itself, which rejected it.  That case repudiated the many Court of Appeals holdings that had expanded the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d in the mail-fraud and wire-fraud statutes beyond deceptive schemes to obtain property. <em> </em>483 U. S., at 360.  If the repudiated cases stood for a prohibition of \xe2\x80\x9cbribery and kickbacks,\xe2\x80\x9d one would have expected those words to appear in the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s description of the cases.  In fact, they do not.  <em>Not at all</em>.  Nor did <em>McNally</em> even provide a consistent definition of the pre-existing theory of fraud it rejected.  It referred variously to a right of citizens \xe2\x80\x9cto have the [State]\xe2\x80\x99s affairs conducted honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 353, to \xe2\x80\x9chonest and impartial government,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 355, to \xe2\x80\x9cgood government,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 356, and \xe2\x80\x9cto have public officials perform their duties honestly,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 358.  It described prior case law as holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca public official owes a fiduciary duty to the public, and misuse of his office for private gain is a fraud,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 355.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the pre-<em>McNally </em>Court of Appeals opinions were not limited to fraud by public officials.  Some courts had held that those fiduciaries subject to the \xe2\x80\x9chonest services\xe2\x80\x9d obligation included private individuals who merely participated in public decisions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gray</em>, 790 F.\xc2\xa02d 1290, 1295\xe2\x80\x931296 (CA6 1986) (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Margiotta</em>, 688 F.\xc2\xa02d 108, 122 (CA2 1982)), and even private employees who had no role in public decisions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lemire</em>, 720 F.\xc2\xa02d 1327, 1335\xe2\x80\x931336 (CADC 1983); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Von Barta</em>, 635 F.\xc2\xa02d 999, 1007 (CA2 1980).  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cto say that a man is a fiduciary only begins [the] analysis; it gives direction to further inquiry\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  What obligations does he owe as a fiduciary?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>SEC </em>v. <em>Chenery Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/318/80/index.html">318 U. S. 80</a>, 85\xe2\x80\x9386 (1943).  None of the \xe2\x80\x9chonest services\xe2\x80\x9d cases, neither those pertaining to public officials nor those pertaining to private employees, defined the nature and content of the fiduciary duty central to the \xe2\x80\x9cfraud\xe2\x80\x9d offense.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There was not even universal agreement concerning the <em>source </em>of the fiduciary obligation\xe2\x80\x94whether it must be positive state or federal law, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Rabbitt</em>, 583 F.\xc2\xa02d 1014, 1026 (CA8 1978), or merely general principles, such as the \xe2\x80\x9cobligations of loyalty and fidelity\xe2\x80\x9d that inhere in the \xe2\x80\x9cemployment relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Lemire</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1336.  The decision <em>McNally</em> reversed had grounded the duty in general (not jurisdiction-specific) trust law, see <em>Gray</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1294, a <em>corpus juris</em> festooned with various duties.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Restatement (Second) of Trusts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7169\xe2\x80\x93185 (1976).  Another pre-<em>McNally</em> case referred to the general law of agency, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ballard</em>, 663 F.\xc2\xa02d 534, 543, n. 22 (CA5 1981), modified on other grounds by 680 F.\xc2\xa02d 352 (1982), which imposes duties quite different from those of a trustee.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  See Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7377\xe2\x80\x93398 (1957).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This indeterminacy does not disappear if one assumes that the pre-<em>McNally</em> cases developed a federal, common-law fiduciary duty; the duty remained hopelessly undefined.  Some courts described it in astoundingly broad language.  <em>Blachly</em> v. <em>United States, </em>380 F.\xc2\xa02d 665 (CA5 1967), loftily declared that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]aw puts its imprimatur on the accepted moral standards and condemns conduct which fails to match the \xe2\x80\x98reflection of moral uprightness, of fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing in the general and business life of members of society.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 671 (quoting <em>Gregory</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 253 F.\xc2\xa02d 104, 109 (CA5 1958)).  Other courts unhelpfully added that any scheme \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to public policy\xe2\x80\x9d was also condemned by the statute, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bohonus</em>, 628 F.\xc2\xa02d 1167, 1171 (CA9 1980).  See also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mandel</em>, 591 F.\xc2\xa02d 1347, 1361 (CA4 1979) (any scheme that is \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to public policy and conflicts with accepted standards of moral uprightness, fundamental honesty, fair play and right dealing\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even opinions that did not indulge in such grandiloquence did not specify the duty at issue beyond loyalty or honesty, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Von Barta</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1005\xe2\x80\x931006.  Moreover, the demands of the duty were said to be greater for public officials than for private employees, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Lemire</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1337, n.\xc2\xa013; <em>Ballard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 541, n.\xc2\xa017, but in what respects (or by how much) was never made clear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The indefiniteness of the fiduciary duty is not all.  Many courts held that some <em>je-ne-sais-quoi </em>beyond a mere breach of fiduciary duty was needed to establish honest-services fraud.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Von Barta</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1006 (collecting cases); <em>United States </em>v. <em>George</em>, 477 F.\xc2\xa02d 508, 512 (CA7 1973).  There was, unsurprisingly, some dispute about that, at least in the context of acts by persons owing duties to the public.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Price,</em> 788 F.\xc2\xa02d 234, 237 (CA4 1986).  And even among those courts that did require something additional where a public official was involved, there was disagreement as to what the addition should be.  For example, in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bush</em>, 522 F.\xc2\xa02d 641 (1975), the Seventh Circuit held that material misrepresentations and active concealment were enough, <em>id.,</em> at 647\xe2\x80\x93648.  But in <em>Rabbitt</em>, 583 F.\xc2\xa02d 1014, the Eighth Circuit held that actual harm to the State was needed, <em>id.,</em> at 1026.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similar disagreements occurred with respect to private employees.  Courts disputed whether the defendant must use his fiduciary position for his own gain.  Compare <em>Lemire,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 1335 (yes), with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Bronston</em>, 658 F.\xc2\xa02d 920, 926 (CA2 1981) (no).  One opinion upheld a mail-fraud conviction on the ground that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to disclose his receipt of kickbacks and consulting fees from [his employer\xe2\x80\x99s] suppliers resulted in a breach of his fiduciary duties depriving his employer of his loyal and honest services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Bryza</em>, 522 F.\xc2\xa02d 414, 422 (CA7 1975).  Another opinion, however, demanded more than an intentional failure to disclose: \xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a failure to disclose something which in the knowledge or contemplation of the employee poses an independent business risk to the employer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lemire</em>, 720 F. 2d, at 1337.  Other courts required that the victim suffer some loss, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ballard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 541\xe2\x80\x93542\xe2\x80\x94a proposition that, of course, other courts rejected, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v<em>. Newman</em>, 664 F.\xc2\xa02d 12, 20 (CA2 1981); <em>United States </em>v.<em> O\xe2\x80\x99Malley</em>, 535 F.\xc2\xa02d 589, 592 (CA10 1976).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement today that there was a deprivation of honest services even if \xe2\x80\x9cthe scheme occasioned a money or property <em>gain</em> for the betrayed party,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 36, is therefore true, except to the extent it is not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the first step in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis\xe2\x80\x94holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe intangible right of honest services\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe honest-services doctrine recognized in Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decisions before <em>McNally</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 40\xe2\x80\x94is a step out of the frying pan into the fire.  The pre-<em>McNally</em> cases provide no clear indication of what constitutes a denial of the right of honest services.  The possibilities range from any action that is contrary to public policy or otherwise immoral, to only the disloyalty of a public official or employee to his principal, to only the secret use of a perpetrator\xe2\x80\x99s position of trust in order to harm whomever he is beholden to.  The duty probably did not have to be rooted in state law, but maybe it did.  It might have been more demanding in the case of public officials, but perhaps not.  At the time \xc2\xa71346 was enacted there was no settled criterion for choosing among these options, for conclusively settling what was in and what was out.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is aware of all this.  It knows that adopting by reference \xe2\x80\x9cthe pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services doctrine,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 43, is adopting by reference nothing more precise than the referring term itself (\xe2\x80\x9cthe intangible right of honest services\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence the <em>deus ex machina:</em> \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e pare that body of precedent down to its core,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 39.  Since the honest-services doctrine \xe2\x80\x9chad its genesis\xe2\x80\x9d in bribery prosecutions, and since several cases and counsel for Skilling referred to bribery and kickback schemes as \xe2\x80\x9ccore\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparadigm\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctypical\xe2\x80\x9d examples, or \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he most obvious form,\xe2\x80\x9d of honest-services fraud, <em>ante</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344 (internal quotation marks omitted),<em> </em>and since two cases and counsel for the Government say that they formed the \xe2\x80\x9cvast majority,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmost\xe2\x80\x9d or at least \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he bulk\xe2\x80\x9d of honest-services cases, <em>ante</em>, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344 (internal quotation marks omitted),<em> </em>THEREFORE it must be the case that they are <em>all</em>\nCongress meant by its reference to the honest-services doctrine.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if that conclusion followed from its premises, it would not suffice to eliminate the vagueness of the statute.  It would solve (perhaps) the indeterminacy of what acts constitute a breach of the \xe2\x80\x9chonest services\xe2\x80\x9d obligation under the pre-<em>McNally </em>law.  But it would not solve the most fundamental indeterminacy: the character of the \xe2\x80\x9cfiduciary capacity\xe2\x80\x9d to which the bribery and kickback restriction applies.  Does it apply only to public officials?  Or in addition to private individuals who contract with the public?  Or to everyone, including the corporate officer here?  The pre-<em>McNally</em> case law does not provide an answer.  Thus, even with the bribery and kickback limitation the statute does not answer the question \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the criterion of guilt?\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But that is perhaps beside the point, because it is obvious that mere prohibition of bribery and kickbacks was not the intent of the statute.  To say that bribery and kickbacks represented \xe2\x80\x9cthe core\xe2\x80\x9d of the doctrine, or that most cases applying the doctrine involved those offenses, is not to say that they <em>are </em>the doctrine.  All it proves is that the multifarious versions of the doctrine <em>overlap</em> with regard to those offenses.  But the doctrine itself is much more.  Among all the pre-<em>McNally</em> sm\xc3\xb6rg\xc3\xa5sbord-offerings of varieties of honest-services fraud, <em>not one</em> is limited to bribery and kickbacks.  That is a dish the Court has cooked up all on its own.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s claim to \xe2\x80\x9crespec[t] the legislature,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 45, n. 44 (emphasis deleted), is false.  It is entirely clear (as the Court and I agree) that Congress meant to reinstate the body of pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services law; and entirely clear that that prohibited much more (though precisely what more is uncertain) than bribery and kickbacks.  Perhaps it is true that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended \xc2\xa71346 to reach <em>at least</em> bribes and kickbacks,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 44.  That simply does not mean, as the Court now holds, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa71346 criminalizes <em>only</em>\xe2\x80\x9d bribery and kickbacks, <em>ante</em>, at 45.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Arriving at that conclusion requires not interpretation but invention.  The Court replaces a vague criminal standard that Congress adopted with a more narrow one (included within the vague one) that can pass constitutional muster.  I know of no precedent for such \xe2\x80\x9cparing down,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and it seems to me clearly beyond judicial power.  This is not, as the Court claims, <em>ante</em>, at 41, simply a matter of adopting a \xe2\x80\x9climiting construction\xe2\x80\x9d in the face of potential unconstitutionality.  To do that, our cases have been careful to note, the narrowing construction must be \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boos</em> v. <em>Barry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/312/index.html">485 U. S. 312</a>, 331 (1988), \xe2\x80\x9creasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Hooper</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/155/648/index.html">155 U. S. 648</a>, 657 (1895), or not \xe2\x80\x9cplainly contrary to the intent of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Edward J. DeBartolo Corp.</em> v. <em>Florida Gulf Coast Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/568/index.html">485 U. S. 568</a>, 575 (1988).  As we have seen (and the Court does not contest), <em>no court</em> before <em>McNally</em> concluded that the \xe2\x80\x9cdeprivation of honest services\xe2\x80\x9d meant <em>only</em> the acceptance of bribes or kickbacks.  If it were a \xe2\x80\x9cfairly possible\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d construction, not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to the intent of Congress,\xe2\x80\x9d one would think that <em>some</em> court would have adopted it.  The Court does not even point to a <em>post</em>-<em>McNally</em> case that reads \xc2\xa71346 to cover only bribery and kickbacks, and I am aware of none.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The canon of constitutional avoidance, on which the Court so heavily relies, see <em>ante</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342, states that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the constitutionality of a statute is assailed, if the statute be reasonably susceptible of two interpretations, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, it is our plain duty to adopt that construction which will save the statute from constitutional infirmity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States ex rel. Attorney General</em> v. <em>Delaware &amp; Hudson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/213/366/index.html">213 U.

Here there is no choice to be made between two \xe2\x80\x9cfair alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Until today, no one has thought (and there is no basis for thinking) that the honest-services statute prohibited only bribery and kickbacks.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I certainly agree with the Court that we must, \xe2\x80\x9cif we can,\xe2\x80\x9d uphold, rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccondemn,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enactments, <em>ante</em>, at 38.  But I do not believe we have the power, in order to uphold an enactment, to rewrite it.  Congress enacted the entirety of the pre-<em>McNally </em>honest-services law, the content of which is (to put it mildly) unclear.  In prior vagueness cases, we have resisted the temptation to make all things right with the stroke of our pen.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Goguen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/566/index.html">415 U. S. 566</a>, 575 (1974).  I would show the same restraint today, and reverse Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s conviction on the basis that \xc2\xa71346 provides no \xe2\x80\x9cascertainable standard\xe2\x80\x9d for the conduct it condemns, <em>L. Cohen</em>, 255 U. S., at 89.  Instead, the Court today adds to our functions the prescription of criminal law.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A brief word about the appropriate remedy.  As I noted <em>supra</em>, at 2, Skilling has argued that \xc2\xa71346 cannot be constitutionally applied to him because it affords no definition of the right whose deprivation it prohibits.  Though this reasoning is categorical, it does not make Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s challenge a \xe2\x80\x9cfacial\xe2\x80\x9d one, in the sense that it seeks invalidation of the statute in all its applications, as opposed to preventing its enforcement against him.  I continue to doubt whether \xe2\x80\x9cstriking down\xe2\x80\x9d a statute is ever an appropriate exercise of our Article III power.  See <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/41/index.html">527 U. S. 41</a>, 77 (1999) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  In the present case, the universality of the infirmity Skilling identifies in \xc2\xa71346 may mean that if he wins, anyone else prosecuted under the statute will win as well, see <em>Smith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 576\xe2\x80\x93578.  But Skilling only asks that <em>his</em> conviction be reversed, Brief for Petitioner 57\xe2\x80\x9358, so <em>the remedy</em> he seeks is not facial invalidation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would therefore reverse Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s conviction under \xc2\xa71346 on the ground that it fails to define the conduct it prohibits.  The fate of the statute in future prosecutions\xe2\x80\x94obvious from my reasoning in the case\xe2\x80\x94would be a matter for <em>stare decisis</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is hard to imagine a case that more clearly fits the description of what Chief Justice Waite said could not be done, in a colorful passage oft-cited in our vagueness opinions, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Reese</em>, 92 U. S., at 221:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe question, then, to be determined, is, whether we can introduce words of limitation into a penal statute so as to make it specific, when, as expressed, it is general only.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.  This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTo limit this statute in the manner now asked for would be to make a new law, not to enforce an old one.

This misses the point.  The Courts of Appeals may have consistently found unlawful the acceptance of a bribe or kickback by one or another sort of fiduciary, but they have not consistently described (as the statute does not) any test for who is a fiduciary.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Courts since \xc2\xa71346\xe2\x80\x99s enactment have fared no better, reproducing some of the same disputes that predated <em>McNally</em>.

We upheld the provision against a vagueness challenge\xe2\x80\x94not, however, by \xe2\x80\x9cparing down\xe2\x80\x9d the adjudications to a more narrow rule that we invented, but by concluding that what they held was not vague.  See <em>id.</em>, at 571\xe2\x80\x93574.  The string of cases the Court lists, see <em>ante</em>, at 41\xe2\x80\x9342, n. 41, (almost none of which addressed claims of vagueness), have nothing to do with \xe2\x80\x9cparing down.\xe2\x80\x9d  The one that comes closest, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Thirty-seven Photographs</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/363/index.html">402 U.

The Court relied on legislative history anticipating that the proceedings would be prompt, <em>id.</em>, at 370\xe2\x80\x93371, and noted that (unlike here) it was not \xe2\x80\x9cdecid[ing] issues of policy,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 372.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963357">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n561 U.

Of course, evidence of pretrial media attention and widespread community hostility may play a role in the bias inquiry.  Such evidence may be important in assessing the adequacy of <em>voir dire</em>, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/415/index.html">500 U. S. 415</a>, 428\xe2\x80\x93432 (1991), or in reviewing the denial of requests to dismiss particular jurors for cause, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Patton</em> v. <em>Yount</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/index.html">467 U. S. 1025</a>, 1036\xe2\x80\x931040 (1984).  There are occasions in which such evidence weighs heavily in favor of a change of venue.  In the end, however, if no biased jury is actually seated, there is no violation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to an impartial jury.  See <em>id</em>., at 1031\xe2\x80\x931035, 1041; <em>Murphy</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html">421 U.

Where there is extraordinary pretrial publicity and community hostility, he contends, a court must presume juror prejudice and thus grant a change of venue.  Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9334.  I disagree.  Careful <em>voir dire</em> can often ensure the selection of impartial jurors even where pretrial media coverage has generated much hostile community sentiment.  Moreover, once a jury has been selected, there are measures that a trial judge may take to insulate jurors from media coverage during the course of the trial.  What the Sixth Amendment requires is \xe2\x80\x9can impartial jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the jury that sits and returns a verdict is impartial, a defendant has received what the Sixth Amendment requires.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule that petitioner advances departs from the text of the Sixth Amendment and is difficult to apply.  It requires a trial judge to determine whether the adverse pretrial media coverage and community hostility in a particular case has reached a certain level of severity, but there is no clear way of demarcating that level or of determining whether it has been met.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner relies chiefly on three cases from the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94<em>Sheppard</em> v. <em>Maxwell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/333/index.html">384 U.

See <em>post</em>, at 34\xe2\x80\x9337.  But those highly fact-specific issues are not within the question presented.  Pet. for Cert. i.

Under our relevant precedents, the more intense the public\xe2\x80\x99s antipathy toward a defendant, the more careful a court must be to prevent that sentiment from tainting the jury.  In this case, passions ran extremely high.  The sudden collapse of Enron directly affected thousands of people in the Houston area and shocked the entire community.  The accompanying barrage of local media coverage was massive in volume and often caustic in tone.  As Enron\xe2\x80\x99s one-time CEO, Skilling was at the center of the storm.  Even if these extraordinary circumstances did not constitutionally compel a change of venue, they required the District Court to conduct a thorough <em>voir dire </em>in which prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 attitudes about the case were closely scrutinized.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry lacked the necessary thoroughness and left serious doubts about whether the jury empaneled to decide Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s case was capable of rendering an impartial decision based solely on the evidence presented in the courtroom.  Accordingly, I would grant Skilling relief on his fair-trial claim.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority understates the breadth and depth of community hostility toward Skilling and overlooks significant deficiencies in the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s jury selection process.  The failure of Enron wounded Houston deeply.  Virtually overnight, what had been the city\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clargest, most visible, and most prosperous company,\xe2\x80\x9d its \xe2\x80\x9cforemost social and charitable force,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca source of civic pride\xe2\x80\x9d was reduced to a \xe2\x80\x9cshattered shell.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb611, 13, pp. 649a\xe2\x80\x93650a, 1152a.  Thousands of the company\xe2\x80\x99s employees lost their jobs and saw their retirement savings vanish.  As the effects rippled through the local economy, thousands of additional jobs disappeared, businesses shuttered, and community groups that once benefited from Enron\xe2\x80\x99s largesse felt the loss of millions of dollars in contributions.

Enron\xe2\x80\x99s community ties were so extensive that the entire local U. S.

Scoffing at Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to paint himself as \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98victim\xe2\x80\x99 of his subordinates,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 1394a, the Chronicle<em> </em>derided \xe2\x80\x9cthe doofus defense\xe2\x80\x9d that Lay and Skilling were expected to offer, <em>id</em>., at 1401a.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The Chronicle<em> </em>referred to the coming Skilling/Lay trial as \xe2\x80\x9cthe main event\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cThe Big One,\xe2\x80\x9d which would finally bring \xe2\x80\x9cthe true measure of justice in the Enron saga.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 40002; App. 1457a, 1460a.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On the day the superseding indictment charging Lay was issued, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Chronicle dedicated three-quarters of its front page, 2 other full pages, and substantial portions of 4 other pages, all in the front or business sections, to th[e] story.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., \xc2\xb657, at<em> </em>580a\xe2\x80\x93581a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Citing the widely felt sense of victimhood among Houstonians and the voluminous adverse publicity, Skilling moved in November 2004 for a change of venue.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court denied the motion, characterizing the media coverage as largely \xe2\x80\x9cobjective and unemotional.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief for United States 11a.  <em>Voir dire</em>, it concluded, would provide an effective means to \xe2\x80\x9cferret out any bias\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury pool.  <em>Id.</em>, at 18a; see <em>ante</em>, at 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To that end, the District Court began the jury selection process by mailing screening questionnaires to 400 prospective jurors in November 2005.  The completed questionnaires of the 283 respondents not excused for hardship dramatically illustrated the widespread impact of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse on the Houston community and confirmed the intense animosity of Houstonians toward Skilling and his codefendants.  More than one-third of the prospective jurors (approximately 99 of 283, by my count) indicated that they or persons they knew had lost money or jobs as a result of the Enron bankruptcy.  Two-thirds of the jurors (about 188 of 283) expressed views about Enron or the defendants that suggested a potential predisposition to convict.  In many instances, they did not mince words, describing Skilling as \xe2\x80\x9csmug,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9carrogant,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbrash,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconceited,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cgreedy,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctotally unethical and criminal,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ca crook,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe biggest liar on the face of the earth,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cguilty as sin\xe2\x80\x9d (capitalization omitted).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Only about 5 percent of the prospective jurors (15 of 283) did not read the Houston Chronicle, had not otherwise \xe2\x80\x9cheard or read about any of the Enron cases,\xe2\x80\x9d Record 13019, were not connected to Enron victims, and gave no answers suggesting possible antipathy toward the defendants.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of 119 members of the jury pool for cause, hardship, or disability, but numerous individuals who had made harsh comments about Skilling remained.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On December 28, 2005, shortly after the questionnaires had been returned, Causey pleaded guilty.  The plea was covered in lead newspaper and television stories.  A front-page headline in the Chronicle<em> </em>proclaimed that \xe2\x80\x9cCausey\xe2\x80\x99s plea wreaks havoc for Lay, Skilling.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 12049, n. 13; see also <em>ibid</em>. (quoting a former U. S. attorney who described the plea as \xe2\x80\x9ca serious blow to the defense\xe2\x80\x9d).  A Chronicle<em> </em>editorial opined that \xe2\x80\x9cCausey\xe2\x80\x99s admission of securities fraud \xe2\x80\xa6 . makes less plausible Lay\xe2\x80\x99s claim that most of the guilty pleas were the result of prosecutorial pressure rather than actual wrongdoing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 12391.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the trial date quickly approaching, Skilling renewed his change-of-venue motion, arguing that both the questionnaire responses and the Causey guilty plea confirmed that he could not receive a fair trial in Houston.  In the alternative, Skilling asserted that \xe2\x80\x9cdefendants are entitled to a more thorough jury selection process than currently envisioned by the [c]ourt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 12067.  The court had announced its intention to question individual jurors at the bench with one attorney for each side present, and to complete the <em>voir dire </em>in a single day.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 11804\xe2\x80\x9311805, 11808.  Skilling proposed, <em>inter alia</em>, that defense counsel be afforded a greater role in questioning, <em>id</em>., at 12074; that jurors be questioned privately <em>in</em> <em>camera </em>or in a closed courtroom where it would be easier for counsel to consult with their colleagues, clients, and jury consultants, <em>id</em>., at 12070\xe2\x80\x9312072; and that the court \xe2\x80\x9cavoid leading questions,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9ctend to [e]licit affirmative responses from prospective jurors that may not reflect their actual views,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id</em>., at 12072.  At a minimum, Skilling asserted, the court should grant a continuance of at least 30 days and send a revised questionnaire to a new group of prospective jurors.  <em>Id</em>., at 12074\xe2\x80\x9312075.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court denied Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s motion without a hearing, stating in a brief order that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot persuaded that the evidence or arguments urged by defendants \xe2\x80\xa6 establish that pretrial publicity and/or community prejudice raise a presumption of inherent jury prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 14115.  According to the court, the \xe2\x80\x9cjury questionnaires sent to the remaining members of the jury panel and the court\xe2\x80\x99s voir dire examination of the jury panel provide adequate safeguards to defendants and will result in the selection of a fair and impartial jury in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 14115\xe2\x80\x9314116.  The court did agree to delay the trial by two weeks, until January 30, 2006.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The coming trial featured prominently in local news outlets.  A front-page, eve-of-trial story in the Chronicle<em> </em>described \xe2\x80\x9cthe hurt and anger and resentment\xe2\x80\x9d that had been \xe2\x80\x9cchurn[ing] inside\xe2\x80\x9d Houstonians since Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  <em>Id.</em>, at 39946.  Again criticizing Lay and Skilling for offering a \xe2\x80\x9cdoofus defense\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9ca plea of not guilty by reason of empty-headedness\xe2\x80\x9d), the paper stated that \xe2\x80\x9cLay and Skilling took hundreds of millions in compensation yet now fail to accept the responsibility that went with it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The article allowed that the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 guilt, \xe2\x80\x9cthough perhaps widely assumed, remains even now an assertion.  A jury now takes up the task of deciding whether that assertion is valid.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 39947.  The next paragraph, however, assured readers that \xe2\x80\x9cit\xe2\x80\x99s normal for your skin to crawl when Lay or Skilling claim with doe-eyed innocence that they were unaware that something was amiss at Enron.  The company\xe2\x80\x99s utter failure belies the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (one paragraph break omitted); see also <em>id</em>., at 39904 (declaring that Lay and Skilling would \xe2\x80\x9chave to offer a convincing explanation for how executives once touted as corporate geniuses could be so much in the dark about the illegal activities and deceptive finances of their own company\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is against this backdrop of widespread community impact and pervasive pretrial publicity that jury selection in Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s case unfolded.  Approximately 160 prospective jurors appeared for <em>voir dire </em>at a federal courthouse located \xe2\x80\x9cabout six blocks from Enron\xe2\x80\x99s former headquarters.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 561.  Addressing them as a group, the District Court began by briefly describing the case and providing a standard admonition about the need to be fair and impartial and to decide the case based solely on the trial evidence and jury instructions.  The court then asked whether anyone had \xe2\x80\x9cany reservations about your ability to conscientiously and fairly follow these very important rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 815a.  Two individuals raised their hands and were called forward to the bench.  One told the court that he thought Lay and Skilling \xe2\x80\x9cknew exactly what they were doing\xe2\x80\x9d and would have to prove their innocence.  <em>Id</em>., at 818a\xe2\x80\x93819a.  The second juror, who had stated on his written questionnaire that he held no opinion that would preclude him from being impartial, declared that he \xe2\x80\x9cwould dearly love to sit on this jury.  I would love to claim responsibility, at least 1/12 of the responsibility, for putting these sons of bitches away for the rest of their lives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 819a\xe2\x80\x93820a.  The court excused both jurors for cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court proceeded to question individual jurors from the bench.  As the majority recounts, <em>ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, the court asked them a few general yes/no questions about their exposure to Enron-related news, often variations of, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you recall any particular articles that stand out that you\xe2\x80\x99ve read about the case?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 850a.  The court also asked about questionnaire answers that suggested bias, focusing mainly on whether, notwithstanding seemingly partial comments, the prospective jurors believed they \xe2\x80\x9ccould be fair\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cput the government to its proof.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 852a.  Counsel were permitted to follow up on issues raised by the court.  The court made clear, however, that its patience would be limited, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 879a, and questioning tended to be brief\xe2\x80\x94generally less than five minutes per person.  Even so, it exposed disqualifying biases among several prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their ability to be fair.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once it identified 38 qualified prospective jurors, the court allowed the defense and Government to exercise their allotted peremptory challenges.  This left 12 jurors and 4 alternates, who were sworn in and instructed, for the first time, \xe2\x80\x9cnot [to] read anything dealing with the case or listen to any discussion of the case on radio or television or access any Internet sites that may deal with the case\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cinform your friends and family members that they should not discuss with you anything they may have read or heard about this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1026a.  Start to finish, the selection process took about five hours.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial commenced the next day and lasted four months.  After several days of deliberations, the jury found Skilling guilty of conspiracy, 12 counts of securities fraud, 5 counts of making false representations to auditors, and 1 count of insider trading; it acquitted on 9 insider trading counts.  The jury found Lay guilty on all counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Skilling asserted that he had been denied his constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.  Addressing this claim, the Court of Appeals began by disavowing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings concerning \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity hostility.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was, the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9csufficient inflammatory pretrial material to require a finding of presumed prejudice, especially in light of the immense volume of coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 559.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rejudice was [also] inherent in an alleged co-conspirator\xe2\x80\x99s well-publicized decision to plead guilty on the eve of trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court of Appeals, moreover, faulted the District Court for failing to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the wider context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 560.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t was not enough for the court merely to assess the tone of the news reporting.  The evaluation of the volume and nature of reporting is merely a proxy for the real inquiry: whether there could be a fair trial by an impartial jury that was not influenced by outside, irrelevant sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (internal quotation marks omitted).  According to the Court of Appeals, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district court seemed to overlook that the prejudice came from more than just pretrial media publicity, but also from the sheer number of victims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having determined that \xe2\x80\x9cSkilling was entitled to a presumption of prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals proceeded to explain that \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption is rebuttable, \xe2\x80\xa6 and the government may demonstrate from the <em>voir dire</em> that an impartial jury was actually impanelled.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 561 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Describing the <em>voir dire </em>as \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csearching,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproper and thorough,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 562, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he government [had] met its burden of showing that the actual jury that convicted Skilling was impartial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 564\xe2\x80\x93565.  On this basis, the Court of Appeals rejected Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s claim and affirmed his convictions.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury and the due process right to a fundamentally fair trial guarantee to criminal defendants a trial in which jurors set aside preconceptions, disregard extrajudicial influences, and decide guilt or innocence \xe2\x80\x9cbased on the evidence presented in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Irvin</em> v. <em>Dowd</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/366/717/index.html"></a><a href="/us/366/717/index.html">366 U.

Community passions, often inflamed by adverse pretrial publicity, can call the integrity of a trial into doubt.  In some instances, this Court has observed, the hostility of the community becomes so severe as to give rise to a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption of [juror] prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patton</em> v. <em>Yount</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html">467 U. S. 1025</a>, 1031 (1984).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals incorporated the concept of presumptive prejudice into a burden-shifting framework: Once the defendant musters sufficient evidence of community hostility, the onus shifts to the Government to prove the impartiality of the jury.  The majority similarly envisions a fixed point at which public passions become so intense that prejudice to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial rights must be presumed.  The majority declines, however, to decide whether the presumption is rebuttable, as the Court of Appeals held.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has never treated the notion of presumptive prejudice so formalistically.  Our decisions instead merely convey the commonsense understanding that as the tide of public enmity rises, so too does the danger that the prejudices of the community will infiltrate the jury.  The underlying question has always been this: Do we have confidence that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict was \xe2\x80\x9cinduced only by evidence and argument in open court, and not by any outside influence, whether of private talk or public print\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Colorado ex rel. Attorney General of Colo.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/205/454/index.html">205 U. S. 454</a>, 462 (1907).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The inquiry is necessarily case specific.  In selecting a jury, a trial court must take measures adapted to the intensity, pervasiveness, and character of the pretrial publicity and community animus.  Reviewing courts, meanwhile, must assess whether the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s procedures sufficed under the circumstances to keep the jury free from disqualifying bias.  Cf. <em>Murphy</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html">421 U.

In <em>Rideau</em>, repeated television broadcasts of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s confession to murder, robbery, and kidnaping so thoroughly poisoned local sentiment as to raise doubts that even the most careful <em>voir dire</em> could have secured an impartial jury.  A change of venue, the Court determined, was thus the only way to assure a fair trial.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa723.2(a), p. 264 (3d ed. 2007) (hereinafter LaFave) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe best reading of <em>Rideau </em>is that the Court there recognized that prejudicial publicity may be so inflammatory and so pervasive that the voir dire simply cannot be trusted to fully reveal the likely prejudice among prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the majority describes, <em>ante</em>, at 14, this Court reached similar conclusions in <em>Estes</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/532/index.html">381 U.

These cases involved not only massive pretrial publicity but also media disruption of the trial process itself.  Rejecting the argument that the defendants were not entitled to relief from their convictions because they \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] established no isolatable prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court described the \xe2\x80\x9cuntoward circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cinherently suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Estes</em>, 381 U.

Criticizing the trial courts\xe2\x80\x99 failures \xe2\x80\x9cto protect the jury from outside influence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 358, the Court stressed that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere there is a reasonable likelihood that prejudicial news prior to trial will prevent a fair trial, the judge should continue the case until the threat abates, or transfer it to another [venue] not so permeated with publicity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 363.  <em>Estes</em> and <em>Sheppard</em> thus applied <em>Rideau</em>\xe2\x80\x99s insight that in particularly extreme circumstances even the most rigorous <em>voir dire</em> cannot suffice to dispel the reasonable likelihood of jury bias.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from these exceptional cases, this Court has declined to discount <em>voir dire </em>entirely and has instead examined the particulars of the jury selection process to determine whether it sufficed to produce a jury untainted by pretrial publicity and community animus.  The Court has recognized that when antipathy toward a defendant pervades the community there is a high risk that biased jurors will find their way onto the panel.  The danger is not merely that some prospective jurors will deliberately hide their prejudices, but also that, as \xe2\x80\x9cpart of a community deeply hostile to the accused,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthey may unwittingly [be] influenced\xe2\x80\x9d by the fervor that surrounds them.  <em>Murphy</em>, 421 U. S., at 803.  To assure an impartial jury in such adverse circumstances, a trial court must carefully consider the knowledge and attitudes of prospective jurors and then closely scrutinize the reliability of their assurances of fairness.

Of the 12 jurors seated, 8 \xe2\x80\x9cthought petitioner was guilty,\xe2\x80\x9d although \xe2\x80\x9ceach indicated that notwithstanding his opinion he could render an impartial verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 727, 724.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the seated jurors\xe2\x80\x99 assurances of impartiality, this Court invalidated Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for want of due process.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is not required,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court declared, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the jurors be totally ignorant of the facts and issues involved. \xe2\x80\xa6 It is sufficient if the juror can lay aside his impression or opinion and render a verdict based on the evidence presented in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 722\xe2\x80\x93723.  The Court emphasized, however, that a juror\xe2\x80\x99s word on this matter is not decisive, particularly when \xe2\x80\x9cthe build-up of prejudice [in the community] is clear and convincing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 725.  Many of Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s jurors, the Court noted, had been influenced by \xe2\x80\x9cthe pattern of deep and bitter prejudice shown to be present throughout the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 727 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Court did not \xe2\x80\x9cdoubt [that] each juror was sincere when he said that he would be fair and impartial to [Irvin], but \xe2\x80\xa6 [w]here so many, so many times, admitted prejudice, such a statement of impartiality can be given little weight.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 728.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The media coverage and community animosity in <em>Irvin</em> was particularly intense.  In three subsequent cases, this Court recognized that high-profile cases may generate substantial publicity without stirring similar public passions.  The jury selection process in such cases, the Court clarified, generally need not be as exhaustive as in a case such as <em>Irvin</em>. <em> </em>So long as the trial court conducts a reasonable inquiry into extrajudicial influences and the ability of prospective jurors to presume innocence and render a verdict based solely on the trial evidence, we would generally have no reason to doubt the jury\xe2\x80\x99s impartiality.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first of these cases, <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html">421 U. S. 794</a>, involved a well-known defendant put on trial for a widely publicized Miami Beach robbery.  The state trial court denied his motion for a change of venue and during <em>voir dire</em> excused 20 of the 78 prospective jurors for cause.  Distinguishing <em>Irvin</em>, this Court saw no indication in the <em>voir dire </em>of \xe2\x80\x9csuch hostility to [Murphy] by the jurors who served in his trial as to suggest a partiality that could not be laid aside.\xe2\x80\x9d  421 U.

Although some jurors \xe2\x80\x9chad a vague recollection of the robbery with which [Murphy] was charged and each had some knowledge of [his] past crimes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cnone betrayed any belief in the relevance of [Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s] past to the present case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa04 (contrasting a juror\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmere familiarity with [a defendant] or his past\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9can actual predisposition against him\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]hese indicia of impartiality,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court suggested, \xe2\x80\x9cmight be disregarded in a case where the general atmosphere in the community or courtroom is sufficiently inflammatory, but the circumstances surrounding [Murphy\xe2\x80\x99s] trial [were] not at all of that variety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 802.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a second case, <em>Yount</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html">467 U.

He requested a change of venue, citing pretrial publicity and the widespread local knowledge that he had previously been convicted and had made confessions that would be inadmissible in court.  The state trial court denied Yount\xe2\x80\x99s motion and seated a jury following a 10-day <em>voir dire </em>of 292 prospective jurors.  Nearly all of the prospective jurors had heard of the case, and 77 percent \xe2\x80\x9cadmitted they would carry an opinion into the jury box.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1029.  Declining to grant relief on federal habeas review, this Court stressed the significant interval between Yount\xe2\x80\x99s first trial\xe2\x80\x94when \xe2\x80\x9cadverse publicity and the community\xe2\x80\x99s sense of outrage were at their height\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and his second trial, which \xe2\x80\x9cdid not occur until four years later, at a time when prejudicial publicity was greatly diminished and community sentiment had softened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1032.  While 8 of the 14 seated jurors and alternates had \xe2\x80\x9cat some time \xe2\x80\xa6 formed an opinion as to Yount\xe2\x80\x99s guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly extensive\xe2\x80\x9d <em>voir dire </em>confirmed that \xe2\x80\x9ctime had weakened or eliminated any\xe2\x80\x9d bias they once may have harbored.  <em>Id</em>., at 1029\xe2\x80\x931030, 1034, n.\xc2\xa010, 1033.  Accordingly, this Court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe trial court did not commit manifest error in finding that the jury as a whole was impartial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1032.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court most recently wrestled with the issue of pretrial publicity in <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em> v. <em>Virginia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/415/index.html"></a><a href="/us/500/415/index.html">500 U. S. 415</a> (1991).  Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min stood accused of murdering a woman while out of prison on a work detail.  Citing 47 newspaper articles about the crime, Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min moved for a change of venue.  The state trial court deferred its ruling and attempted to seat a jury.  During group questioning, 16 of the 26 prospective jurors indicated that they had heard about the case from media or other sources.  Dividing these prospective jurors into panels of four, the court asked further general questions about their ability to be fair given what they had heard or read.  One juror answered equivocally and was dismissed for cause.  The court refused Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min\xe2\x80\x99s request to ask more specific questions \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the content of news items that potential jurors might have read or seen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 419.  Of the 12 persons who served on the jury, \xe2\x80\x9c8 had at one time or another read or heard something about the case.  None had indicated that he had formed an opinion about the case or would be biased in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 421.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rejecting Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to analogize his case to <em>Irvin</em>, this Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9cthe cases differ both in the kind of community in which the coverage took place and in extent of media coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at 429.  Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min\xe2\x80\x99s offense occurred in the metropolitan Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., area, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich has a population of over 3 million, and in which, unfortunately, hundreds of murders are committed each year.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  While the crime garnered \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d pretrial publicity, the coverage was not as pervasive as in <em>Irvin</em> and \xe2\x80\x9cdid not contain the same sort of damaging information.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at 429\xe2\x80\x93430.  Moreover, in contrast to <em>Irvin</em>, the seated jurors uniformly disclaimed having ever formed an opinion about the case.  Given these circumstances, this Court rebuffed Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the trial court committed constitutional error by declining to \xe2\x80\x9cmake precise inquiries about the contents of any news reports that potential jurors have read.\xe2\x80\x9d  500 U. S., at 424.  The Court stressed, however, that its ruling was context-specific: \xe2\x80\x9cHad the trial court in this case been confronted with the \xe2\x80\x98wave of public passion\xe2\x80\x99 engendered by pretrial publicity that occurred in connection with Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment might well have required more extensive examination of potential jurors than it undertook here.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 429.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is necessary to determine how this case compares to our existing fair-trial precedents.  Were the circumstances so inherently prejudicial that, as in <em>Rideau</em>, even the most scrupulous <em>voir dire</em> would have been \xe2\x80\x9cbut a hollow formality\xe2\x80\x9d incapable of reliably producing an impartial jury?  373 U. S., at 726.  If the circumstances were not of this character, did the District Court conduct a jury selection process sufficiently adapted to the level of pretrial publicity and community animus to ensure the seating of jurors capable of presuming innocence and shutting out extrajudicial influences?</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Though the question is close, I agree with the Court that the prospect of seating an unbiased jury in Houston was not so remote as to compel the conclusion that the District Court acted unconstitutionally in denying Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s motion to change venue.  Three considerations lead me to this conclusion.  First, as the Court observes, <em>ante</em>, at 16, the size and diversity of the Houston community make it probable that the jury pool contained a nontrivial number of persons who were unaffected by Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse, neutral in their outlook, and unlikely to be swept up in the public furor.  Second, media coverage of the case, while ubiquitous and often inflammatory, did not, as the Court points out, <em>ante</em>, at 17, contain a confession by Skilling or similar \xe2\x80\x9csmoking-gun\xe2\x80\x9d evidence of specific criminal acts.  For many prospective jurors, the guilty plea of codefendant and alleged co-conspirator Causey, along with the pleas and convictions of other Enron executives, no doubt suggested guilt by association.  But reasonable minds exposed to such information would not necessarily have formed an indelible impression that Skilling himself was guilty as charged.  Cf. <em>Rideau</em>, 373 U. S., at 726 (a majority of the county\xe2\x80\x99s residents were \xe2\x80\x9cexposed repeatedly and in depth to the spectacle of Rideau personally confessing in detail to the crimes with which he was later to be charged\xe2\x80\x9d).  Third, there is no suggestion that the courtroom in this case became, as in <em>Estes </em>and <em>Sheppard</em>, a \xe2\x80\x9ccarnival\xe2\x80\x9d in which the \xe2\x80\x9ccalmness and solemnity\xe2\x80\x9d of the proceedings was compromised.  <em>Sheppard</em>, 384 U. S., at 358, 350 (internal quotation marks omitted).  It is thus appropriate to examine the <em>voir dire </em>and determine whether it instills confidence in the impartiality of the jury actually selected.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that the <em>voir dire </em>\xe2\x80\x9cadequately detect[ed] and defuse[d] juror bias,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 20, the Court downplays the extent of the community\xe2\x80\x99s antipathy toward Skilling and exaggerates the rigor of the jury selection process.  The devastating impact of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse and the relentless media coverage demanded exceptional care on the part of the District Court to ensure the seating of an impartial jury.  While the procedures employed by the District Court might have been adequate in the typical high-profile case, they did not suffice in the extraordinary circumstances of this case to safeguard Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to a fair trial before an impartial jury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In conducting this analysis, I am mindful of the \xe2\x80\x9cwide discretion\xe2\x80\x9d owed to trial courts when it comes to jury-related issues.  <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em>, 500 U. S., at 427; cf. <em>ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  Trial courts are uniquely positioned to assess public sentiment and the credibility of prospective jurors.  Proximity to events, however, is not always a virtue.  Persons in the midst of a tumult often lack a panoramic view.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ppellate tribunals [thus] have the duty to make an independent evaluation of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sheppard</em>, 384 U. S., at 362.  In particular, reviewing courts are well qualified to inquire into whether a trial court implemented procedures adequate to keep community prejudices from infecting the jury.  If the jury selection process does not befit the circumstances of the case, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings on impartiality are necessarily called into doubt.  See <em>Morgan</em>,<em> </em>504 U. S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93730 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Without an adequate <em>voir dire</em> the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to remove prospective jurors who will not be able impartially to follow the court\xe2\x80\x99s instructions and evaluate the evidence cannot be fulfilled\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Rosales-Lopez</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/451/182/index.html">451 U.

For Houstonians, Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse was an event of once-in-a-generation proportions.  Not only was the volume of media coverage \xe2\x80\x9cimmense\xe2\x80\x9d and frequently intemperate, but \xe2\x80\x9cthe sheer number of victims\xe2\x80\x9d created a climate in which animosity toward Skilling ran deep and the desire for conviction was widely shared.  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 559\xe2\x80\x93560.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The level of public animus toward Skilling dwarfed that present in cases such as <em>Murphy </em>and <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99Min</em>.  The pretrial publicity in those cases consisted of dozens of news reports, most of which were \xe2\x80\x9clargely factual in nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murphy</em>, 421 U. S., at 802.  There was no indication that the relevant communities had been captivated by the cases or had adopted fixed views about the defendants.  In contrast, the number of media reports in this case reached the tens of thousands, and full-throated denunciations of Skilling were common.  The much closer analogy is thus to <em>Irvin</em>, which similarly featured a \xe2\x80\x9cbarrage\xe2\x80\x9d of media coverage and a \xe2\x80\x9chuge \xe2\x80\xa6 wave of public passion,\xe2\x80\x9d 366 U. S., at 725, 728, although even that case did not, as here, involve direct harm to entire segments of the community.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Attempting to distinguish <em>Irvin</em>, the majority suggests that Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s economic offenses were less incendiary than Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s violent crime spree and that \xe2\x80\x9cnews stories about Enron contained nothing resembling the horrifying information rife in reports about Irvin\xe2\x80\x99s rampage of robberies and murders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  Along similar lines, the District Court described \xe2\x80\x9cthe facts of this case [as] neither heinous nor sensational.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Brief for United States 10a.  The majority also points to the four years that passed between Enron\xe2\x80\x99s declaration of bankruptcy and the start of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial, asserting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe decibel level of media attention diminished somewhat\xe2\x80\x9d over this time.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  Neither of these arguments is persuasive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, while violent crimes may well provoke widespread community outrage more readily than crimes involving monetary loss, economic crimes are certainly capable of rousing public passions, particularly when thousands of unsuspecting people are robbed of their livelihoods and retirement savings.  Indeed, the record in this case is replete with examples of visceral outrage toward Skilling and other Enron executives.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Record 39946 (front-page, eve-of-trial story describing \xe2\x80\x9cthe hurt and anger and resentment \xe2\x80\xa6 churn[ing] inside\xe2\x80\x9d the people of Houston).  Houstonians compared Skilling to, among other things, a rapist, an axe murderer, and an Al Qaeda terrorist.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  As one commentator observed, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t\xe2\x80\x99s a sign of how shocked Houstonians are about Enron\xe2\x80\x99s ignominious demise that Sept. 11 can be invoked\xe2\x80\x94and is frequently\xe2\x80\x94to explain the shock of the company\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Supp. Record 544.  The bad blood was so strong that Skilling and other top executives hired private security to protect themselves from persons inclined to take the law into their own hands.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 1154a (\xe2\x80\x9cAfter taking the temperature of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s victims, [a local lawyer] says the Enron executives are wise to take security precautions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the passage of time did little to soften community sentiment.  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>ante</em>, at 17, this case in no way resembles <em>Yount</em>, where, by the time of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retrial, \xe2\x80\x9cprejudicial publicity [had] greatly diminished\xe2\x80\x9d and community animus had significantly waned.  467 U. S., at 1032; see also <em>ibid</em>. (in the months preceding the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s retrial, newspaper reports about the case averaged \xe2\x80\x9cless than one article per month,\xe2\x80\x9d and public interest was \xe2\x80\x9cminimal\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Enron story was a continuing saga, and \xe2\x80\x9cpublicity remained intense throughout.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 560.  Not only did Enron\xe2\x80\x99s downfall generate wall-to-wall news coverage, but so too did a succession of subsequent Enron-related events.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Of particular note is the highly publicized guilty plea of codefendant Causey just weeks before Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  If anything, the time that elapsed between the bankruptcy and the trial made the task of seating an unbiased jury more difficult, not less.  For many members of the jury pool, each highly publicized Enron-related guilty plea or conviction likely served to increase their certainty that Skilling too had engaged in\xe2\x80\x94if not masterminded\xe2\x80\x94criminal acts, particularly given that the media coverage reinforced this view.  See <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  The trial of Skilling and Lay was the culmination of all that had come before.  See Record 40002 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutors followed the classic pattern of working their way up through the ranks\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Chronicle<em> </em>put it in July 2005, shortly after the trial of several Enron Broadband Services executives ended without convictions, \xe2\x80\x9cThe real trial, the true measure of justice in the Enron saga, begins in January.  Let the small fry swim free if need be.  We\xe2\x80\x99ve got bigger fish in need of frying.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1460a (paragraph breaks omitted); see also <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the beginning, the Enron prosecution has had one true measure of success: Lay and Skilling in a cold steel cage\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any doubt that the prevailing mindset in the Houston community remained overwhelmingly negative was dispelled by prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 responses to the written questionnaires.  As previously indicated, <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937, more than one-third of the prospective jurors either knew victims of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse or were victims themselves, and two-thirds gave responses suggesting an antidefendant bias.  In many instances their contempt for Skilling was palpable.  See nn.\xc2\xa04, 6, <em>supra</em>.  Only a small fraction of the prospective jurors raised no red flags in their responses.  And this was <em>before </em>Causey\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea and the flurry of news reports that accompanied the approach of trial.  One of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s experts, a political scientist who had studied pretrial publicity \xe2\x80\x9cfor over 35 years\xe2\x80\x9d and consulted in more than 200 high-profile cases (in which he had recommended against venue changes more often than not), \xe2\x80\x9cc[a]me to the conclusion that the extent and depth of bias shown in these questionnaires is the highest or at least one of the very highest I have ever encountered.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb62, 7, pp. 783a, 785a (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the extent of the antipathy evident both in the community at large and in the responses to the written questionnaire, it was critical for the District Court to take \xe2\x80\x9cstrong measures\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure the selection of \xe2\x80\x9can impartial jury free from outside influences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sheppard</em>, 384 U.

As this Court has recognized, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a community where most veniremen will admit to a disqualifying prejudice, the reliability of the others\xe2\x80\x99 protestations may be drawn into question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murphy</em>, 421 U.

Perhaps because it had underestimated the public\xe2\x80\x99s antipathy toward Skilling, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s 5-hour <em>voir dire</em> was manifestly insufficient to identify and remove biased jurors.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, important lines of inquiry were not pursued at all.

Implying that the District Court undertook this inquiry, the majority states that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly two venire members recalled [Causey\xe2\x80\x99s] plea.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In fact, the court asked very few prospective jurors any questions directed to their knowledge of or feelings about that event.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Considering how much news the plea generated, many more than two venire members were likely aware of it.  The lack of questioning, however, makes the prejudicial impact of the plea on those jurors impossible to assess.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court also rarely asked prospective jurors to describe personal interactions they may have had about the case, or to consider whether they might have difficulty avoiding discussion of the case with family, friends, or colleagues during the course of the lengthy trial.  The tidbits of information that trickled out on these subjects provided cause for concern.  In response to general media-related questions, several prospective jurors volunteered that they had spoken with others about the case.  Juror 74, for example, indicated that her husband was the \xe2\x80\x9cnews person,\xe2\x80\x9d that they had \xe2\x80\x9ctalked about it,\xe2\x80\x9d that she had also heard things \xe2\x80\x9cfrom work,\xe2\x80\x9d and that what she heard was \xe2\x80\x9call negative, of course.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 948a.  The court, however, did not seek elaboration about the substance of these interactions.  Surely many prospective jurors had similar conversations, particularly once they learned upon receiving the written questionnaire that they might end up on Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 personal interactions, moreover, may well have left them with the sense that the community was counting on a conviction.  Yet this too was a subject the District Court did not adequately explore.  On the few occasions when prospective jurors were asked whether they would feel pressure from the public to convict, they acknowledged that it might be difficult to return home after delivering a not-guilty verdict.  Juror 75, for instance, told the court, \xe2\x80\x9cI think a lot of people feel that they\xe2\x80\x99re guilty.  And maybe they\xe2\x80\x99re expecting something to come out of this trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 956a.  It would be \xe2\x80\x9ctough,\xe2\x80\x9d she recognized, \xe2\x80\x9cto vote not guilty and go back into the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 957a; see also <em>id</em>., at 852a (Juror 10) (admitting \xe2\x80\x9csome hesitancy\xe2\x80\x9d about \xe2\x80\x9ctelling people the government didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove its case\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to potential nonmedia sources of bias, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exchange with Juror 101 is particularly troubling.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Although Juror 101 responded in the negative when asked whether she had \xe2\x80\x9cread anything in the newspaper that [stood] out in [her] mind,\xe2\x80\x9d she volunteered that she \xe2\x80\x9cjust heard that, between the two of them, [Skilling and Lay] had $43 million to contribute for their case and that there was an insurance policy that they could collect on, also.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 998a.  This information, she explained, \xe2\x80\x9cwas just something I overheard today\xe2\x80\x94other jurors talking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  It seemed suspicious, she intimated, \xe2\x80\x9cto have an insurance policy ahead of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 999a.  The court advised her that \xe2\x80\x9cmost corporations provide insurance for their officers and directors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court, however, did not investigate the matter further, even though it had earlier instructed prospective jurors not to talk to each other about the case.  <em>Id</em>., at 843a.  It is thus not apparent whether other prospective jurors also overheard the information and whether they too believed that it reflected unfavorably on the defendants; nor is it apparent what other outside information may have been shared among the venire members.  At the very least, Juror 101\xe2\x80\x99s statements indicate that the court\xe2\x80\x99s questions were failing to bring to light the extent of jurors\xe2\x80\x99 exposure to potentially prejudicial facts and that some prospec-\ntive jurors were having difficulty following the court\xe2\x80\x99s directives.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The topics that the District Court did cover were addressed in cursory fashion.  Most prospective jurors were asked just a few yes/no questions about their general exposure to media coverage and a handful of additional questions concerning any responses to the written questionnaire that suggested bias.  In many instances, their answers were unenlightening.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Yet the court rarely sought to draw them out with open-ended questions about their impressions of Enron or Skilling and showed limited patience for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s followup efforts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id</em>., at 879a, 966a.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  When prospective jurors were more forthcoming, their responses tended to highlight the ubiquity and negative tone of the local news coverage, thus underscoring the need to press the more guarded members of the venire for further information.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Juror 17, for example, mentioned hearing a radio program that very morning in which a former Enron employee compared persons who did not think Skilling was guilty to Holocaust deniers.  See <em>id</em>., at 863a (\xe2\x80\x9c[H]e said he thought that he would find them guilty automatically if he was on the jury because he said that it would be worse than a German trying to say that they didn\xe2\x80\x99t kill the Jews\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Other jurors may well have encountered, and been influenced by, similarly incendiary rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These deficiencies in the form and content of the <em>voir dire </em>questions contributed to a deeper problem: The District Court failed to make a sufficiently critical assessment of prospective jurors\xe2\x80\x99 assurances of impartiality.  Although the Court insists otherwise, <em>ante</em>, at 26, the <em>voir dire </em>transcript indicates that the District Court essentially took jurors at their word when they promised to be fair.  Indeed, the court declined to dismiss for cause any prospective juror who ultimately gave a clear assurance of impartiality, no matter how much equivocation preceded it.  Juror 29, for instance, wrote on her questionnaire that Skilling was \xe2\x80\x9cnot an honest man.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 881a.  During questioning, she acknowledged having previously thought the defendants were guilty, and she disclosed that she lost $50,000\xe2\x80\x93$60,000 in her 401(k) as a result of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse.  <em>Id</em>., at 880a, 883a.  But she ultimately agreed that she would be able to presume innocence.  <em>Id</em>., at 881a, 884a.  Noting that she \xe2\x80\x9cblame[d] Enron for the loss of her money\xe2\x80\x9d and appeared to have \xe2\x80\x9cunshakeable bias,\xe2\x80\x9d Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s counsel challenged her for cause.  <em>Id</em>., at 885a.  The court, however, declined to remove her, stating that \xe2\x80\x9cshe answered candidly she\xe2\x80\x99s going to have an open mind now\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cagree[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to take her at her word.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 885a\xe2\x80\x93886a.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  As this Court has made plain, jurors\xe2\x80\x99 assurances of impartiality simply are not entitled to this sort of talismanic significance.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Murphy</em>, 421 U. S., at 800 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he juror\xe2\x80\x99s assurances that he is equal to th[e] task cannot be dispositive of the accused\xe2\x80\x99s rights\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Irvin</em>, 366 U. S., at 728 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere so many, so many times, admi[t] prejudice, \xe2\x80\xa6 a statement of impartiality can be given little weight\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Worse still, the District Court on a number of occasions accepted declarations of impartiality that were equivocal on their face.  Prospective jurors who \xe2\x80\x9chope[d]\xe2\x80\x9d they could presume innocence and did \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily\xe2\x80\x9d think Skilling was guilty were permitted to remain in the pool.  App. 932a, 857a.  Juror 61, for instance, wrote of Lay on her questionnaire, \xe2\x80\x9cShame on him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 931a.  Asked by the court about this, she stated that, \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent or guilty, he was at the helm\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cshould have known what was going on at the company.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id</em>., at 934a (Skilling is \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin the same boat as\xe2\x80\x9d Lay).  The court then asked, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you presume, as you start this trial, that Mr. Lay is innocent?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 932a.  She responded, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope so, but you know.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.  I can\xe2\x80\x99t honestly answer that one way or the other.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see also <em>id</em>., at 933a (\xe2\x80\x9cI bring in my past history.  I bring in my biases.  I would like to think I could rise above those, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never been in this situation before.  So I don\xe2\x80\x99t know how I could honestly answer that question one way or the other. \xe2\x80\xa6 I do have some concerns\xe2\x80\x9d).  Eventually, however, Juror 61 answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d when the court asked if she would be able to acquit if she had \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable doubt that the defendants are guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 933a\xe2\x80\x93934a.  Challenging her for cause, defense counsel insisted that they had not received \xe2\x80\x9ca clear and unequivocal answer\xe2\x80\x9d about her ability to be fair.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The court denied the challenge, stating, \xe2\x80\x9cYou know, she tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority takes solace in the fact that most of the persons actually seated as jurors and alternates \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically stated that they had paid scant attention to Enron-related news.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, and n. 26.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  In context, however, these general declarations reveal little about the seated jurors\xe2\x80\x99 actual knowledge or views or the possible pressure they might have felt to convict, and thus cannot instill confidence that the jurors \xe2\x80\x9cwere not under [the] sway\xe2\x80\x9d of the prevailing community sentiment.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 25.  Jurors who did not \xe2\x80\x9cget into details\xe2\x80\x9d of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s complicated accounting schemes, App. 856a, nevertheless knew the outline of the oft-repeated story, including that Skilling and Lay had been cast as the leading villains.  Juror 63, for instance, told the court that she \xe2\x80\x9cmay have heard a little bit\xe2\x80\x9d about Enron-related litigation but had not \xe2\x80\x9creally pa[id] attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 935a.  Yet she was clearly aware of some specifics.  On her questionnaire, despite stating that she had not followed Enron-related news, she wrote about \xe2\x80\x9cwhistleblowers and Arthur Andersen lying about Enron\xe2\x80\x99s accounting,\xe2\x80\x9d and she expressed the view that Skilling and Lay \xe2\x80\x9cprobably knew they were breaking the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 105sa\xe2\x80\x93106sa.  During questioning, which lasted barely four minutes, the District Court obtained no meaningful information about the actual extent of Juror 63\xe2\x80\x99s familiarity with the case or the basis for her belief in Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  Yet it nevertheless accepted her assurance that she could \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely\xe2\x80\x9d presume innocence.  App. 937a.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s anemic questioning did little to dispel similar doubts about the impartiality of numerous other seated jurors and alternates.  In my estimation, more than half of those seated made written and oral comments suggesting active antipathy toward the defendants.  The majority thus misses the mark when it asserts that \xe2\x80\x9cSkilling\xe2\x80\x99s seated jurors \xe2\x80\xa6 exhibited nothing like the display of bias shown in <em>Irvin</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 29.  Juror 10, for instance, reported on his written questionnaire that he knew several co-workers who owned Enron stock; that he personally may have owned Enron stock through a mutual fund; that he heard and read about the Enron cases from the \xe2\x80\x9cHouston Chronicle, all three Houston news channels, Fox news, talking with friends [and] co-workers, [and] Texas Lawyer Magazine\xe2\x80\x9d; that he believed Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse \xe2\x80\x9cwas due to greed and mismanagement\xe2\x80\x9d; that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f [Lay] did not know what was going on in his company, he was really a poor manager/leader\xe2\x80\x9d; and that the defendants were \xe2\x80\x9csuspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 11sa\xe2\x80\x9319sa.  During questioning, he said he \xe2\x80\x9cth[ought]\xe2\x80\x9d he could presume innocence and \xe2\x80\x9cbelieve[d]\xe2\x80\x9d he could put the Government to its proof, but he also acknowledged that he might have \xe2\x80\x9csome hesitancy\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin telling people the government didn\xe2\x80\x99t prove its case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 851a\xe2\x80\x93852a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Juror 11 wrote that he \xe2\x80\x9cwork[ed] with someone who worked at Enron\xe2\x80\x9d; that he got Enron-related news from the \xe2\x80\x9cHouston Chronicle, Channel 2 News, Channel 13 News, O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly Factor, [and] talking with friends and co-workers\xe2\x80\x9d; that he regularly visited the Chronicle Web site; that \xe2\x80\x9cgreed on Enron\xe2\x80\x99s part\xe2\x80\x9d caused the company\xe2\x80\x99s collapse; and that \xe2\x80\x9ca lot of people were hurt financially.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 26sa\xe2\x80\x9330sa.  During questioning, he stated that he would have \xe2\x80\x9cno problem\xe2\x80\x9d requiring the Government to prove its case, but he also told the court that he believed Lay was \xe2\x80\x9cgreedy\xe2\x80\x9d and that corporate executives are often \xe2\x80\x9cstretching the legal limits \xe2\x80\xa6 . I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re all crooks, but, you know.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 857a, 854a.  Asked whether he would \xe2\x80\x9cstar[t] the case with sort of an inkling that because [Lay is] greedy he must have done something illegal,\xe2\x80\x9d he offered an indeterminate \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessarily.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 857.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While several seated jurors and alternates did not make specific comments suggesting prejudice, their written and oral responses were so abbreviated as to make it virtually impossible for the District Court reliably to assess whether they harbored any latent biases.  Juror 13, for instance, wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about the Enron cases from the \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ews.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 42sa.  The court questioned him for two minutes, during which time he confirmed that he had \xe2\x80\x9cheard what\xe2\x80\x99s on the news, basically,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cthat the trial had moved from the 17th to the 31st.\xe2\x80\x9d  He added that the story \xe2\x80\x9cwas all over the news on every detail of Enron.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 858a\xe2\x80\x93860a.  No meaningful information about his knowledge or attitudes was obtained.  Similarly, Juror 78 wrote that she had not followed Enron-related news but was aware that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any people lost their jobs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Supp. App. 151sa.  The court questioned her for less than 90 seconds.  During that time, she acknowledged that she had \xe2\x80\x9ccaught glimpses\xe2\x80\x9d of the coverage and \xe2\x80\x9ckn[e]w generally, you know, that the company went bankrupt\xe2\x80\x9d and that there \xe2\x80\x9cwere some employees that went off and did their own businesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 969a.  Little more was learned.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In assessing the likelihood that bias lurked in the minds of at least some of these seated jurors, I find telling the way in which <em>voir dire </em>played out.  When the District Court asked the prospective jurors as a group whether they had any reservations about their ability to presume innocence and put the Government to its proof, only two answered in the affirmative, and both were excused for cause.  <em>Id</em>., at 815a\xe2\x80\x93820a.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s individual questioning, though truncated, exposed disqualifying prejudices among numerous additional prospective jurors who had earlier expressed no concerns about their impartiality.  See n.\xc2\xa07, <em>supra</em>.  It thus strikes me as highly likely that at least some of the seated jurors, despite stating that they could be fair, harbored similar biases that a more probing inquiry would likely have exposed.  Cf. <em>Yount</em>,\n467 U. S., at 1034, n.\xc2\xa010 (holding that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly extensive\xe2\x80\x9d 10-day <em>voir dire</em> assured the jury\xe2\x80\x99s impartiality).[<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests, <em>ante</em>, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, 30, that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s decision to acquit Skilling on nine relatively minor insider trading charges confirms its impartiality.  This argument, however, mistakes partiality with bad faith or blind vindictiveness.  Jurors who act in good faith and sincerely believe in their own fairness may nevertheless harbor disqualifying prejudices.  Such jurors may well acquit where evidence is wholly lacking, while subconsciously resolving closer calls against the defendant rather than giving him the benefit of the doubt.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>McVeigh</em>, 918 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1467, 1472 (WD Okla. 1996) (prejudice \xe2\x80\x9cmay go unrecognized in those who are affected by it.  The prejudice that may deny a fair trial is not limited to a bias or discriminatory attitude.  It includes an impairment of the deliberative process of deductive reasoning from evidentiary facts resulting from an attribution to something not included in the evidence.  That something has its most powerful effect if it generates strong emotional responses\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this regard, it is significant that the Government placed relatively little emphasis on the nine insider trading counts during its closing argument, declining to explain its theory on all but one of the counts in any detail whatsoever.  Record 37010.  The acquittals on those counts thus provide scant basis for inferring a lack of prejudice.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I cannot accept the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that <em>voir dire </em>gave the District Court \xe2\x80\x9ca sturdy foundation to assess fitness for jury service.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 29.  Taken together, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cover certain vital subjects, its superficial coverage of other topics, and its uncritical acceptance of assurances of impartiality leave me doubtful that Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury was indeed free from the deep-seated animosity that pervaded the community at large.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]egardless of the heinousness of the crime charged, the apparent guilt of the offender[,] or the station in life which he occupies,\xe2\x80\x9d our system of justice demands trials that are fair in both appearance and fact.  <em>Irvin</em>, 366 U.

In 2003, the Enron Task Force indicted numerous Enron employees, including Ben Glisan, Jr. (the company\xe2\x80\x99s treasurer), Lea Fastow (wife of Andrew and an assistant treasurer), and more than half a dozen executives of Enron Broadband Services; several Enron employees entered guilty pleas and received prison sentences; and Enron filed its bankruptcy reorganization plan.  In 2004, Andrew and Lea Fastow both pleaded guilty; Skilling and Causey were indicted in February; a superseding indictment adding Lay was filed in July; a number of additional Enron employees entered guilty pleas; and former Enron employees and Merrill Lynch bankers were defendants in a 6-week trial in Houston concerning an Enron deal involving the sale of Nigerian barges.  In 2005, a 3-month trial was held in Houston for five executives of Enron Broadband Services; various pretrial proceedings occurred in the run up to the trial of Skilling, Lay, and Causey; and, three weeks before the scheduled trial date, Causey pleaded guilty to securities fraud.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority points out that the jury selection processes in the three previous Enron trials that had been held in Houston were similarly brief.  See <em>ante</em>, at 23.  The circumstances of those cases, however, were very different.  In particular, the defendants had not been personally subjected to anything approaching the withering public criticism that had been directed at Skilling and Lay.  As earlier noted, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 25\xe2\x80\x9326, it was the trial of Skilling and Lay that was widely seen as the climactic event of the Enron saga.  Accordingly, my conclusion that the jury selection process in this unusual case did not suffice to select an impartial jury does not cast doubt on the adequacy of the processes used in the earlier Enron prosecutions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in referencing the length of the <em>voir dire</em> in this case, I do not mean to suggest that length should be a principal measure of the adequacy of a jury selection process.  Trial courts, including this one, should be commended for striving to be efficient, but they must always take care to ensure that their expeditiousness does not compromise a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s fair-trial right.  I also express no view with respect to court-led versus attorney-led <em>voir dire</em>.  Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 24(a) gives district courts discretion to choose between these options, and I have no doubt that either is capable of producing an impartial jury even in high profile cases so long as the trial court assures that the scope of the <em>voir dire </em>is tailored to the circumstances.</p>\n<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Juror 33 brought up the plea in response to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s question about whether he \xe2\x80\x9crecall[ed] listening to any particular programs about the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 888a.

See <em>ante</em>, at 30, n. 32.  The majority makes a similar point with respect to other venire members who were not ultimately seated.  See <em>ante</em>, at 24, n. 24.  The comments of these venire members, however, are relevant in assessing the impartiality of the seated jurors, who were similarly \xe2\x80\x9cpart of a community deeply hostile to the accused\xe2\x80\x9d and who may have been \xe2\x80\x9cunwittingly influenced by it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Murphy</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html"></a><a href="/us/421/794/index.html">421 U.

Moreover, the fact that the District Court failed to remove persons as dubiously qualified as Juror 29 goes directly to the adequacy of its <em>voir dire</em>.  If Juror 29 made it through to the end of the selection process, it is difficult to have confidence in the impartiality of the jurors who sat, especially given how little is known about many of them.  Cf. 6 LaFave \xc2\xa723.2(f), at 288 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe responses of those not seated casts light on the credibility of the seated jurors who were familiar with the same publicity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority also notes that about two-thirds of the seated jurors and alternates (11 of 16) had no personal Enron connection.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24, and n.\xc2\xa025.  This means, of course, that five of the seated jurors and alternates did have connections to friends or colleagues who had lost jobs or money as a result of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse\xe2\x80\x94a fact that does not strike me as particularly reassuring.</p>\n<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As one of Skilling\xe2\x80\x99s jury experts observed, there is a \xe2\x80\x9ctendency in voir dire of jury pool members in high-profile cases to minimize their exposure to media, their knowledge of prejudicial information, and any biases they may have.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 763a; see also <em>id</em>., at 637a (\xe2\x80\x9cThose who perceive themselves or wish to be perceived as good citizens are reluctant to admit they cannot be fair\xe2\x80\x9d).  For this reason, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the seated jurors and alternates checked the \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 box\xe2\x80\x9d on the written questionnaire when \xe2\x80\x9casked whether they \xe2\x80\x98ha[d] an opinion about [Skilling],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 26, is of minimal significance, particularly given that the Causey plea and the impending trial received significant media coverage <em>after</em> the questionnaires were submitted.</p>\n<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Many other seated jurors and alternates expressed similarly troubling sentiments.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Supp. App. 57sa\xe2\x80\x9360sa (Juror 20) (obtained Enron-related news from the Chronicle<em> </em>and \xe2\x80\x9clocal news stations\xe2\x80\x9d; blamed Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse on \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot enough corporate controls or effective audit procedures to prevent mismanagement of corporate assets\xe2\x80\x9d; and was \xe2\x80\x9cangry that so many people lost their jobs and their retirement savings\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 72sa\xe2\x80\x9375sa (Juror 38) (followed Enron-related news from various sources, including the Chronicle; was \xe2\x80\x9cangry about what happened\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cfe[lt] bad for those that worked hard and invested in the corp[oration] only to have it all taken away\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 117sa\xe2\x80\x93118sa (Juror 64) (had several friends who worked at Enron and lost money; heard about the Enron cases on the news; described the collapse as \xe2\x80\x9csad\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cpeople lost jobs [and] money\xe2\x80\x94lots of money\xe2\x80\x9d; and believed the Government \xe2\x80\x9cdid the right thing\xe2\x80\x9d in its investigation); <em>id</em>., at 177sa\xe2\x80\x93181sa (Juror 87) (received Enron-related news from the Chronicle, Channel 13 news, the O\xe2\x80\x99Reilly Factor, Internet news sources, and friends, family, and co-workers; attributed Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse to \xe2\x80\x9c[p]oor management [and] bad judgment\xe2\x80\x94greed\xe2\x80\x9d; lamented \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he sad state of the long-term loyal employees who are left with nothing in their retirement accounts\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9cadmire[d] [the] bravery\xe2\x80\x9d of Enron whistle-blower Sherron Watkins \xe2\x80\x9cfor bringing the situation to the attention of the public, which stopped things from getting worse\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 191sa\xe2\x80\x93195sa (Juror 90) (heard Enron-related news from his wife, co-workers, and television; wrote that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t\xe2\x80\x99s not right for someone \xe2\x80\xa6 to take\xe2\x80\x9d away the money that the \xe2\x80\x9csmall average worker saves \xe2\x80\xa6 for retirement all his life\xe2\x80\x9d; and described the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Enron investigation as \xe2\x80\x9ca good thing\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 221sa\xe2\x80\x93225sa (Juror 113) (obtained information about Enron from a \xe2\x80\x9cco-worker [who] was in the jury pool for Mrs. Fastow\xe2\x80\x99s trial\xe2\x80\x9d; worked for an employer who lost money as a result of Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse; found it \xe2\x80\x9csad\xe2\x80\x9d that the collapse had affected \xe2\x80\x9csuch a huge number of people\xe2\x80\x9d; and thought \xe2\x80\x9csomeone had to be doing something illegal\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 236sa\xe2\x80\x93237sa (Juror 116) (knew a colleague who lost money in Enron\xe2\x80\x99s collapse; obtained Enron-related news from the \xe2\x80\x9cHouston Chronicle, Time Magazine, local TV news [and] radio, friends, family, [and] co-workers, [and] internet news sources\xe2\x80\x9d; and noted\nthat what stood out was \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he employees and retirees that lost their savings\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Several other jurors fell into this category.  Juror 67 wrote on his questionnaire that he had heard about Enron from the Chronicle<em> </em>and \xe2\x80\x9cInternet news sources.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 133sa.  He was questioned for 90 seconds, during which time he indicated that he had read an article on the Internet the preceding night \xe2\x80\x9cabout the jury selection taking place today, stuff like that.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 944a.  Juror 99 wrote that she had not heard or read about the Enron cases and did not \xe2\x80\x9cknow anything about\xe2\x80\x9d Enron.  Supp. App. 210sa.  The District Court questioned her for barely one minute.  She stated that she had \xe2\x80\x9c[n]ot really\xe2\x80\x9d learned more about the case, but added that she had heard \xe2\x80\x9cthis and that\xe2\x80\x9d from her parents.  App. 995a\xe2\x80\x93996a.  The court did not press further.</p>\n<a href="#T25" name="F25">Footnote 25</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that the fact that Skilling \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged only one of the seated jurors for cause\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that he did not believe the other jurors were biased.  <em>Ante</em>, at 31.  Our decisions, however, distinguish claims involving \xe2\x80\x9cthe partiality of an individual juror\xe2\x80\x9d from antecedent claims directed at \xe2\x80\x9cthe partiality of the trial jury as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Patton</em> v. <em>Yount</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/1025/index.html">467 U.

If the jury selection process does not, as here, give a defendant a fair opportunity to identify biased jurors, the defendant can hardly be faulted for failing to make for-cause challenges.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
