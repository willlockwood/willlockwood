After an extensive series of state- and federal-court proceedings concluded with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petitions for certiorari and for rehearing, the Ninth Circuit declined to issue its mandate as normally required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D).  The Ninth Circuit instead, sua\xc2\xa0sponte, construed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to stay the mandate pending the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in a separate en banc case as a motion to reconsider a motion that it had denied six months earlier.  Based on its review of that previously rejected motion, the court issued a stay a few days before respondent\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled execution.  Even assuming, as we did in Bell v. Thompson, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 794 (2005)\n, that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) admits of any exceptions, the Ninth Circuit did not demonstrate that exceptional circumstances justified withholding its mandate.  As a result, we conclude that the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s failure to issue its mandate constituted an abuse of discretion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 1985, an Arizona jury found respondent guilty of first-degree murder for the 1978 strangling of 74-year-old Lorimer Grove.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The court sentenced respondent to death.  After respondent\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and sentence were affirmed on direct review, see State v. Schad, 163 Ariz. 411, 788 P.\xc2\xa02d 1162 (1989), and Schad v. Arizona, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 624 (1991)\n, respondent again sought state habeas relief, alleging that his trial counsel rendered ineffective assistance at sentencing by failing to discover and present sufficient mitigating evidence.  The state courts denied relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn August 1998, respondent sought federal habeas relief.  He again raised a claim of ineffective assistance at sentencing for failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence.  The District Court denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s request for an evidentiary hearing to present new mitigating evi- dence, concluding that respondent was not diligent in developing the evidence during his state habeas proceedings.  Schad v. Schriro, 454 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 897 (Ariz. 2006).  The District Court alternatively held that the proffered new evidence did not demonstrate that trial counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient.  Id., at 940\xe2\x80\x93947.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and remanded to the District Court for a hearing to determine whether respondent\xe2\x80\x99s state habeas counsel was diligent in developing the state evidentiary record.  Schad v. Ryan, 606 F.\xc2\xa03d 1022 (2010).  Arizona petitioned for certiorari.  This Court granted the petition, vacated the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and remanded for further proceedings in light of Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  See Ryan v. Schad, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  On remand, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of habeas relief.  Schad v. Ryan, 671 F.\xc2\xa03d 708, 726 (2011).  The Ninth Circuit subsequently denied a motion for rehearing and rehearing en banc on February 28, 2012.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn July 10, 2012, respondent filed in the Ninth Circuit the first motion directly at issue in this case.  This motion asked the court to vacate its judgment and remand to the District Court for additional proceedings in light of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Martinez v. Ryan, \n\n566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1 (2012)\n.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Ninth Circuit denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion on July 27, 2012.  Respondent then filed a petition for certiorari.  This Court denied the petition on October 9, 2012, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, and denied a petition for rehearing on January 7, 2013.  568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent returned to the Ninth Circuit that day and filed a motion requesting a stay of the mandate in light of a pending Ninth Circuit en banc case addressing the interaction between Pinholster and Martinez.  The Ninth Circuit denied the motion on February 1, 2013, \xe2\x80\x9cde- clin[ing] to issue an indefinite stay of the mandate that would unduly interfere with Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s execution process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Order in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9399005, Doc. 102, p.\xc2\xa01.  But instead of issuing the mandate, the court decided sua\xc2\xa0sponte to construe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion \xe2\x80\x9cas a motion to reconsider our prior denial of his Motion to Vacate Judgment and Remand in light of Martinez,\xe2\x80\x9d which the court had denied on July 27, 2012.  Id., at\xc2\xa02.  The court ordered briefing and, in a divided opinion, remanded the case to the District Court to determine whether respondent could establish that he received ineffective assistance of postconviction counsel un- der Martinez, whether he could demonstrate prejudice as a result, and whether his underlying claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel had merit.  No. 07\xe2\x80\x9399005 (Feb. 26, 2013), App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x9313 to A\xe2\x80\x9315, 2013 WL 791610, *6.  Judge Graber dissented based on her conclusion that respondent could not show prejudice.  Id., at A\xe2\x80\x9316 to A\xe2\x80\x9317, 2013 WL 791610, *7.  Arizona set an execution date of March 6, 2013, which prompted respondent to file a motion for stay of execution on February 26, 2013.  The Ninth Circuit panel granted the motion on March 1, 2013, with Judge Graber again noting her dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn March 4, 2013, Arizona filed a petition for rehearing and rehearing en banc with the Ninth Circuit.  The court denied the petition the same day, with eight judges dissenting in two separate opinions.  709 F.\xc2\xa03d 855 (2013).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn March 4, Arizona filed an application to vacate the stay of execution in this Court, along with a petition for certiorari.  This Court denied the application, with Jus- tices Scalia and Alito noting that they would grant it.  568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).  We now consider the petition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 41(d)(2)(D) sets forth the default rule that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he court of appeals must issue the mandate immediately when a copy of a Supreme Court order denying the petition for writ of certiorari is filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The reason for this Rule is straightforward: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he stay of mandate is entered solely to allow this Court time to consider a petition for certio- rari.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bell, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 806.  Hence, once this Court has denied a petition, there is generally no need for further action from the lower courts.  See ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] decision by this Court denying discretionary review usually signals the end of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  In Bell, Tennessee argued that Rule 41(d)(2)(D) \xe2\x80\x9cadmits of no exceptions, so the mandate should have issued on the date\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals received notice of the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of certiorari.  Id., at 803.  There was no need to resolve this issue in Bell because we concluded that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion even if Rule 41(d)(2)(D) authorized a stay of the mandate after denial of certiorari.  Id., at 803\xe2\x80\x93804.  As in Bell, we need not resolve this issue to determine that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBell recognized that when state-court judgments are reviewed in federal habeas proceedings, \xe2\x80\x9cfinality and comity concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d based in principles of federalism, demand that federal courts \xe2\x80\x9caccord the appropriate level of respect to\xe2\x80\x9d state judgments by allowing them to be enforced when federal proceedings conclude.  Id., at 812\xe2\x80\x93813. As we noted, States have an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cinterest in the finality of convictions that have survived direct review within the state court system.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 813 (quoting Calderon v. Thompson, \n\n523 U.\xc2\xa0S. 538, \n555 (1998)\n, in turn quoting Brecht v. Abrahamson, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 619, \n635 (1993)\n).  Elsewhere, we explained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the profound interests in repose\xe2\x80\x99 attaching to the mandate of a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d dictate that \xe2\x80\x9cthe power [to withdraw the mandate] can be exercised only in extraordinary circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Calderon, supra, at 550 (quoting 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa73938, p. 712 (2d ed. 1996)).  Deviation from normal mandate procedures is a power \xe2\x80\x9cof last resort, to be held in reserve against grave, unforeseen contingencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Calderon, supra, at 550.  Even assuming a court of appeals has authority to do so, it abuses its discretion when it refuses to issue the mandate once the Supreme Court has acted on the petition, unless extraordinary circumstances justify that action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying this standard in Bell, we found no extraordinary circumstances that could constitute a miscarriage of justice.  There, a capital defendant unsuccessfully alleged in state postconviction proceedings that his trial counsel had been ineffective by failing to introduce sufficient mitigating evidence in the penalty phase of trial.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 797.  On federal habeas review, he made the same argument.  Id., at 798.  After the Sixth Circuit affirmed, the defendant filed a petition for rehearing that \xe2\x80\x9cplaced substantial emphasis\xe2\x80\x9d on his argument that the Sixth Circuit had overlooked new psychiatrist evidence.  Id., at 800.  While the Sixth Circuit denied the petition, it stayed the issuance of its mandate while the defendant sought certiorari and, later, rehearing from the denial of the writ.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen this Court denied the petition for rehearing, the Sixth Circuit did not issue its mandate.  Instead, the Sixth Circuit waited five months (and until two days before the scheduled execution) to issue an amended opinion that va- cated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of habeas and remanded for an evidentiary hearing on the ineffective-assistance- of-counsel claim.  Id., at 800\xe2\x80\x93801.  This Court reversed that decision, holding that the Sixth Circuit had abused its discretion due to its delay in issuing the mandate without notifying the parties, its reliance on a previously rejected argument, and its disregard of comity and federalism principles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, the Ninth Circuit similarly abused its discretion when it did not issue the mandate.  As in Bell, the Ninth Circuit here declined to issue the mandate based on an argument it had considered and rejected months earlier.  And, by the time of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s February 1, 2013, decision not to issue its mandate, it had been over 10 months since we decided Martinez and nearly 7 months since respondent unsuccessfully asked the Ninth Circuit to reconsider its decision in light of Martinez.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, there is no doubt that the arguments presented in the rejected July 10, 2012, motion were identical to those accepted by the Ninth Circuit the following February.  Respondent styled his July 10 motion a \xe2\x80\x9cMotion to Vacate Judgment and Remand to the District Court for Additional Proceedings in Light of Martinez v. Ryan.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. 07\xe2\x80\x9399005 (CA9), Doc. 88, p.\xc2\xa01.  As its title suggests, the only claim presented in that motion was that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction counsel should have developed more evidence to support his ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claim.  Here, as in Bell, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s July 10 motion \xe2\x80\x9cpressed the same arguments that eventually were adopted by the Court of Appeals.\xe2\x80\x9d 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 806.  These ar- guments were pressed so strongly in the July 10 motion that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is difficult to see how .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. counsel could have been clearer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 808.  The Ninth Circuit had a full \xe2\x80\x9copportunity to consider these arguments\xe2\x80\x9d but declined to do so, id., at 806, which \xe2\x80\x9csupport[s] our determination that the decision to withhold the mandate was in error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 806\xe2\x80\x93807.  We presume that the Ninth Circuit carefully considers each motion a capital defendant presents on habeas review.  See id., at 808 (rejecting the notion that \xe2\x80\x9cjudges cannot be relied upon to read past the first page of a petition for rehearing\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, there is no indication that there were any extraordinary circumstances here that called for the court to revisit an argument sua\xc2\xa0sponte that it already explicitly rejected.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, this case presents an additional issue not present in Bell.  In refusing to issue the mandate, the Ninth Circuit panel relied heavily upon Beardslee v. Brown, 393 F.\xc2\xa03d 899, 901 (CA9 2004) (per curiam), Beardslee, which precedes our Bell decision by more than six months, asserts the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s inherent authority to withhold a mandate.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. A\xe2\x80\x933 to A\xe2\x80\x934, 2013 WL 791610, *1.  But Beardslee was based on the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Bell, which we reversed.  See Beardslee, supra, at 901 (citing Thompson v. Bell, 373 F.\xc2\xa03d 688, 691\xe2\x80\x93692 (2004)).  That opinion, thus, provides no support for the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the foregoing, we hold that the Ninth Circuit abused its discretion when it neglected to issue its mandate.  The petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is reversed, the stay of execution is vacated, and the case is remanded with instructions to issue the mandate immediately and without any further proceedings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0A state habeas court vacated an earlier guilty verdict and death sentence due to an error in jury instructions.
