On that day, his policy of yearly renewable term insurance lapsed for nonpayment of premium. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 319 U. S. 373</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The suit was filed June 15, 1938.  At the close of all the evidence, the District Court granted the Government\'s motion for a directed verdict.  Judgment was entered accordingly.  The Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed.  130 F.2d 467.  Both courts held the evidence legally insufficient to sustain a verdict for petitioner.  He says this was erroneous and, in effect, deprived him of trial by jury, contrary to the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n<p>The constitutional argument, as petitioner has made it, does not challenge generally the power of federal courts to withhold or withdraw from the jury cases in which the claimant puts forward insufficient evidence to support a verdict. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The contention is merely that his case as made was substantial, the courts\' decisions to the contrary were wrong, and therefore their effect has been to deprive him of a jury trial.  Petitioner relies particularly upon <em>Halliday v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/94/case.html">315 U. S. 94</a></span>, and <em>Berry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/450/case.html">312 U. S. 450</a></span>, citing also <em>Gunning v. Cooley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/90/case.html">281 U. S. 90</a></span>.  These cases and others relied upon are distinguishable upon the facts, as will appear.  Upon the record and the issues as the parties have made them, the only question is whether the evidence was sufficient to sustain a verdict for petitioner.  On that basis, we think the judgments must be affirmed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Certain facts are undisputed.  Petitioner worked as a longshoreman in Philadelphia and elsewhere prior to enlistment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 319 U. S. 374</a></p><p> in the Army November 1, 1917. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  He became a cook in a machine gun battalion.  His unit arrived in France in April, 1918.  He served actively until September 24.  From then to the following January, he was in a hospital with influenza.  He then returned to active duty.  He came back to the United States, and received honorable discharge April 29, 1919.  He enlisted in the Navy January 15, 1920, and was discharged for bad conduct in July.  The following December, he again enlisted in the Army, and served until May, 1922, when he deserted.  Thereafter, he was carried on the Army records as a deserter.</p>\n<p>In 1930 began a series of medical examinations by Veterans\' Bureau physicians.  On May 19 that year, his condition was diagnosed as "Moron, low grade; observation, dementia praecox, simple type."  In November, 1931, further examination gave the diagnosis, "Psychosis with other diseases or conditions (organic disease of the central nervous system -- type undetermined)."  In July, 1934, still another examination was made, with diagnosis:</p>\n<p>"Psychosis manic and depressive insanity incompetent; hypertension, moderate; otitis media, chronic, left; varicose veins left, mild; abscessed teeth roots; myocarditis, mild."</p>\n<p>Petitioner\'s wife, the nominal party in this suit, was appointed guardian of his person and estate in February, 1932.  Claim for insurance benefits was made in June, 1934, and was finally denied by the Board of Veterans\' Appeals in January, 1936.  This suit followed two and a half years later.</p>\n<p>Petitioner concededly is now totally and permanently disabled by reason of insanity, and has been for some time prior to institution of this suit.  It is conceded also that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 319 U. S. 375</a></p><p> he was sound in mind and body until he arrived in France in April, 1918.</p>\n<p>The theory of his case is that the strain of active service abroad brought on an immediate change, which was the beginning of a mental breakdown that has grown worse continuously through all the later years.  Essential in this is the view it had become a total and permanent disability not later than May 31, 1919.</p>\n<p>The evidence to support this theory falls naturally into three periods, namely, that, prior to 1923; the interval from then to 1930, and that following 1930.  It consists in proof of incidents occurring in France to show the beginnings of change; testimony of changed appearance and behavior in the years immediately following petitioner\'s return to the United States as compared with those prior to his departure; the medical evidence of insanity accumulated in the years following 1930, and finally the evidence of a physician, given largely as medical opinion, which seeks to tie all the other evidence together as foundation for the conclusion, expressed as of 1941, that petitioner\'s disability was total and permanent as of a time not later than May of 1919.</p>\n<p>Documentary exhibits included military, naval, and Veterans\' Bureau records.  Testimony was given by deposition or at the trial chiefly by five witnesses.  One, O\'Neill, was a fellow worker and friend from boyhood; two, Wells and Tanikawa, served with petitioner overseas; Lt. Col. Albert K. Mathews, who was an Army chaplain, observed him or another person of the same name at an Army hospital in California during early 1920, and Dr. Wilder, a physician, examined him shortly before the trial and supplied the only expert testimony in his behalf.  The petitioner also put into evidence the depositions of Commander Platt and Lt. Col. James E. Matthews, his superior officers in the Navy and the Army, respectively, during 1920-22. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="376">Page 319 U. S. 376</a></p><p></p>\n<p>What happened in France during 1918-19 is shown chiefly by Wells and Tanikawa.  Wells testified to an incident at Aisonville, where the unit was billeted shortly after reaching France and before going into action.  Late at night, petitioner created a disturbance, "hollering, screeching, swearing. . . .  The men poured out from the whole section."  Wells did not see the incident, but heard petitioner swearing at his superior officers and saw "the result, a black eye for Lt. Warner."  However, he did not see "who gave it to him." [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Wells personally observed no infraction of discipline except this incident, and did not know what brought it on.  Petitioner\'s physical appearance was good, he "carried on his duties as a cook all right," and the witness did not see him after June 1, except for about three days in July when he observed petitioner several times at work feeding stragglers.</p>\n<p>Tanikawa, Hawaiian-born citizen, served with petitioner from the latter\'s enlistment until September, 1918, when Galloway was hospitalized, although the witness thought they had fought together and petitioner was "acting queer" at the Battle of the Argonne in October.  At Camp Greene, North Carolina, petitioner was "just a regular soldier, very normal, . . . pretty neat."  After reaching France, "he was getting nervous, . . . kind of irritable, always picking a fight with other soldier."  This began at Aisonville.  Tanikawa saw Galloway in jail, apparently before June.  It is not clear whether these are references to the incident Wells described.</p>\n<p>Tanikawa described another incident in June "when we were on the Marne," the Germans "were on the other side, and we were on this side."  It was a new front, without trenches.  The witness and petitioner were on guard duty with others.  Tanikawa understood the Germans </p><p><a class="page-number" name="377">Page 319 U. S. 377</a></p><p> were getting ready for a big drive.  "One night he [petitioner] screamed.  He said, <em>The Germans are coming,\' and we all gagged him."  There was no shooting, the Germans were not coming, and there was nothing to lead the witness to believe they were.  Petitioner was court-martialed for the matter, but Tanikawa did not know "what they did with him."  He did not talk with Galloway that night, because "he was out of his mind" and appeared insane.  Tanikawa did not know when petitioner left the battalion or what happened to him after (as the witness put it) the Argonne fight, but heard he went to the hospital, "just dressing station I guess."  The witness next saw Galloway in 1936 at a disabled veterans\' post meeting in Sacramento, California.   Petitioner then "looked to me like he wasn\'t all there.  Insane.  About the same . . . as compared to the way he acted in France, particularly when they gagged him. . . ."\n</em></p>\n<p>O\'Neill was "born and raised with" petitioner, worked with him as a longshoreman, and knew him "from when he come out of the army for seven years, . . . I would say five or six years."  When petitioner returned in April or May, 1919, "he was a wreck compared to what he was when he went away.  The fellow\'s mind was evidently unbalanced."  Symptoms specified were withdrawing to himself; crying spells; alternate periods of normal behavior and nonsensical talk; expression of fears that good friends wanted "to beat him up;" spitting blood and remarking about it in vulgar terms.  Once petitioner said, "G-d-it, I must be a Doctor Jekyll and Mr. Hyde."</p>\n<p>O\'Neill testified these symptoms and this condition continued practically the same for about five years.  In his opinion, petitioner was "competent at times and others was incompetent."  The intervals might be "a couple of days, a couple of months."  In his normal periods, Galloway "would be his old self . . . absolutely O.K." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 319 U. S. 378</a></p><p></p>\n<p>O\'Neill was definite in recalling petitioner\'s condition and having seen him frequently in 1919, chiefly however, and briefly, on the street during lunch hour.  He was not sure Galloway was working, and was "surprised he got in the Navy, I think in the Navy or in the Government service."</p>\n<p>O\'Neill maintained he saw petitioner "right on from that [1920] at times."  But his recollection of dates, number of opportunities for observation, and concrete events was wholly indefinite.  He would fix no estimate for the number of times he had seen petitioner:  "In 1920, I couldn\'t recall whether it was one or a thousand."  For later years, he would not say whether it was "five times or more or less."  When he was pinned down by cross-examination, the effect of his testimony was that he recalled petitioner clearly in 1919 "because there was such a vast contrast in the man," but, for later years, he could give little or no definite information.  The excerpt from the testimony set forth in the margin [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] shows this contrast.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 319 U. S. 379</a></p><p> We also summarize below [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] other evidence which explains or illustrates the vagueness of the witness\' recollection for events after 1919.  O\'Neill recalled one specific occasion after 1919 when petitioner returned to Philadelphia, "around 1920 or 1921, but I couldn\'t be sure," to testify in a criminal proceeding.  He also said,</p>\n<p>"After he was away for five or six years, he came back to Philadelphia, but I wouldn\'t know nothing about dates on that.  He was back in Philadelphia for five or six months or so, and he was still just evidently all right, and then he would be off."</p>\n<p>Lt. Col. (Chaplain) Mathews said he observed a Private Joseph Galloway, who was a prisoner for desertion and a patient in the mental ward at Fort MacArthur Station </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 319 U. S. 380</a></p><p> Hospital, California, during a six weeks period early in 1920.  The chaplain\'s testimony gives strong evidence the man he observed was insane.  However, there is a fatal weakness in this evidence.  In his direct testimony, which was taken by deposition, the chaplain said he was certain that the soldier was petitioner.  When confronted with the undisputed fact that petitioner was on active duty in the Navy during the first half of 1920, the witness at first stated that he might have been mistaken as to the time of his observation.  Subsequently he reasserted the accuracy of his original statement as to the time of observation, but admitted that he might have been mistaken in believing that the patient-prisoner was petitioner.  In this connection, he volunteered the statement, "Might I add, sir, that I could not now identify that soldier if I were to meet him face to face, and that is because of the long lapse of time."  The patient whom the witness saw was confined to his bed.  The record is barren of other evidence, whether by the hospital\'s or the Army\'s records or otherwise, to show that petitioner was either patient or prisoner at Fort MacArthur in 1920 or at any other time.</p>\n<p>Commander Platt testified that petitioner caused considerable trouble by disobedience and leaving ship without permission during his naval service in the first half of 1920.  After "repeated warnings and punishments, leading to court-martials," he was sentenced to a bad conduct discharge.</p>\n<p>Lt. Col. James E. Matthews (not the chaplain) testified by deposition which petitioner\'s attorney interrupted Dr. Wilder\'s testimony to read into evidence.  The witness was Galloway\'s commanding officer from early 1921 to the summer of that year, when petitioner was transferred with other soldiers to another unit.  At first, Colonel Matthews considered making petitioner a corporal, but found him unreliable and had to discipline him.  Petitioner "drank </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 319 U. S. 381</a></p><p> considerably," was "what we called a bolshevik," did not seem loyal, and "acted as if he was not getting a square deal."  The officer concluded "he was a moral pervert, and probably used narcotics," but could not secure proof of this.  Galloway was court-martialed for public drunkenness and disorderly conduct, served a month at hard labor, and returned to active duty.  At times he "was one of the very best soldiers I had," at others undependable.  He was physically sound, able to do his work, perform close order drill, etc., "very well."  He had alternate periods of gaiety and depression, talked incoherently at times, gave the impression he would fight readily, but did not resent orders and seemed to get along well with other soldiers.  The officer attributed petitioner\'s behavior to alcohol and narcotics, and it occurred to him at no time to question his sanity.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wilder was the key witness.  He disclaimed specializing in mental disease, but qualified as having given it "special attention."  He first saw petitioner shortly before the trial, examined him "several times."  He concluded petitioner\'s ailment "is a schizophrenic branch or form of praecox."  Dr. Wilder heard the testimony and read the depositions of the other witnesses and examined the documentary evidence.  Basing his judgment upon this material, with inferences drawn from it, he concluded petitioner was born with "an inherent instability," though he remained normal until he went to France; began there "to be subjected to the strain of military life, then he began to go to pieces."  In May, 1919, petitioner "was still suffering from the acuteness of the breakdown. . . .  He is going down hill still, but the thing began with the breakdown. . . ."  Petitioner was "definitely insane, yes, sir," in 1920 and "has been insane at all times, at least since July, 1918, the time of this episode on the Marne" -- that is, "to the point that he was unable to adapt himself.  I don\'t mean he has not had moments when he could not perform some routine tasks," but, "from an occupational </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 319 U. S. 382</a></p><p> standpoint . . . he has been insane."  He could follow "a mere matter of routine," but would have no incentive, would not keep a steady job, come to work on time, or do anything he didn\'t want to do.  Dr. Wilder pointed to petitioner\'s work record before he entered the service and observed:  "At no time after he went into the war do we find him able to hold any kind of a job.  He broke right down."  He explained petitioner\'s enlistment in the Navy and later in the Army by saying, "It would have been no trick at all <em>for a man who was reasonably conforming</em> to get into the Service."  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>However, the witness knew "nothing whatever except his getting married" about petitioner\'s activities between 1925 and 1930, and what he knew of them between 1922 and 1925 was based entirely on O\'Neill\'s testimony and a paper not of record here. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Dr. Wilder at first regarded knowledge concerning what petitioner was doing between 1925 and 1930 as not essential.</p>\n<p>"We have a continuing disease, quite obviously beginning during his military service, and quite obviously continuing in 1930, and <em>the minor incidents</em> don\'t seem to me . . ."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Counsel for the government interrupted to inquire, "Well, if he was continuously employed for eight hours a day from 1925 to 1930, would that have any hearing?"  The witness replied, "It would have a great deal."  Upon further questioning, however, he reverted to his first position, stating it would not be necessary or helpful for him to know what petitioner was doing from 1925 to 1930:  "I testified from the information I had."</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This, we think, is the crux of the case, and distinguishes it from the cases on which petitioner has relied. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  His burden </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 319 U. S. 383</a></p><p> was to prove total and permanent disability as of a date not later than May 31, 1919.  He has undertaken to do this by showing incipience of mental disability shortly before that time and its continuance and progression throughout the succeeding years.  He has clearly established incidence of total and permanent disability as of some period prior to 1938, when he began this suit. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  For our purposes, this may be taken as medically established by the Veterans\' Bureau examination and diagnosis of July, 1934. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>But, if the record is taken to show that some form of mental disability existed in 1930, which later became total and permanent, petitioner\'s problem remains to demonstrate by more than speculative inference that this condition itself began on or before May 31, 1919, and continuously </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 319 U. S. 384</a></p><p> existed or progressed through the intervening years to 1930.</p>\n<p>To show origin before the crucial date, he gives evidence of two abnormal incidents occurring while he was in France, one creating the disturbance before he came near the fighting front, the other yelling that the Germans were coming when he was on guard duty at the Marne.  There is no other evidence of abnormal behavior during his entire service of more than a year abroad.</p>\n<p>That he was court-martialed for these sporadic acts and bound and gagged for one does not prove he was insane, or had then a general breakdown in "an already fragile mental constitution," which the vicissitudes of a longshoreman\'s life had not been able to crack.</p>\n<p>To these two incidents petitioner adds the testimony of O\'Neill that he looked and acted like a wreck, compared with his former self, when he returned from France about a month before the crucial date, and O\'Neill\'s vague recollections that this condition continued through the next two, three, four, or five years.</p>\n<p>O\'Neill\'s testimony apparently takes no account of petitioner\'s having spent 101 days in a hospital in France with influenza just before he came home.  But, given the utmost credence, as is required, it does no more than show that petitioner was subject to alternating periods of gaiety and depression for some indefinite period after his return, extending perhaps as late as 1922.  But because of its vagueness as to time, dates, frequency of opportunity for observation, and specific incident, O\'Neill\'s testimony concerning the period from 1922 to 1925 is hardly more than speculative.</p>\n<p>We have, then, the two incidents in France, followed by O\'Neill\'s testimony of petitioner\'s changed condition in 1919 and its continuance to 1922. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  There is also the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 319 U. S. 385</a></p><p> testimony of Commander Platt and Lt. Col. James E. Matthews as to his service in the Navy and the Army, respectively, during 1920-1922.  Neither thought petitioner was insane, or that his conduct indicated insanity.  Then follows a chasm of eight years.  The only evidence [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] we have concerning this period is the fact that petitioner married his present guardian at some time within it, an act from which in the legal sense no inference of insanity can be drawn.</p>\n<p>This period was eight years of continuous insanity, according to the inference petitioner would be allowed to have drawn.  If so, he should have no need of inference.  Insanity so long and continuously sustained does not hide itself from the eyes and ears of witnesses. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The assiduity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 319 U. S. 386</a></p><p> which produced the evidence of two "crazy" incidents during a year and a half in France should produce one during eight years or, for that matter, five years in the United States.</p>\n<p>Inference is capable of bridging many gaps.  But not, in these circumstances, one so wide and deep as this.  Knowledge of petitioner\'s activities and behavior from 1922 or 1925 to 1930 was peculiarly within his ken and that of his wife, who has litigated this cause in his and presumably, though indirectly, in her own behalf.  His was the burden to show continuous disability.  What he did in this time, or did not do, was vital to his case.  Apart from the mere fact of his marriage, the record is blank for five years, and almost blank for eight.  For all that appears, he may have worked full time and continuously for five and perhaps for eight, with only a possible single interruption. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>No favorable inference can be drawn from the omission.  It was not one of oversight or inability to secure proof.  That is shown by the thoroughness with which the record was prepared for all other periods, before and after this one, and by the fact petitioner\'s wife, though she married him during the period and was available, did not testify.  The only reasonable conclusion is that petitioner, or those who acted for him, deliberately chose, for reasons no doubt considered sufficient (and which we do not criticize, since </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 319 U. S. 387</a></p><p> such matters including tactical ones, are for the judgment of counsel) to present no evidence, or perhaps to withhold evidence readily available, concerning this long interval, and to trust to the genius of expert medical inference and judicial laxity to bridge this canyon.</p>\n<p>In the circumstances exhibited, the former is not equal to the feat, and the latter will not permit it.  No case has been cited, and none has been found, in which inference, however expert, has been permitted to make so broad a leap and take the place of evidence which, according to all reason, must have been at hand. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  To allow this would permit the substitution of inference, tenuous at best, not merely for evidence absent because impossible or difficult to secure, but for evidence disclosed to be available and not produced.  This would substitute speculation for proof.  Furthermore, the inference would be more plausible, perhaps, if the evidence of insanity as of May, 1919, were stronger than it is -- such for instance, as Chaplain Mathews\' testimony would have furnished if it could be taken as applying to petitioner.  But, on this record, the evidence of insanity as of that time is thin, at best, if it can be regarded as at all more than speculative. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Beyond this, there is nothing to show totality or permanence.  These come only by what the Circuit Court of Appeals rightly characterized as "long-range retroactive diagnosis."  That might suffice, notwithstanding this crucial inference was a matter of opinion, if there were factual evidence over which the medical eye could travel and find continuity through the intervening years.  <em>Cf.

In view of the ground upon which we have placed the decision, we need not consider these matters.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>What has been said disposes of the case as the parties have made it.  For that reason, perhaps nothing more need be said.  But objection has been advanced that, in some manner not wholly clear, the directed verdict practice offends the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n<p>It may be noted, first, that the Amendment has no application of its own force to this case.  The suit is one to enforce a monetary claim against the United States.  It hardly can be maintained that, under the common law in 1791, jury trial was a matter of right for persons asserting claims against the sovereign. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Whatever force the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 319 U. S. 389</a></p><p> Amendment has therefore is derived because Congress, in the legislation cited, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] has made it applicable.  Even so, the objection made on the score of its requirements is untenable.</p>\n<p>If the intention is to claim generally that the Amendment deprives the federal courts of power to direct a verdict for insufficiency of evidence, the short answer is the contention has been foreclosed by repeated decisions made here consistently for nearly a century. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  More recently, the practice has been approved explicitly in the promulgation of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.  <em>Cf.</em> Rule 50; <em>Berry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/450/case.html">312 U. S. 450</a></span>.  The objection therefore comes too late.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the argument from history is not convincing.  It is not that "the rules of the common law" in 1791 deprived trial courts of power to withdraw cases from the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 319 U. S. 390</a></p><p> jury, because not made out, or appellate courts of power to review such determinations.  The jury was not absolute master of fact in 1791.  Then, as now, courts excluded evidence for irrelevancy and relevant proof for other reasons. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The argument concedes they weighed the evidence not only piecemeal, but <em>in toto,</em> for submission to the jury, by at least two procedures, the demurrer to the evidence and the motion for a new trial.  The objection is not, therefore, to the basic thing, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] which is the power of the court to withhold cases from the jury or set aside the verdict for insufficiency of the evidence.  It is, rather, to incidental or collateral effects -- namely, that the directed verdict as now administered differs from both those procedures because, on the one hand, allegedly higher standards of proof are required and, on the other, different consequences follow as to further maintenance of the litigation.  Apart from the standards of proof, the argument appears to urge that, in 1791, a litigant could challenge his opponent\'s evidence either by the demurrer, which when determined ended the litigation, or by motion for a new trial, which, if successful, gave the adversary another chance to prove his case, and therefore the Amendment excluded any challenge to which one or the other of these consequences does not attach.</p>\n<p>The Amendment did not bind the federal courts to the exact procedural incidents or details of jury trial according to the common law in 1791 any more than it tied them to the common law system of pleading or the specific rules of evidence then prevailing. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Nor were "the rules of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 319 U. S. 391</a></p><p> common law" then prevalent, including those relating to the procedure by which the judge regulated the jury\'s role on questions of fact, crystalized in a fixed and immutable system . On the contrary, they were constantly changing and developing during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  In 1791, this process already had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 319 U. S. 392</a></p><p> resulted in widely divergent common law rules on procedural matters among the states and between them and England. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  And none of the contemporaneous rules regarding judicial control of the evidence going to juries or its sufficiency to support a verdict had reached any precise, much less final, form. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  In addition, the passage of time has obscured much of the procedure which then may have had more or less definite form, even for historical purposes. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>This difficulty no doubt accounts for the amorphous character of the objection now advanced, which insists not that any single one of the features criticized, but that the cumulative total or the alternative effect of all, was embodied in the Amendment.  The more logical conclusion, we think, and the one which both history and the previous decisions here support, is that the Amendment was designed to preserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most fundamental elements, not the great mass of procedural forms and details, varying even then so widely among common law jurisdictions. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>Apart from the uncertainty and the variety of conclusion which follows from an effort at purely historical accuracy, the consequences flowing from the view asserted are sufficient to refute it.  It may be doubted that the Amendment requires challenge to an opponent\'s case to be made without reference to the merits of one\'s own and at the price of all opportunity to have it considered.  On the other hand, there is equal room for disbelieving it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 319 U. S. 393</a></p><p> compels endless repetition of litigation and unlimited chance, by education gained at the opposing party\'s expense, for perfecting a case at other trials.  The essential inconsistency of these alternatives would seem sufficient to refute that either or both, to the exclusion of all others, received constitutional sanctity by the Amendment\'s force.  The first alternative, drawn from the demurrer to the evidence, attributes to the Amendment the effect of forcing one admission because another and an entirely different one is made, [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] and thereby compels conclusion of the litigation once and for all.  The true effect of imposing such a risk would not be to guarantee the plaintiff a jury trial.  It would be, rather, to deprive the defendant (or the plaintiff if he were the challenger) of that right, or, if not that, then of the right to challenge the legal sufficiency of the opposing case.  The Amendment was not framed or adopted to deprive either party of either right.  It is impartial in its guaranty of both.  To posit assertion of one upon sacrifice of the other would dilute and distort the full protection intended.  The admitted validity of the practice on the motion for a new trial goes far to demonstrate this. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  It negatives any idea </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 319 U. S. 394</a></p><p> that the challenge must be made at such a risk as the demurrer imposed.  As for the other alternative, it is not urged that the Amendment guarantees another trial whenever challenge to the sufficiency of evidence is sustained.  <em>Cf. Berry v. United States, supra.</em>  That argument, in turn, is precluded by the practice on demurrer to the evidence.</p>\n<p>Each of the classical modes of challenge, therefore, disproves the notion that the characteristic feature of the other, for effect upon continuing the litigation, became a part of the Seventh Amendment\'s guaranty to the exclusion of all others.  That guaranty did not incorporate conflicting constitutional policies, that challenge to an opposing case must be made with the effect of terminating the litigation finally and, at the same time, with the opposite effect of requiring another trial.  Alternatives so contradictory give room not for the inference that one or the other is required, but rather for the view that neither is essential. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="395">Page 319 U. S. 395</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Finally, the objection appears to be directed generally at the standards of proof judges have required for submission of evidence to the jury.  But standards, contrary to the objection\'s assumption, cannot be framed wholesale for the great variety of situations in respect to which the question arises. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  Nor is the matter greatly aided by substituting one general formula for another.  It hardly affords help to insist upon "substantial evidence," rather than "some evidence" or "any evidence," or vice versa.  The matter is essentially one to be worked out in particular situations and for particular types of cases.  Whatever may be the general formulation, the essential requirement is that mere speculation be not allowed to do duty for probative facts, after making due allowance for all reasonably possible inferences favoring the party whose case is attacked.  The mere difference in labels used to describe this standard, whether it is applied under the demurrer to the evidence [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>] or on motion for a directed verdict, cannot amount to a departure from "the rules of the common law" which the Amendment requires to be followed. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  If there is abuse in this respect, the obvious remedy is by correction on appellate review. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="396">Page 319 U. S. 396</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Judged by this requirement, or by any standard other than sheer speculation, we are unable to conclude that one whose burden, by the nature of his claim, is to show continuing and total disability for nearly twenty years supplies the essential proof of continuity when he wholly omits to show his whereabouts, activities, or condition for five years, although the record discloses evidence must have been available, and, further, throws no light upon three additional years, except for one vaguely described and dated visit to his former home.  Nothing in the Seventh Amendment requires it should be allowed to join forces with the jury system to bring about such a result.  That guaranty requires that the jury be allowed to make reasonable inferences from facts proven in evidence having a reasonable tendency to sustain them.  It permits expert opinion to have the force of fact when based on facts which sustain it.  But it does not require that experts or the jury be permitted to make inferences from the withholding of crucial facts, favorable in their effects to the party who has the evidence of them in his peculiar knowledge and possession, but elects to keep it so.  The words "total and permanent" are the statute\'s, not our own.  They mean something more than incipient or occasional disability.  We hardly need add that we give full credence to all of the testimony.  But that cannot cure its inherent vagueness or supply essential elements omitted or withheld.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the judgment is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The contract was issued pursuant to the War Risk Insurance Act, and insured against death or total permanent disability.

As is noted in the text, O\'Neill was not sure he was working, and "was surprised he got in the Navy, I think in the Navy or in the Government service."  He only "heard some talk" of petitioner\'s having reenlisted in the Army, but "<em>if it was the fact,</em> I would be surprised that he could do it owing to his mental condition."  (Emphasis added.)  O\'Neill was not certain that he saw Galloway in uniform after the first week of his return to Philadelphia from overseas, although he said he saw petitioner during "the periods of those reenlistments . . . but I can\'t recall about it."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>It is to be noted the witness did not refer to Chaplain Mathews\' testimony.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>None of them exhibits a period of comparable length as to which evidence is wholly lacking and under circumstances which preclude inference the omission was unintentional.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>He has not established a fixed date at which contemporaneous medical examination, both physical and mental, establishes totality and permanence prior to Dr. Wilder\'s examinations in 1941.</p>\n<p>Dr. Wilder testified that, on the evidence concerning petitioner\'s behavior at the time of his discharge in 1919, and without reference to the testimony as to later conduct, including O\'Neill\'s, he would reserve his opinion on whether petitioner was then "crazy" -- "I wouldn\'t have enough. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The previous examinations of 1930 and 1931 show possibility of mental disease, in the one case, and existence of psychosis with other disease, organic in character but with type undetermined, in the other.  These two examinations, without more, do not prove existence of total and permanent disability; on the contrary, they go far toward showing it could not be established then medically.</p>\n<p>The 1930 diagnosis shows only that the examiner regarded petitioner as a moron of low grade, and recommended he be observed for simple dementia praecox.  Dr. Wilder found no evidence in 1941 that petitioner was a moron.  The 1931 examination is even less conclusive in one respect, namely, that "psychosis" takes the place of moronic status.  Dr. Wilder also disagreed with this diagnosis.  However, this examination first indicates existence of organic nervous disease.  Not until the 1934 diagnosis is there one which might be regarded as showing possible total and permanent disability by medical evidence contemporaneous with the fact.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>Chaplain Mathews\' testimony would be highly probative of insanity existing early in 1920 if petitioner were sufficiently identified as its subject.  However, the bare inference of identity which might otherwise be drawn from the mere identity of names cannot be made reasonably in view of its overwhelming contradiction by other evidence presented by petitioner and the failure to produce records from Fort MacArthur Hospital or the Army or from persons who knew the fact that petitioner had been there at any time.  The omission eloquently testifies in a manner which no inference could overcome that petitioner never was there.  The chaplain\'s testimony therefore should have been stricken, had the case gone to the jury, and petitioner can derive no aid from it here.</p>\n<p>Tanikawa, it may be recalled, did not profess to have seen petitioner between October, 1918, and 1936.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>Apart from O\'Neill\'s vague recollection of petitioner\'s return to Philadelphia on one occasion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The only attempt to explain the absence of testimony concerning the period from 1922 to 1930 is made by counsel in the reply brief:</p>\n<p>"The insured, it will be observed, was never apprehended after his desertion from the Army in 1922.  It is only reasonable that a person with the status of a deserter at large . . . whose mind was in the condition of that of this insured, would absent himself from those with whom he would usually associate because of fear of apprehension and punishment.  His mental condition . . . at the time of trial . . . clearly shows that he could not have testified. . . .  A lack of testimony from 1922 to 1930 is thus explained, and the jury could well infer that only the then [1941?] admittedly insane insured was in a position to know where he was and what he was doing during those years; as he had lost his mental faculties, the reason for lack of proof during these years is apparent."</p>\n<p>The "explanation" is obviously untenable.  It ignores the one fact proved with relation to the period -- that petitioner was married during it.  His wife was nominally a party to the suit, and obviously available as a witness.  It disregards the fact petitioner continued in the status of deserter after 1930, yet produced evidence relating to the period from that time on.  It assumes he was insane during the eight years, yet succeeded during that long time in absenting himself from persons who could testify in his favor.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf.</em> <a href="#F12" name="T12">note 12</a> <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Compare Bishop v.

If he takes the gamble and loses, he pays with his own case, regardless of its merit and without opportunity for the jury to consider it.  To force this choice and yet deny that afforded by the directed verdict would be to imbed in the Constitution the hypertechnicality of common law pleading and procedure in their heyday.  <em>Cf.</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">note 22</a> <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Under that practice, the moving party receives the benefit of jury evaluation of his own case and of challenge to his opponent\'s for insufficiency.

It is, rather, for the reasons that the court finds the opposite party\'s evidence is legally sufficient, and the jury has found it outweighs his own.  There is thus no forced surrender of one right from assertion of another.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if the challenger wins, there is another trial.

JUSTICE MURPHY concur, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides:</p>\n<p>"In suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no fact tried by a jury shall </p><p><a class="page-number" name="397">Page 319 U. S. 397</a></p><p> be otherwise reexamined in any Court of the United States, than according to the rules of the common law."</p>\n<p>The Court here reexamines testimony offered in a common law suit, weighs conflicting evidence, and holds that the litigant may never take this case to a jury.  The founders of our government thought that trial of fact by juries, rather than by judges, was an essential bulwark of civil liberty. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  For this reason, among others, they adopted Article III, \xc2\xa7 2 of the Constitution, and the Sixth and Seventh Amendments.  Today\'s decision marks a continuation of the gradual process of judicial erosion which, in one hundred fifty years, has slowly worn away a major portion of the essential guarantee of the Seventh Amendment.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Alexander Hamilton, in The Federalist, emphasized his loyalty to the jury system in civil cases and declared that jury verdicts should be reexamined, if at all, only</p>\n<p>"by a second jury, either by remanding the cause to the court below for a second trial of the fact or by directing an issue immediately out of the Supreme Court."</p>\n<p>He divided the citizens of his time between those who thought that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="398">Page 319 U. S. 398</a></p><p> jury trial was a "valuable safeguard to liberty" and those who thought it was "the very palladium of free government."  However, he felt it unnecessary to include in the Constitution a specific provision placing jury trial in civil cases in the same high position as jury trial in criminal cases. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Hamilton\'s view, that constitutional protection of jury trial in civil cases was undesirable, did not prevail.  On the contrary, in response to widespread demands from the various State Constitutional Conventions, the first Congress adopted the Bill of Rights containing the Sixth and Seventh Amendments, intended to save trial in both criminal and common law cases from legislative or judicial abridgment. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  The first Congress expected the Seventh Amendment to meet the objections of men like Patrick Henry to the Constitution itself.  Henry, speaking in the Virginia Constitutional Convention, had expressed the general conviction of the people of the Thirteen States when he said,</p>\n<p>"Trial by jury is the best appendage of freedom. . . .  We are told that we are to part with that trial by jury with which our ancestors secured their lives and property. . . .  I hope we shall never be induced by such arguments to part with that excellent mode of trial.  No appeal can now be made as to fact in common law suits.  <em>The unanimous verdict of impartial men cannot be reversed.</em> [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]"</p>\n<p>The first Congress therefore </p><p><a class="page-number" name="399">Page 319 U. S. 399</a></p><p> provided for trial of common law cases by a jury, even when such trials were in the Supreme Court itself.  1 Stat. 73, 81.</p>\n<p>In 1789, juries occupied the principal place in the administration of justice.  They were frequently, in both criminal [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] and civil cases, the arbiters not only of fact, but of law.  Less than three years after the ratification of the Seventh Amendment, this Court called a jury in a civil case brought under our original jurisdiction.  There was no disagreement as to the facts of the case.  Chief Justice Jay, charging the jury for a unanimous Court, three of whose members had sat in the Constitutional Convention, said:</p>\n<p>"For as, on the one hand, it is presumed, that juries are the best judges of facts, it is, on the other hand, presumable that the court[s] are the best judges of law.  But still, both objects are lawfully within your power of decision."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/1/case.html">Georgia v. Brailsford,</a></span></em> 3 Dall. 1,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/1/case.html#4">3 U. S. 4</a></span>.  Similar views were held by state courts in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Illinois, Louisiana and presumably elsewhere. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The principal method by which judges prevented cases from going to the jury in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries was by the demurrer to the evidence, under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="400">Page 319 U. S. 400</a></p><p> which the defendant, at the end of the trial, admitted all facts shown by the plaintiff as well as all inferences which might be drawn from the facts, and asked for a ruling of the Court on the "law of the case." [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  <em>See, for example, Wright v. Pindar,</em> (1647) Alleyn 18, and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/8/219/case.html">Pawling v. United States,</a></span></em> 4 Cranch 219.  This practice fell into disuse in England in 1793, <em>Gibson v.

The power of federal judges to comment to the jury on the evidence gave them additional influence.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/26/170/case.html">M\'Lanahan v.

[<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  In 1830, this Court said:</p>\n<p>"The only modes known to the common law to reexamine such facts are the granting of a new trial by the court where the issue was tried, or to which the record was properly returnable, or the award of a <em>venire facias de novo,</em> by an appellate court, for some error of law which intervened in the proceedings."</p>\n<p><em>Parsons v.

[<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  That retrial by a new jury, rather than factual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="401">Page 319 U.

New York Life Insurance Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/228/364/case.html">228 U. S. 364</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>A long step toward the determination of fact by judges, instead of by juries, was the invention of the directed verdict. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  In 1850, what seems to have been the first directed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="402">Page 319 U. S. 402</a></p><p> verdict case considered by this Court, <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/52/362/case.html">Parks v. Ross,</a></span></em> 11 How. 362,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/52/362/case.html#374">52 U. S. 374</a></span>, was presented for decision.  The Court held that the directed verdict serves the same purpose as the demurrer to the evidence, and that, since there was "no evidence whatever" [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>] on the critical issue in the case, the directed verdict was approved. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  The decision was an innovation, a departure from the traditional rule restated only fifteen years before in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/292/case.html">Greenleaf v. Birth,</a></span></em> 9 Pet. 292,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/34/292/case.html#299">34 U. S. 299</a></span>, in which this Court had said:</p>\n<p>"Where there is no evidence tending to prove a particular fact, the court[s] are bound so to instruct the jury, when requested, but they cannot legally give any instruction which shall take from the jury the right of weighing the evidence and determining what effect it shall have."</p>\n<p>This new device contained potentialities for judicial control of the jury which had not existed in the demurrer to the evidence.  In the first place, demurring to the evidence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="403">Page 319 U. S. 403</a></p><p> was risky business, for, in so doing, the party not only admitted the truth of all the testimony against him, but also all reasonable inferences which might be drawn from it, and, upon joinder in demurrer, the case was withdrawn from the jury while the court proceeded to give final judgment either for or against the demurrant.  <em>Hopkins v. Railroad,</em> 96 Tenn. 409, 34 S.W. 1029; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/427/case.html">Suydam v. Williamson,</a></span></em> 20 How. 427,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/427/case.html#436">61 U. S. 436</a></span>; <em>Bass v. Rublee,</em> 76 Vt. 395, 400, 57 A. 965.  Imposition of this risk was no mere technicality, for, by making withdrawal of a case from the jury dangerous to the moving litigant\'s cause, the early law went far to assure that facts would never be examined except by a jury.  Under the directed verdict practice, the moving party takes no such chance, for if his motion is denied, instead of suffering a directed verdict against him, his case merely continues into the hands of the jury.  The litigant not only takes no risk by a motion for a directed verdict, but, in making such a motion, gives himself two opportunities to avoid the jury\'s decision; for, under the federal variant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the judge may reserve opinion on the motion for a directed verdict and then give judgment for the moving party after the jury was formally found against him. [<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  In the second place, under the directed verdict practice, the courts soon abandoned the "admission of all facts and reasonable inferences" standard referred to, and created the so-called "substantial evidence" rule, which permitted directed verdicts even though there was far more evidence in the case than a plaintiff would have needed to withstand a demurrer.</p>\n<p>The substantial evidence rule did not spring into existence immediately upon the adoption of the directed verdict device.  For a few more years, [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>] federal judges </p><p><a class="page-number" name="404">Page 319 U. S. 404</a></p><p> held to the traditional rule that juries might pass finally on facts if there was "any evidence" to support a party\'s contention.  The rule that a case must go to the jury unless there was "no evidence" was completely repudiated in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/81/442/case.html">Improvement Co. v. Munson,</a></span></em> 14 Wall. 442,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/81/442/case.html#447">81 U. S. 447</a></span>-448, upon which the Court today relies in part.  There, the Court declared that "some" evidence was not enough -- there must be evidence sufficiently persuasive to the judge so that he thinks "a jury can properly proceed."  The traditional rule was given an ugly name, "the scintilla rule," to hasten its demise.  For a time, traces of the old formula remained, as in <em>Randall v. B. &amp; O. R. Co,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/109/478/case.html">109 U. S. 478</a></span>, but the new spirit prevailed.  <em>See, for example, Pleasants v. Fant, supra,</em> and <em>Commissioners v. Clark,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/278/case.html">94 U. S. 278</a></span>.  The same transition from jury supremacy to jury subordination through judicial decisions took place in State courts. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p>Later cases permitted the development of added judicial control. [<a href="#F2/17" name="T2/17">Footnote 2/17</a>]  New and totally unwarranted formulas, which should surely be eradicated from the law at the first opportunity, were added as recently as 1929 in <em>Gunning v. Cooley,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/90/case.html">281 U. S. 90</a></span>, which, by sheerest dictum, made new encroachments on the jury\'s constitutional functions.  There, it was announced that a judge might weigh the evidence to determine whether he, and not the jury, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 319 U. S. 405</a></p><p> thought it was "overwhelming" for either party, and then direct a verdict.  <em>Cf. Pence v.

S. 332</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/332/case.html#340">316 U. S. 340</a></span>; <em>Gunning v. Cooley,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/281/90/case.html#94">281 U. S. 94</a></span>, also suggests, quite unnecessarily for its decision, that,</p>\n<p>"When a plaintiff produces evidence that is consistent with an hypothesis that the defendant is not negligent, and also with one that he is, his proof tends to establish neither."</p>\n<p>This dictum, which assumes that a judge can weigh conflicting evidence with mathematical precision and which wholly deprives the jury of the right to resolve that conflict, was applied in <em>Pennsylvania R. Co. v. Chamberlain,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/333/case.html">288 U. S. 333</a></span>.  With it and other tools, jury verdicts on disputed facts have been set aside or directed verdicts authorized so regularly as to make the practice commonplace, while the motion for directed verdict itself has become routine.  <em>See, for example, Southern Railway Co. v. Walters,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/190/case.html">284 U. S. 190</a></span>; <em>Atlantic Coast Line v.

S. 94</a></span>, acknowledged that "issues that depend on the credibility of witnesses . . . are to be decided by the jury." [<a href="#F2/18" name="T2/18">Footnote 2/18</a>]  Today, the Court comes dangerously close to weighing the credibility of a witness and rejecting his testimony because the majority do not believe it.</p>\n<p>The story thus briefly told depicts the constriction of a constitutional civil right and should not be continued.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="406">Page 319 U. S. 406</a></p><p> Speaking of an aspect of this problem, a contemporary writer saw the heart of the issue:</p>\n<p>"Such a reversal of opinion [as that of a particular State court concerning the jury function], if it were isolated, might have little significance, but when many other courts throughout the country are found to be making the same shift, and to be doing so despite the provisions of statutes and constitutions, there is revealed one aspect of that basic conflict in the legal history of America -- the conflict between the people\'s aspiration for democratic government [<a href="#F2/19" name="T2/19">Footnote 2/19</a>] and the judiciary\'s desire for the orderly supervision of public affairs by judges. [<a href="#F2/20" name="T2/20">Footnote 2/20</a>]"</p>\n<p>The language of the Seventh Amendment cannot easily be improved by formulas. [<a href="#F2/21" name="T2/21">Footnote 2/21</a>]  The statement of a district judge in <em>Tarter v. United States,</em> 17 F.Supp. 691, 692, 693, represents, in my opinion, the minimum meaning of the Seventh Amendment:</p>\n<p>"The Seventh Amendment to the Constitution guarantees a jury trial in law cases, where there is substantial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="407">Page 319 U. S. 407</a></p><p> evidence to support the claim of the plaintiff in an action.  If a single witness testifies to a fact sustaining the issue between the parties, or if reasoning minds might reach different conclusions from the testimony of a single witness, one of which would substantially support the issue of the contending party, the issue must be left to the jury.  Trial by jury is a fundamental guaranty of the rights of the people, and judges should not search the evidence with meticulous care to deprive litigants of jury trials."</p>\n<p>The call for the true application of the Seventh Amendment is not to words, but to the spirit of honest desire to see that Constitutional right preserved.  Either the judge or the jury must decide facts, and, to the extent that we take this responsibility, we lessen the jury function.  Our duty to preserve this one of the Bill of Rights may be peculiarly difficult, for here it is our own power which we must restrain.  We should not fail to meet the expectation of James Madison, who, in advocating the adoption of the Bill of Rights, said:</p>\n<p>"Independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights; . . . they will be naturally led to resist every encroachment upon rights expressly stipulated for in the Constitution by the declaration of right."</p>\n<p>So few of these cases come to this Court that, as a matter of fact, the judges of the District Courts and the Circuit Courts of Appeal are the primary custodians of the Amendment.  As for myself, I believe that a verdict should be directed, if at all, only when, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses, there is in the evidence no room whatever for honest difference of opinion over the factual issue in controversy.  I shall continue to believe that, in all other cases, a judge should, in obedience to the command of the Seventh Amendment, not interfere with the jury\'s function.  Since this is a matter of high constitutional importance, appellate courts should be alert to insure the preservation of this constitutional right even though each case necessarily turns on its peculiar circumstances. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="408">Page 319 U. S. 408</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The factual issue for determination here is whether the petitioner incurred a total and permanent disability not later than May 31, 1919.  It is undisputed that the petitioner\'s health was sound in 1918, and it is evidently conceded that he was disabled at least since 1930.  When, in the intervening period, did the disability take place?</p>\n<p>A doctor who testified diagnosed the petitioner\'s case as a schizophrenic form of dementia praecox.  He declared it to be sound medical theory that, while a normal man can retain his sanity in the face of severe mental or physical shock, some persons are born with an inherent instability, so that they are mentally unable to stand sudden and severe strain.  The medical testimony was that this petitioner belongs to the latter class, and that the shock of actual conflict on the battlefront brought on the incurable affliction from which he now suffers.  The medical witness testified that the dominant symptoms of the condition are extreme introversion and preoccupation with personal interests, a persecution complex, and an emotional instability which may be manifested by extreme exhilaration alternating with unusual depression or irrational outbursts.  Persons suffering from this disease are therefore unable to engage in continuous employment.</p>\n<p>The petitioner relies on the testimony of wartime and postwar companions and superiors to show that his present mental condition existed on the crucial date.  There is substantial testimony from which reasonable men might conclude that the petitioner was insane from the date claimed.</p>\n<p>Two witnesses testify as to the petitioner\'s mental irresponsibility while he was in France.  The most striking incident in this testimony is the account of his complete breakdown while on guard duty as a result of which he falsely alarmed his military unit by screaming that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="409">Page 319 U. S. 409</a></p><p> Germans were coming when they were not, and was silenced only by being forceably bound and gagged.  There was also other evidence that Galloway became nervous, irritable, quarrelsome, and turbulent after he got to France.  The Court disposes of this testimony, which obviously indicates some degree of mental unbalance, by saying no more than that it "does not prove he was insane."  No reason is given, nor can I imagine any, why a jury should not be entitled to consider this evidence and draw its own conclusions.</p>\n<p>The testimony of another witness, O\'Neill, was offered to show that the witness had known the petitioner both before and after the war, and that, after the war, the witness found the petitioner a changed man; that the petitioner imagined that he was being persecuted, and that the petitioner suffered from fits of melancholia, depression, and weeping.  If O\'Neill\'s testimony is to be believed, the petitioner suffered the typical symptoms of a schizophreniac for some years after his return to this country; therefore, if O\'Neill\'s testimony is believed, there can be no reasonable doubt about the right of a jury to pass on this case.  The Court analyzes O\'Neill\'s testimony for internal consistency, criticizes his failure to remember the details of his association with the petitioner fifteen years before his appearance in this case, and concludes that O\'Neill\'s evidence shows no more than that "petitioner was subject to alternating periods of gaiety and depression for some indefinite period."  This extreme emotional instability is an accepted symptom of the disease from which the petitioner suffers.  If he exhibited the same symptoms in 1922, it is, at the minimum, probable that the condition has been continuous since an origin during the war.  O\'Neill\'s testimony, coupled with the petitioner\'s present condition, presents precisely the type of question which a jury should resolve. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="410">Page 319 U. S. 410</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The petitioner was in the Navy for six months in 1920, until he was discharged for bad conduct, and later was in the Army during 1921 and a part of 1922 until he deserted.  The testimony of his Commanding Officer while he was in the Army, Col. Matthews, is that the petitioner had "periods of gaiety and exhilaration," and was then "depressed as if he had had a hangover;" that petitioner tried to create disturbances and dissatisfy the men; that he suffered from a belief that he was being treated unfairly, and that generally his actions "were not those of a normal man."  The Colonel was not a doctor, and might well not have recognized insanity had he seen it; as it was, he concluded that the petitioner was an alcoholic and a narcotic addict.  However, the officer was unable, upon repeated investigations, to discover any actual use of narcotics.  A jury fitting this information into the general pattern of the testimony might well have been driven to the conclusion that the petitioner was insane at the time the Colonel had him under observation.</p>\n<p>All of this evidence, if believed, showed a man, healthy and normal before he went to the war, suffering for several years after he came back from a disease which had the symptoms attributed to schizophrenia, and who was insane from 1930 until his trial.  Under these circumstances, I think that the physician\'s testimony of total and permanent disability by reason of continuous insanity from 1918 to 1938 was reasonable.  The fact that there was no direct testimony for a period of five years, while it might be the basis of fair argument to the jury by the government, does not, as the Court seems to believe, create a presumption against the petitioner so strong that his case must be excluded from the jury entirely.  Even if, during these five years, the petitioner was spasmodically employed, we could not conclude that he was not totally and permanently disabled.  <em>Berry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/450/case.html">312 U. S. 450</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/450/case.html#455">312 U. S. 455</a></span>.  It is not doubted that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="411">Page 319 U. S. 411</a></p><p> schizophrenia is permanent even though there may be a momentary appearance of recovery.</p>\n<p>The court below concluded that the petitioner\'s admission into the military service between 1920 and 1923 showed conclusively that he was not totally and permanently disabled.  Any inference which may be created by the petitioner\'s admission into the Army and the Navy is more than met by his record of court-martial, dishonorable discharge, and desertion, as well as by the explicit testimony of his Commanding Officer, Colonel Matthews.</p>\n<p>This case graphically illustrates the injustice resulting from permitting judges to direct verdicts instead of requiring them to await a jury decision and then, if necessary, allow a new trial.  The chief reason given for approving a directed verdict against this petitioner is that no evidence except expert medical testimony was offered for a five- to eight-year period.  Perhaps, now that the petitioner knows he has insufficient evidence to satisfy a judge even though he may have enough to satisfy a jury, he would be able to fill this time gap to meet any judge\'s demand.  If a court would point out on a motion for new trial that the evidence as to this particular period was too weak, the petitioner would be given an opportunity to buttress the physician\'s evidence.  If, as the Court believes, insufficient evidence has been offered to sustain a jury verdict for the petitioner, we should at least authorize a new trial.  <em>Cf. Garrison v. United States,</em> 62 F.2d 41, 42.</p>\n<p>I believe that there is a reasonable difference of opinion as to whether the petitioner was totally and permanently disabled by reason of insanity on May 31, 1919, and that his case therefore should have been allowed to go to the jury.  The testimony of fellow soldiers, friends, supervisors, and of a medical expert whose integrity and ability is not challenged cannot be rejected by any process available to me as a judge.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"I consider trial by jury as the only anchor ever yet imagined by man by which a government can be held to the principles of its constitution."  3 Writings of Thomas Jefferson (Washington ed.) 71.</p>\n<p>The operation of the jury trial system in civil cases has been subject to careful analysis:  Clark and Shulman, Jury Trial in Civil Cases, 43 Yale L.Jour. 867; Harris, Is the Jury Vanishing, 7 N.Y.U.L.Q. 657.

A reasonable doubt, barely, that justice has not been done, especially in cases where the value or importance of the cause is not great, appears to me to be too slender a ground for them.  But whenever it appears with a reasonable certainty that actual and manifest injustice is done, or that the jury have proceeded on an evident mistake, either in point of law or fact, or contrary to strong evidence, or have grossly misbehaved themselves, or given extravagant damages, the court will always give an opportunity, by a new trial, of rectifying the mistakes of the former jury, and of doing complete justice to the parties."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/2/55/case.html">Cowperthwaite v.
