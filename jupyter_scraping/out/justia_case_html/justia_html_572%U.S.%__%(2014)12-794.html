Kentucky,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288\n, is not required at the penalty phase.  Subsequently, the Federal District Court granted respondent habeas relief, holding that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to give the requested instruction violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s privilege against self-incrimination.

Mitchell in particular leaves open the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase silence.  Thus, it cannot be read to require the type of blanket no-adverse-inference instruction requested and denied here.  Moreover, because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s own admissions of guilt had established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the burden of proof, Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s narrow holding, which implied that it was limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime, does not apply.

After pleading guilty to murder, rape, and kidnaping, he was sentenced to death.  The Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed the sentence, and we denied certiorari.  Ten years later, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of habeas corpus on his\n \nFifth Amendment claim.  In so doing, it disregarded the limitations of\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x94a provision of law that some federal judges find too confining, but that all federal judges must obey.

When she failed to return home several hours later, her family called the police.  Officers eventually found the vehicle Hansen had been driving a short distance from the convenience store.  They followed a 400- to 500-foot trail of blood from the van to a nearby lake, where Hansen\xe2\x80\x99s unclothed, dead body was found floating in the water.  Hansen\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthroat had been slashed twice with each cut approximately 3.5 to 4 inches long,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[h]er windpipe was totally severed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Woodall v.

Respondent gave conflicting statements regarding his whereabouts that evening.  Further investigation revealed that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfingerprints were on the van the victim was driving,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[b]lood was found on [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] front door,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[b]lood on his clothing and sweatshirt was consistent with the blood of the victim,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cDNA on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. vaginal swabs\xe2\x80\x9d taken from the victim \xe2\x80\x9cwas consistent with\xe2\x80\x9d respondent\xe2\x80\x99s.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Faced with overwhelming evidence of his guilt, respondent pleaded guilty to capital murder.  He also pleaded guilty to capital kidnaping and first-degree rape, the statutory aggravating circumstance for the murder.  See App. 78; Ky. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7532.025(2)(a) (West Supp. 2012).  At the ensuing penalty-phase trial, respondent called character witnesses but declined to testify himself.  Defense counsel asked the trial judge to instruct the jury that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 31.  The trial judge denied the request, and the Kentucky Supreme Court affirmed that denial.  Woodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115.  While recog-nizing that the\n \nFifth Amendment requires a no-adverse-inference instruction to protect a nontestifying defendant at the guilt phase, see Carter v. Kentucky,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288 (1981)\n, the court held that Carter and our subsequent cases did not require such an instruction here.  Woodall v. Commonwealth, supra, at 115.  We denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari from that direct appeal.  Woodall v.

The District Court granted relief, holding, as relevant here, that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to issue a no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase violated respondent\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.

Smith,\n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 454 (1981)\n, and Mitchell v. United States,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 314 (1999)\n.  Carter held that a no-adverse-inference instruction is required at the guilt phase.  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 294\xe2\x80\x93295, 300.  Estelle concerned the introduction at the penalty phase of the results of an involuntary, un-Mirandized pretrial psychiatric examination.  451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456\xe2\x80\x93457, and n.\xc2\xa01; id., at 461.  And Mitchell disapproved a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of an adverse inference from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence at sentencing \xe2\x80\x9cwith regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 327\xe2\x80\x93330.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is clear that the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d the actual holding of any of these cases.\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals held, however, that the \xe2\x80\x9cKentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of this constitutional claim was an unreasonable application of\xe2\x80\x9d those cases.  685 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 579.  In its view, \xe2\x80\x9creading Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell together, the only reasonable conclusion is that\xe2\x80\x9d a no-adverse-inference instruction was required at the penalty phase.  Ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We need not decide here, and express no view on, whether the conclusion that a no-adverse-inference instruction was required would be correct in a case not reviewed through the lens of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  For we are satisfied that the issue was, at a minimum, not \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond any possibility for fairminded disagreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harrington, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We have, it is true, held that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to the penalty phase.  See Estelle, supra, at 463; Mitchell, supra, at 328\xe2\x80\x93329.  But it is not uncommon for a constitutional rule to apply somewhat differently at the penalty phase than it does at the guilt phase.  See, e.g., Bobby v. Mitts, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 4).  We have \xe2\x80\x9cnever directly held that Carter applies at a sentencing phase where the\n \nFifth Amendment interests of the defendant are different.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Whitten, 623 F.\xc2\xa03d 125, 131\xe2\x80\x93132, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA2 2010) (Livingston, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Indeed, Mitchell itself leaves open the possibility that some inferences might permissibly be drawn from a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase silence.  In that case, the District Judge had actually drawn from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence an adverse inference about the drug quantity attributable to the defendant.  See 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 317\xe2\x80\x93319.  We held that this ran afoul of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright to remain silent at sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 325, 327\xe2\x80\x93328 (citing Griffin v. California,\n\n380 U.\xc2\xa0S. 609,\n614 (1965)\n).  But we framed our holding narrowly, in terms implying that it was limited to inferences pertaining to the facts of the crime: \xe2\x80\x9cWe decline to adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a crimi-nal case with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mitchell, 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 328 (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Government retains,\xe2\x80\x9d we said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe burden of proving facts relevant to the crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and cannot enlist the defendant in this process at the expense of the self-incrimination privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 330 (emphasis added).  And Mitchell included an express reservation of direct relevance here: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in \xc2\xa73E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question.  It is not before us, and we express no view on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s reservation is relevant here for two reasons.  First, if Mitchell suggests that some actual inferences might be permissible at the penalty phase, it certainly cannot be read to require a blanket no-adverse-inference instruction at every penalty-phase trial.  And it was a blanket instruction that was requested and denied in this case; respondent\xe2\x80\x99s requested instruction would have informed the jury that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] defendant is not compelled to testify and the fact that the defendant did not testify should not prejudice him in any way.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 31 (emphasis added).  Counsel for respondent conceded at oral argument that remorse was at issue during the penalty-phase trial, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 39; see also Brief for Respondent 18, yet the proposed instruction would have precluded the jury from considering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s silence as indicative of his lack of remorse.  Indeed, the trial judge declined to give the no-adverse-inference instruction precisely because he was \xe2\x80\x9caware of no case law that precludes the jury from considering the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lack of expression of remorse .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 36.  This alone suffices to establish that the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion was not \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Andrade, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 76.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, regardless of the scope of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proposed instruction, any inferences that could have been drawn from respondent\xe2\x80\x99s silence would arguably fall within the class of inferences as to which Mitchell leaves the door open.  Respondent pleaded guilty to all of the charges he faced, including the applicable aggravating circumstances.  Thus, Kentucky could not have shifted to respondent its \xe2\x80\x9cburden of proving facts relevant to the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d 526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 330: Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s own admissions had already established every relevant fact on which Kentucky bore the burden of proof.  There are reasonable arguments that the logic of Mitchell does not apply to such cases.  See, e.g., United States v. Ronquillo, 508 F.\xc2\xa03d 744, 749 (CA5 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cMitchell is inapplicable to the sentencing decision in this case because \xe2\x80\x98the facts of the offense\xe2\x80\x99 were based entirely on Ronquillo\xe2\x80\x99s admissions, not on any adverse inference .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  Ronquillo, unlike the defendant in Mitchell, admitted all the predicate facts of his offenses\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The dissent insists that Mitchell is irrelevant because it merely declined to create an exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule,\xe2\x80\x9d supposedly established by Estelle, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction\xe2\x80\x9d at sentencing.  Post, at 5 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  That argument disregards perfectly reasonable interpretations of Estelle and Mitchell and hence contravenes \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review.  Estelle did not involve an adverse inference based on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence or a corresponding jury instruction.  See 451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 461\xe2\x80\x93469.  Thus, whatever Estelle said about the\n \nFifth Amendment, its holding[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]\xe2\x80\x94the only aspect of the decision relevant here\xe2\x80\x94does not \xe2\x80\x9crequir[e]\xe2\x80\x9d the categorical rule the dissent ascribes to it.  Carey v. Musladin,\n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 70,\n76 (2006)\n.  Likewise, fairminded jurists could conclude that Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s reservation regarding remorse and acceptance of responsibility would have served no meaningful purpose if Estelle had created an across-the-board rule against adverse inferences; we are, after all, hardly in the habit of reserving \xe2\x80\x9cseparate question[s],\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchell, supra, at 330, that have already been definitively answered.  In these circumstances, where the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98precise contours\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the right remain \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unclear,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d state courts enjoy \xe2\x80\x9cbroad discretion\xe2\x80\x9d in their adjudication of a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claims.

See 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 407\xe2\x80\x93409 (citing Green v. French, 143 F.\xc2\xa03d 865, 869\xe2\x80\x93870 (1998)).  We described the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d clause as \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally correct,\xe2\x80\x9d 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 407, and approved its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9ca state-court decision involves an unreasonable application of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent if the state court identifies the correct governing legal rule .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. but unreasonably applies it to the facts of the particular state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 407\xe2\x80\x93408 (citing Green, supra, at 869\xe2\x80\x93870).  But we took no position on the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s further conclusion that a state court commits AEDPA error if it \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonably refuse[s] to extend a legal principle to a new context where it should apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 408\xe2\x80\x93409 (citing Green, supra, at 869\xe2\x80\x93870).  We chose not \xe2\x80\x9cto decide how such \xe2\x80\x98extension of legal principle\xe2\x80\x99 cases should be treated under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x9d because the Fourth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule for resolving them presented several \xe2\x80\x9cproblems of precision.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 408\xe2\x80\x93409.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Two months later, a plurality paraphrased and applied the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in Ramdass. See 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 166\xe2\x80\x93170.  It did not, however, grant the habeas petitioner relief on that basis, finding that there was no unreasonable refusal to extend.  Moreover, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, whose vote was necessary to form a majority, cited Williams and made no mention of the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend concept in her separate opinion concurring in the judgment.  See 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178\xe2\x80\x93181.  Ramdass therefore did not alter the interpretation of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) set forth in Williams.  Aside from one opinion criticizing the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend doctrine, see Yarborough v. Alvarado,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 652,\n666 (2004)\n, we have not revisited the issue since Williams and Ramdass.  During that same 14-year stretch, however, we have repeatedly restated our \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d in Williams, supra, at 409, that a state-court decision is an unreasonable application of our clearly established precedent if it correctly identifies the governing legal rule but applies that rule unreasonably to the facts of a particular prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s case, see, e.g., Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 10); Rompilla v. Beard,\n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 374,\n380 (2005)\n; Yarborough, supra, at 663; Penry v. Johnson,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 782,\n792 (2001)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Thus, this Court has never adopted the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule on which respondent relies.  It has not been so much as endorsed in a majority opinion, let alone relied on as a basis for granting habeas relief.  To the extent the unreasonable-refusal-to-extend rule differs from the one embraced in Williams and reiterated many times since, we reject it.  Section 2254(d)(1) provides a remedy for instances in which a state court unreasonably applies this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent; it does not require state courts to extend that precedent or license federal courtsto treat the failure to do so as error.  See Scheidegger, Ha-beas Corpus, Relitigation, and the Legislative Power, 98 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 888, 949 (1998).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cif a habeas court must extend a rationale before it can apply to the facts at hand,\xe2\x80\x9d then by definition the rationale was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established at the time of the state-court decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yarborough, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 666.  AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s carefully constructed framework \xe2\x80\x9cwould be undermined if habeas courts introduced rules not clearly established under the guise of extensions to existing law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This is not to say that \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) requires an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98identical factual pattern before a legal rule must be applied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Panetti v. Quarterman,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 930,\n953 (2007)\n.  To the contrary, state courts must reasonably apply the rules \xe2\x80\x9csquarely established\xe2\x80\x9d by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holdings to the facts of each case.  Knowles v. Mirzayance,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 111,\n122 (2009)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he difference between applying a rule and extending it is not always clear,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ertain principles are fundamental enough that when new factual permu-tations arise, the necessity to apply the earlier rule willbe beyond doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Yarborough, supra, at 666.  The crit-ical point is that relief is available under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s unreasonable-application clause if, and only if, it is so obvious that a clearly established rule applies to a given set of facts that there could be no \xe2\x80\x9cfairminded disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d on the question, Harrington, 562 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Perhaps the logical next step from Carter, Estelle, and Mitchell would be to hold that the\n \nFifth Amendment requires a penalty-phase no-adverse-inference instruction in a case like this one; perhaps not.  Either way, we have not yet taken that step, and there are reasonable arguments on both sides\xe2\x80\x94which is all Kentucky needs to prevail in this AEDPA case.  The appropriate time to consider the question as a matter of first impression would be on direct review, not in a habeas case governed by \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because the Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFifth Amendment claim was not objectively unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit erred in granting the writ.  We therefore need not reach its further holding that the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s putative error was not harmless.

In my view, the answer is yes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in Carter v. Kentucky,\n\n450 U. S. 288 (1981)\n, and Estelle v. Smith,\n\n451 U. S. 454 (1981)\n, clearly establish that a criminal defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction in the penalty phase of a capital trial.  First consider Carter.  The Court held that a trial judge \xe2\x80\x9chas the constitutional obligation, upon proper request,\xe2\x80\x9d to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction in order \xe2\x80\x9cto minimize the danger that the jury will give evidentiary weight to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to testify.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 305.  This is because when \xe2\x80\x9cthe jury is left to roam at large with only its untutored instincts to guide it,\xe2\x80\x9d it may \xe2\x80\x9cdraw from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence broad inferences of guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 301.  A trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction thus \xe2\x80\x9cexacts an impermissible toll on the full and free exercise of the [\n \nFifth Amendment] privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 305.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Now consider Estelle.  The Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cso far as the protection of the\n \nFifth Amendment privilege is concerned,\xe2\x80\x9d it could \xe2\x80\x9cdiscern no basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases\xe2\x80\x9d of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccapital murder trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93463.  The State had introduced at the penalty phase the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s compelled statements to a psychiatrist, in order to show the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness.  Defending the admission of those statements, the State argued that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas not entitled to the protection of the\n \nFifth Amendment because [his statements were] used only to determine punishment after conviction, not to establish guilt.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 462.  This Court rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument on the ground that the\n \nFifth Amendment applies equally to the penalty phase and the guilt phase of a capital trial.  Id., at 462\xe2\x80\x93463.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        What is unclear about the resulting law?  If the Court holds in Case A that the\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits Congress from discriminating based on viewpoint, and then holds in Case B that the\n \nFourteenth Amendment incorporates the\n \nFirst Amendment as to the States, then it is clear that the\n \nFirst Amendment prohibits the States from discriminating based on viewpoint.  By the same logic, because the Court held in Carter that the\n \nFifth Amendment requires a trial judge to give a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the guilt phase of a trial, and held in Estelle that there is no basis for distinguishing between the guilt and punishment phases of a capital trial for purposes of the\n \nFifth Amendment, it is clear that the\n \nFifth Amendment requires a judge to provide a requested no-adverse-inference instruction during the penalty phase of a capital trial.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court avoids this logic by reading Estelle too narrowly.  First, it contends that Estelle\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the\n \nFifth Amendment applies equally to the guilt and penalty phases was mere dictum.  Ante, at 8, and n.\xc2\xa04.  But this rule was essential to the resolution of the case, so it is binding precedent, not dictum.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, apparently in the alternative, the majority acknowledges that Estelle \xe2\x80\x9cheld that the privilege against self-incrimination applies to the penalty phase,\xe2\x80\x9d but it concludes that Estelle said nothing about the content ofthe privilege in the penalty phase.  Ante, at 5 (emphasis added).  This interpretation of Estelle ignores its rationale.  The reason that Estelle concluded that the\n \nFifth Amendment applies to the penalty phase of a capital trial is that the Court saw \xe2\x80\x9cno basis to distinguish between the guilt and penalty phases of [a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] capital murder trial so far as the protection of the\n \nFifth Amendment privilege is concerned.\xe2\x80\x9d  451 U. S., at 462\xe2\x80\x93463.  And as there is no basis to distinguish between the two contexts for\n \nFifth Amendment purposes, there is no basis for varying either the application or the content of the\n \nFifth Amendment privilege in the two contexts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority also reads our decision in Mitchell v. United States,\n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 314 (1999)\n, to change the legal land-scape where it expressly declined to do so.  In Mitchell, the Court considered whether to create an exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule in a criminal case . . . that no negative inference from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to testify is permitted.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 328.  We refused: \xe2\x80\x9cWe decline to adopt an exception for the sentencing phase of a criminal case with regard to factual determinations respecting the circumstances and details of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Mitchell thus reiterated what Carter and Estelle had already established.  The \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule\xe2\x80\x9d is that\n \nFifth Amendment protections apply during trial and sentencing.  Because the Court refused \xe2\x80\x9cto adopt an exception\xe2\x80\x9d to this default rule, ibid. (emphasis added), the law before and after Mitchell remained the same.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority seizes upon the limited nature of Mitchell\xe2\x80\x99s holding, concluding that by refusing to adopt an exception to the normal rule for certain \xe2\x80\x9cfactual determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d Mitchell suggested that inferences about other matters might be permissible at the penalty phase.  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.  The majority seems to believe that Mitchell somehow casts doubt upon whether Estelle\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nFifth Amendment rule applies to matters unrelated to the \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances and details of the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d such as remorse, or as to which the State does not bear the burden of proof.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As an initial matter, Mitchell would have had to overrule\xe2\x80\x94or at least substantially limit\xe2\x80\x94Estelle to create an exception for matters unrelated to the circumstances and details of the crime or for matters on which the defendant bears the burden of proof.  Sentencing proceedings, particularly capital sentencing proceedings, often focus on factual matters that do not directly concern facts of the crime.  Was the defendant subject to flagrant abuse in his growing-up years?  Is he suffering from a severe physical or mental impairment?  Was he supportive of his family?  Is he remorseful?  Estelle itself involved compelled statements introduced to establish the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness\xe2\x80\x94another fact often unrelated to the circumstances or details of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s crime.  451 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 456.  In addition, States typically place the burden to prove mitigating factors at the penalty phase on the defendant.  A reasonable jurist would not believe that Mitchell, by refusing to create an exception to Estelle, intended to undermine the very case it reaffirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Mitchell held, simply and only, that the normal rule of Estelle applied in the circumstances of the particular case before the Court.  That holding does not destabilize settled law beyond its reach.  We frequently resist reaching beyond the facts of a case before us, and we often say so.  That does not mean that we throw cases involving all other factual circumstances into a shadow-land of legal doubt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The majority also places undue weight on dictum in Mitchell reserving judgment as to whether to create additional exceptions to the normal rule of Estelle and Carter.  We noted: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether silence bears upon the determination of a lack of remorse, or upon acceptance of responsibility for purposes of the downward adjustment provided in \xc2\xa73E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Guidelines (1998), is a separate question.  It is not before us, and we express no view on it.\xe2\x80\x9d  526 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 330.  This dictum, says the majority, suggests that some inferences, including about remorse (which was at issue in Woodall\xe2\x80\x99s case), may be permissible.  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        When the Court merely reserves a question that is \xe2\x80\x9cnot before us\xe2\x80\x9d for a future case, we do not cast doubt on legal principles that are already clearly established.  The Court often identifies questions that it is not answering in order to clarify the question it is answering.  In so doing\xe2\x80\x94that is, in \xe2\x80\x9cexpress[ing] no view\xe2\x80\x9d on questions that are not squarely before us\xe2\x80\x94we do not create a state of uncertainty as to those questions.  And in respect to Mitchell, where the Court reserved the question whether to create an exception to the normal rule, this is doubly true.  The normal rule that a defendant is entitled to a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase as well as the guilt phase remained clearly established after Mitchell.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In holding that the Kentucky courts did not unreasonably apply clearly established law, the majority declares that if a court must \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d the rationale of a case in order to apply it, the rationale is not clearly established.  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  I read this to mean simply that if there may be \xe2\x80\x9cfairminded disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d about whether a rationale applies to a certain set of facts, a state court will not unreasonably apply the law by failing to apply that rationale, and I agree.  See Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).  I do not understand the majority to suggest that reading two legal principles together would necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d the law, which would be a proposition entirely inconsistent with our case law.  As long as fairminded jurists would conclude that two (or more) legal rules considered together would dictate a particular outcome, a state court unreasonably applies the law when it holds otherwise.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That is the error the Kentucky Supreme Court committed here.  Failing to consider together the legal principles established by Carter and Estelle, the state court confined those cases to their facts.  It held that Carter did not apply because Woodall had already pleaded guilty\xe2\x80\x94that is, because Woodall requested a no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase rather than the guilt phase of his trial.  Woodall v. Commonwealth, 63 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 104, 115 (Ky. 2001).  And it concluded that Estelle did not apply because Estelle was not a \xe2\x80\x9cjury instruction case.\xe2\x80\x9d  63 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 115.  The Kentucky Supreme Court unreasonably failed to recognize that together Carter and Estelle compel a requested no-adverse-inference instruction at the penalty phase of a capital trial.  And reading Mitchell to rein in the law in contemplation of never-before-recognized exceptions to this normal rule would be an unreasonable retraction of clearly established law, not a proper failure to \xe2\x80\x9cextend\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Because the Sixth Circuit correctly applied clearly established law in granting Woodall\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition, I would affirm.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        With respect I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contraryconclusion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
