Two prosecutions were brought against him based on this single act of possession. The first was a complaint filed January 29, 1970, for violation of 14.32.040 of the Code of the City of Portland which makes it a crime to carry a concealed weapon. The second was an indictment handed up April 20, 1970, for violation of Oregon Revised Statutes 166.270 which makes it a felony for \'any person who has been convicted of a felony against the person or property of another\' to carry a concealed weapon. </p><p> On April 29, 1970, the petitioner was convicted of the ordinance violation. He thereupon entered a plea of double jeopardy to the felony indictment. The plea was sustained in the trial court and the indictment dismissed. The Court of Appeals of Oregon reversed, 92 Oregon Advance Sheets 963 (1971). The Oregon Supreme Court denied review. </p><p> I would grant the petition for certiorari and reverse.
