Petitioner appealed the conviction on the ground that the heroin should have been suppressed as the fruit of an unlawful search.

But the transmission of the information in the form of a Los Angeles \'police report\' is of no immediate analytical significance; the Los Angeles department merely served as a conduit between the searching officer and a still undisclosed source. The fact that the searching officer received his information from another police officer does not alter the usual Fourth Amendment inquiry. On this point the holding of Whiteley v. Warden, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/560/case.html">401 U.S. 560</a> is dispositive; the conclusions embodied in a police bulletin are not shielded from judicial scrutiny. </p><p> The court below viewed petitioner\'s arrival on the designated flight and his physical appearance as corroborative of the \'tip\' received from the Los Angeles police and relied upon Draper v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/307/case.html">358 U.S. 307</a> (1959) in upholding the search. In Draper an informer predicted that the defendant would arrive on a certain train wearing certain clothing and carrying heroin that was recently purchased. The informer, whom the police viewed as reliable from prior dealings, had a few days earlier given information that the defendant was dealing in heroin. The Court held that when the defendant arrived on the designated train attired as the informer had predicted, the police had probable cause to make the search of his person that resulted in the discovery of heroin. Draper does not support the result here; it involved a known informer, having a reputation for reliability, who had given information previously. It is impossible to say that any of these factors were present here. The \'corroboration\' only established that someone was well acquainted with petitioner\'s travel plans. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="945">Page 419 U.S. 942 , 945</a></p><p> As in Whiteley v. Warden, supra, nothing in petitioner\'s appearance when the police first met him tended to confirm the allegation of criminal conduct. </p><p> The decision below arguably represents a failure to follow the Fourth Amendment principles enunciated in our decisions. Accordingly I would grant certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] These requirements were held satisfied in United States v. Harris, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/573/case.html">403 U.S. 573</a> (1971), where the affiant alleged receiving \'personal information\' from a \'prudent person that the defendant had recently sold illicit liquor. However one may view Harris, it plainly furnishes no support for the search here. The Court relied on the fact that the unidenfied informer made admissions against penal interest as well as certain assertions of \'personal knowledge\'-factors necessarily absent here on the present record because the origin of the observations was not explored. </p><p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
