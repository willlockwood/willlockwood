The Appellate Division, First Department, annulled the determination of the Comptroller considering the tax to be a burden upon foreign commerce.  256 App.Div. 207, 9 N.Y.S.2d 544.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the order of the Appellate Division, without opinion. 281 N.Y. 647, 22 N.E.2d 480.  Certiorari was granted, 308 U.S. 545.</p>\n<p>In the absence of an explicit statement by the Court of Appeals that it annulled the assessment of the tax solely because of violation of the federal Constitution, we are unable to find that the decision of the highest court of the State did not rest upon an adequate nonfederal ground.
