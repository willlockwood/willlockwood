As in <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti,</em> these patronage practices are not narrowly tailored to serve vital government interests.  A government\'s interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting, or transferring persons whose work is deficient, and its interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing high-level employees on the basis of their political views.

We hold that they may not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The petition and cross-petition before us arise from a lawsuit protesting certain employment policies and practices instituted by Governor James Thompson of Illinois. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On November 12, 1980, the Governor issued an executive order proclaiming a hiring freeze for every agency, bureau, board, or commission subject to his control.  The order prohibits state officials from hiring any employee, filling any vacancy, creating any new position, or taking any similar action.  It affects approximately 60,000 state positions.  More than 5,000 of these become available each year as a result of resignations, retirements, deaths, expansion, and reorganizations.  The order proclaims that "<em>no</em> exceptions" are permitted without the Governor\'s "express permission after submission of appropriate requests to [his] office."  Governor\'s Executive Order No. 5 (Nov. 12, 1980), Brief for Petitioners 11 (emphasis added). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 497 U. S. 66</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Requests for the Governor\'s "express permission" have allegedly become routine.  Permission has been granted or withheld through an agency expressly created for this purpose, the Governor\'s Office of Personnel (Governor\'s Office).  Agencies have been screening applicants under Illinois\' civil service system, making their personnel choices, and submitting them as requests to be approved or disapproved by the Governor\'s Office.  Among the employment decisions for which approvals have been required are new hires, promotions, transfers, and recalls after layoffs.</p>\n<p>By means of the freeze, according to petitioners, the Governor has been using the Governor\'s Office to operate a political patronage system to limit state employment and beneficial employment-related decisions to those who are supported by the Republican Party.  In reviewing an agency\'s request that a particular applicant be approved for a particular position, the Governor\'s Office has looked at whether the applicant voted in Republican primaries in past election years, whether the applicant has provided financial or other support to the Republican Party and its candidates, whether the applicant has promised to join and work for the Republican Party in the future, and whether the applicant has the support of Republican Party officials at state or local levels.</p>\n<p>Five people (including the three petitioners) brought suit against various Illinois and Republican Party officials in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  They alleged that they had suffered discrimination with respect to state employment because they had not been supporters of the State\'s Republican Party and that this discrimination violates the First Amendment.  Cynthia B. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 497 U. S. 67</a></p><p> Rutan has been working for the State since 1974 as a rehabilitation counselor.  She claims that, since 1981, she has been repeatedly denied promotions to supervisory positions for which she was qualified because she had not worked for or supported the Republican Party.  Franklin Taylor, who operates road equipment for the Illinois Department of Transportation, claims that he was denied a promotion in 1983 because he did not have the support of the local Republican Party.  Taylor also maintains that he was denied a transfer to an office nearer to his home because of opposition from the Republican Party chairmen in the counties in which he worked and to which he requested a transfer.  James W. Moore claims that he has been repeatedly denied state employment as a prison guard because he did not have the support of Republican Party officials.</p>\n<p>The two other plaintiffs, before the Court as cross-respondents, allege that they were not recalled after layoffs because they lacked Republican credentials.  Ricky Standefer was a state garage worker who claims that he was not recalled, although his fellow employees were, because he had voted in a Democratic primary and did not have the support of the Republican Party.  Dan O\'Brien, formerly a dietary manager with the mental health department, contends that he was not recalled after a layoff because of his party affiliation, and that he later obtained a lower-paying position with the corrections department only after receiving support from the chairman of the local Republican Party.</p>\n<p>The District Court dismissed the complaint with prejudice, under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  641 F.Supp. 249 (CD Ill.1986).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit initially issued a panel opinion, 848 F.2d 1396 (1988), but then reheard the appeal en banc.  The court affirmed the District Court\'s decision in part and reversed in part.  868 F.2d 943 (1989).  Noting that this Court had previously determined that the patronage practice of discharging </p><p><a class="page-number" name="68">Page 497 U. S. 68</a></p><p> public employees on the basis of their political affiliation violates the First Amendment, the Court of Appeals held that other patronage practices violate the First Amendment only when they are the "substantial equivalent of a dismissal."  <em>Id.</em> at 954.  The court explained that an employment decision is equivalent to a dismissal when it is one that would lead a reasonable person to resign.  <em>Id.</em> at 955.  The court affirmed the dismissal of Moore\'s claim because it found that basing hiring decisions on political affiliation does not violate the First Amendment, but remanded the remaining claims for further proceedings. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Rutan, Taylor, and Moore petitioned this Court to review the constitutional standard set forth by the Seventh Circuit and the dismissal of Moore\'s claim.  Respondents cross-petitioned this Court, contending that the Seventh Circuit\'s remand of four of the five claims was improper because the employment decisions alleged here do not, as a matter of law, violate the First Amendment.  We granted certiorari, 493 U.S. 807 (1989), to decide the important question whether the First Amendment\'s proscription of patronage dismissals recognized in <em>Elrod,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html">427 U.

The plurality explained that conditioning public employment on the provision of support for the favored political party "unquestionably inhibits protected belief and association."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#359">427 U. S. 359</a></span>.  It reasoned that conditioning employment on political activity pressures employees to pledge political allegiance to a party with which they prefer not to associate, to work for the election of political candidates they do not support, and to contribute money to be used to further policies with which they do not agree.  The latter, the plurality noted, had been recognized by this Court as "tantamount to coerced belief."  <em>Id.,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#355">427 U.

At the same time, employees are constrained from joining, working for or contributing to the political party and candidates of their own choice.  <em>Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#355">427 U.

The plurality acknowledged that a government has a significant interest in ensuring that it has effective and efficient employees.  It expressed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="70">Page 497 U. S. 70</a></p><p> doubt, however, that "mere difference of political persuasion motivates poor performance," and concluded that, in any case, the government can ensure employee effectiveness and efficiency through the less drastic means of discharging staff members whose work is inadequate.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#365">427 U.

Finally, although the plurality recognized that preservation of the democratic process "may in some instances justify limitations on First Amendment freedoms," it concluded that the "process functions as well without the practice, perhaps even better."

Respondents initially contend that the employee petitioners\' First Amendment rights have not been infringed, because they have no entitlement to promotion, transfer, or rehire.  We rejected just such an argument in <em>Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#359">427 U.

We explained the viability of his First Amendment claim as follows:</p>\n<p>"For at least a quarter-century, this Court has made clear that, even though a person has no \'right\' to a valuable governmental benefit, and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, <em>there are some reasons upon which the government may not rely.  It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests -- especially, his interest in freedom of speech.</em>  For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.

[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This is not credible.  Employees who find themselves in dead-end positions due to their political backgrounds are adversely affected.  They will feel a significant obligation to support political positions held by their superiors, and to refrain from acting on the political views they actually hold, in order to progress up the career ladder.  Employees denied transfers to workplaces reasonably close to their homes until they join and work for the Republican Party will feel a daily pressure from their long commutes to do so.  And employees who have been laid off may well feel compelled to engage in whatever political activity is necessary to regain regular paychecks and positions corresponding to their skill and experience. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 497 U. S. 74</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The same First Amendment concerns that underlay our decisions in <em>Elrod, supra,</em> and <em>Branti, supra,</em> are implicated here.  Employees who do not compromise their beliefs stand to lose the considerable increases in pay and job satisfaction attendant to promotions, the hours and maintenance expenses that are consumed by long daily commutes, and even their jobs if they are not rehired after a "temporary" layoff.  These are significant penalties, and are imposed for the exercise of rights guaranteed by the First Amendment.  Unless these patronage practices are narrowly tailored to further vital government interests, we must conclude that they impermissibly encroach on First Amendment freedoms.  <em>See Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#362">427 U.

S. 515</a></span>-516.</p>\n<p>We find, however, that our conclusions in <em>Elrod, supra,</em> and <em>Branti, supra,</em> are equally applicable to the patronage practices at issue here.  A government\'s interest in securing effective employees can be met by discharging, demoting or transferring staff members whose work is deficient.  A government\'s interest in securing employees who will loyally implement its policies can be adequately served by choosing or dismissing certain high-level employees on the basis of their political views.  <em>See Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#365">427 U.

Likewise, the "preservation of the democratic process" is no more furthered by the patronage promotions, transfers, and rehires at issue here than it is by patronage dismissals.  First, "political parties are nurtured by other less intrusive and equally effective methods."  <em>Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#372">427 U. S. 372</a></span>-373.  Political parties have already survived the substantial decline in patronage employment practices in this century.  <em>See Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#369">427 U. S. 369</a></span>, and n. 23; <em>see also</em> L. Sabato, Goodbye to Good-time Charlie 67 (2d ed. 1983) ("The number of patronage positions has significantly decreased in virtually every state"); Congressional Quarterly Inc., State Government, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 497 U. S. 75</a></p><p> CQ\'s Guide to Current Issues and Activities 134 (T. Beyle ed. 1989-1990) ("Linkage[s] between political parties and government office-holding . . . have died out under the pressures of varying forces [including] the declining influence of election workers when compared to media and money-intensive campaigning, such as the distribution of form letters and advertising"); Sorauf, Patronage and Party, 3 Midwest J.Pol.Sci. 115, 118-120 (1959) (many state and local parties have thrived without a patronage system).  Second, patronage decidedly impairs the elective process by discouraging free political expression by public employees.  <em>See Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#372">427 U. S. 372</a></span> (explaining that the proper functioning of a democratic system "is indispensably dependent on the unfettered judgment of each citizen on matters of political concern").  Respondents, who include the Governor of Illinois and other state officials, do not suggest any other overriding government interest in favoring Republican Party supporters for promotion, transfer, and rehire.</p>\n<p>We therefore determine that promotions, transfers, and recalls after layoffs based on political affiliation or support are an impermissible infringement on the First Amendment rights of public employees.  In doing so, we reject the Seventh Circuit\'s view of the appropriate constitutional standard by which to measure alleged patronage practices in government employment.  The Seventh Circuit proposed that only those employment decisions that are the "substantial equivalent of a dismissal" violate a public employee\'s rights under the First Amendment.  868 F.2d at 954-957.  We find this test unduly restrictive, because it fails to recognize that there are deprivations less harsh than dismissal that nevertheless press state employees and applicants to conform their beliefs and associations to some state-selected orthodoxy.  <em>See Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#356">427 U.

Like most employment, it provides regular paychecks, health insurance, and other benefits.  In addition, there may be openings with the State when business in the private sector is slow.  There are also occupations for which the government is a major (or the only) source of employment, such as social workers, elementary school teachers, and prison guards.  Thus, denial of a state job is a serious privation.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, respondents contend that the burden imposed is not of constitutional magnitude. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Decades of decisions by this Court belie such a claim.  We premised <em>Torcaso v.

The Court of Appeals reasoned that "rejecting an employment application does not impose a hardship upon an employee comparable to the loss of [a] job."  <em>Ibid.,</em> citing <em>Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/case.html">476 U. S. 267</a></span> (1986) (plurality opinion).

The court cited a passage from the plurality opinion in <em>Wygant</em> explaining that school boards attempting to redress past discrimination must choose methods that broadly distribute the disadvantages imposed by affirmative action plans among innocent parties.  The plurality said that race-based layoffs placed too great a burden on individual members of the nonminority race, but suggested that discriminatory hiring was permissible, under certain circumstances, even though it burdened white applicants because the burden was less intrusive than the loss of an existing job.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="79">Page 497 U.

The plurality\'s concern in that case was identifying the least harsh means of remedying past wrongs.  It did not question that some remedy was permissible when there was sufficient evidence of past discrimination.  In contrast, the Governor of Illinois has not instituted a remedial undertaking.  It is unnecessary here to consider whether not being hired is less burdensome than being discharged, because the government is not pressed to do either on the basis of political affiliation.  The question in the patronage context is not which penalty is more acute, but whether the government, without sufficient justification, is pressuring employees to discontinue the free exercise of their First Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>If Moore\'s employment application was set aside because he chose not to support the Republican Party, as he asserts, then Moore\'s First Amendment rights have been violated.  Therefore, we find that Moore\'s complaint was improperly dismissed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>We hold that the rule of <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> extends to promotion, transfer, recall, and hiring decisions based on party affiliation and support, and that all of the petitioners and cross-respondents have stated claims upon which relief may be granted.  We affirm the Seventh Circuit insofar as it remanded Rutan\'s, Taylor\'s, Standefer\'s, and O\'Brien\'s claims.  However, we reverse the Circuit Court\'s decision to uphold the dismissal of Moore\'s claim.

The defendants in the lawsuit are various Illinois and Republican Party officials.  We refer to them as "respondents" because they are the respondents in case No. 88-1872.  They are also the cross-petitioners in case No. 88-2074.

The interests that Justice SCALIA regards as potentially furthered by patronage practices are not interests that the government has in its capacity as an employer.  Justice SCALIA describes the possible benefits of patronage as follows: "patronage stabilizes political parties and prevents excessive political fragmentation," <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#104">497 U.

That the government attempts to use public employment to further such interests does not render those interests employment-related.  Therefore, even were Justice SCALIA correct that less-than-strict scrutiny is appropriate when the government takes measures to ensure the proper functioning of its internal operations, such a rule has no relevance to the restrictions on freedom of association and speech at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Branti v.

The question in <em>Johnson</em> was whether the Santa Clara County affirmative action program violated the antidiscrimination requirement of Title VII.  In that context, we said that the denial of a promotion did not unsettle any legitimate, firmly rooted expectations.  We did not dispute, however, that it placed a burden on the person to whom the promotion was denied.  We considered Johnson\'s expectations in discussing whether the plan unnecessarily trammeled the rights of male employees -- <em>i.e.,</em> whether its goal was pursued with an excessive rather than reasonable amount of dislocation.  Our decision that promotion denials are not such an imposition that Title VII prevented Santa Clara from considering gender in order to redress past discrimination does not mean that promotion denials are not enough of an imposition to pressure employees to affiliate with the favored party.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The complaint in this case states that Dan O\'Brien was driven to do exactly this.

The court also expressed concern that the opposite conclusion would open state employment to excessive interference by the federal judiciary.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We respect but do not share this concern.</p>\n<p>Our decision does not impose the federal judiciary\'s supervision on any state government activity that is otherwise immune.

Under Title VII, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2000e(a), (f), and 2000e2(a) (1982 ed.), it is a violation of federal law to discriminate in any way in state employment (excepting certain high-level positions) on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  Moreover, the First Amendment, as the court below noted, already protects state employees not only from patronage dismissals but</p>\n<p>"even an act of retaliation as trivial as failing to hold a birthday party for a public employee . . . when intended to punish her for exercising her free speech rights."</p>\n<p>868 F.2d at 954, n. 4.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>To the extent that respondents also argue that Moore has not been penalized for the exercise of protected speech and association rights because he had no claim of right to employment in the first place, that argument is foreclosed by <em>Perry v.

First, he implies that prohibiting imposition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="80">Page 497 U. S. 80</a></p><p> of an unconstitutional condition upon eligibility for government employment amounts to adoption of a civil service system.  Second, he makes the startling assertion that a long history of open and widespread use of patronage practices immunizes them from constitutional scrutiny.  Third, he assumes that the decisions in <em>Elrod v. Burns,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html">427 U. S. 347</a></span> (1976), and <em>Branti v. Finkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html">445 U. S. 507</a></span> (1980), represented dramatic departures from prior precedent.</p>\n<p>Several years before either <em>Elrod</em> or <em>Branti</em> was decided, I had occasion as a judge on the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit to evaluate each of these propositions.  <em>Illinois State Employees Union, Council 34, Am. Fed of State, County, and Municipal Emp., AFL-CIO v. Lewis,</em> 473 F.2d 561 (1972), <em>cert. denied,</em> 410 U.S. 928 (1973).  With respect to the first, I wrote:</p>\n<p>"Neither this court nor any other may impose a civil service system upon the State of Illinois.  The General Assembly has provided an elaborate system regulating the appointment to specified positions solely on the basis of merit and fitness, the grounds for termination of such employment, and the procedures which must be followed in connection with hiring, firing, promotion, and retirement.  A federal court has no power to establish any such employment code."</p>\n<p>"However, recognition of plaintiffs\' claims will not give every public employee civil service tenure, and will not require the state to follow any set procedure or to assume the burden of explaining or proving the grounds for every termination.  It is the former employee who has the burden of proving that his discharge was motivated by an impermissible consideration.  It is true, of course, that a <em>prima facie</em> case may impose a burden of explanation on the State.  But the burden of proof will remain with the plaintiff employee, and we must assume that the trier of fact will be able to differentiate between those discharges which are politically motivated and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="81">Page 497 U. S. 81</a></p><p> those which are not.  There is a clear distinction between the grant of tenure to an employee -- a right which cannot be conferred by judicial fiat -- and the prohibition of a discharge for a particular impermissible reason.  The Supreme Court has plainly identified that distinction on many occasions, most recently in <em>Perry v. Sindermann,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/408/593/case.html">408 U. S. 593</a></span> (1972)."</p>\n<p>"Unlike a civil service system, the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution does not provide job security, as such, to public employees.  If, however, a discharge is motivated by considerations of race, religion, or punishment of constitutionally protected conduct, it is well settled that the State\'s action is subject to federal judicial review.  There is no merit to the argument that recognition of plaintiffs\' constitutional claim would be tantamount to foisting a civil service code upon the State."</p>\n<p>473 F.2d at 567-568 (footnotes omitted).  Denying the Governor of Illinois the power to require every state employee, and every applicant for state employment, to pledge allegiance and service to the political party in power is a far cry from a civil service code.  The question in this case is simply whether a Governor may adopt a rule that would be plainly unconstitutional if enacted by the General Assembly of Illinois. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Second, Justice SCALIA asserts that</p>\n<p>"when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">497 U.

The argument that traditional practices are immune from constitutional scrutiny is advanced in two plurality opinions that Justice SCALIA has authored, but not by any opinion joined by a majority of the Members of the Court. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>In the <em>Lewis</em> case, I noted the obvious response to this position:</p>\n<p>"if the age of a pernicious practice were a sufficient reason for its continued acceptance, the constitutional attack on racial discrimination would, of course, have been doomed to failure."</p>\n<p>473 F.2d at 568, n. 14.  <em>See, e.g., Brown v.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  I then added </p><p><a class="page-number" name="83">Page 497 U. S. 83</a></p><p> this comment on the specific application of that argument to patronage practices:</p>\n<p>"Finally, our answer to the constitutional question is not foreclosed by the fact that the \'spoils system has been entrenched in American history for almost two hundred years.\'  <em>Alomar v. Dwyer,</em> 447 F.2d 482, 483 (2d Cir.1971).  For most of that period it was assumed, without serious question or debate, that since a public employee has no constitutional right to his job, there can be no valid constitutional objection to his summary removal.  <em>See Bailey v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="84">Page 497 U. S. 84</a></p><p> <em>Richardson,</em> 86 U.S.App.D.C. 248,182 F.2d 46, 59 (1950), <em>affirmed per curiam by an equally divided Court,</em> 341 U.S. 918; <em>Adler v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/342/485/case.html">342 U. S. 485</a></span>.  But as Mr. Justice Marshall so forcefully stated in 1965 when he was a circuit judge,"</p>\n<p>"the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, has been uniformly rejected."</p>\n<p>"<em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents,</em> 345 F.2d 236, 239 (2d Cir.1965).  The development of constitutional law subsequent to the Supreme Court\'s unequivocal repudiation of the line of cases ending with <em>Bailey v. Richardson</em> and <em>Adler v. Board of Education</em> is more relevant than the preceding doctrine which is now \'universally rejected.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Lewis,</em> 473 F.2d at 568 (footnotes and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>With respect to Justice SCALIA\'s view that, until <em>Elrod v. Burns</em> was decided in 1976, it was unthinkable that patronage could be unconstitutional, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#96">497 U. S. 96</a></span>-97, it seems appropriate to point out again not only that my views in <em>Lewis</em> antedated <em>Elrod</em> by several years, but, more importantly, that they were firmly grounded in several decades of decisions of this Court.  As explained in <em>Lewis:</em></p>\n<p>"[In 1947,] a closely divided Supreme Court upheld a statute prohibiting federal civil service employees from taking an active part in partisan political activities.  <em>United Public Workers v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/330/75/case.html">330 U. S. 75</a></span>.  The dissenting Justices felt that such an abridgment of First Amendment rights could not be justified.  The majority, however, concluded that the government\'s interests in not compromising the quality of public service and in not permitting individual employees to use their public offices to advance partisan causes were sufficient to justify the limitation on their freedom."</p>\n<p>"There was no dispute within the Court over the proposition that the employees\' interests in political action were protected by the First Amendment.  The Justices\' different conclusions stemmed from their different appraisals of the sufficiency of the justification for the restriction.  That justification -- the desirability of political neutrality in the public service and the avoidance of the use of the power and prestige of government to favor one party or the other -- would condemn rather than support the alleged conduct of defendant in this case.  Thus, in dicta, the Court unequivocally stated that the Legislature could not require allegiance to a particular political faith as a condition of public employment: "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="85">Page 497 U. S. 85</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"   Appellants urge that federal employees are protected by the Bill of Rights and that Congress may not \'enact a regulation providing that no Republican, Jew or Negro shall be appointed to federal office, or that no federal employee shall attend Mass or take any active part in missionary work.\'  None would deny such limitations on Congressional power but, because there are some limitations, it does not follow that a prohibition against acting as ward leader or worker at the polls is invalid."</p>\n<p>"330 U.S. 75."</p>\n<p>"In 1952, the Court quoted that dicta in support of its holding that the State of Oklahoma could not require its employees to profess their loyalty by denying past association with Communists.  <em>Wieman v. Updegraff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/344/183/case.html">344 U. S. 183</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/344/183/case.html#191">344 U. S. 191</a></span>-192.  That decision did not recognize any special right to public employment; rather, it rested on the impact of the requirement on the citizen\'s First Amendment rights.  We think it unlikely that the Supreme Court would consider these plaintiffs\' interest in freely associating with members of the Democratic Party less worthy of protection than the Oklahoma employees\' interest in associating with Communists or former Communists."</p>\n<p>"In 1961, the Court held that a civilian cook could be summarily excluded from a naval gun factory.  <em>Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, AFL-CIO v. McElroy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/367/886/case.html">367 U. S. 886</a></span>.  The government\'s interest in maintaining the security of the military installation outweighed the cook\'s interest in working at a particular location.  Again, however, the Court explicitly assumed that the sovereign could not deny employment for the reason that the citizen was a member of a particular political party or religious faith -- \'that she could not have been kept out because she was a Democrat or a Methodist.\'  367 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/367/886/case.html#898">367 U.

The Court noted that although criminal sanctions"</p>\n<p>"have a somewhat different impact on the exercise of the right to freedom of speech from dismissal from employment, it is apparent that the threat of dismissal from public employment is nonetheless a potent means of inhibiting speech."</p>\n<p>"<em>Ibid.</em>  The holding in <em>Pickering</em> was a natural sequel to Mr. Justice Frankfurter\'s comment in dissent in <em>Shelton v. Tucker</em> that a scheme to terminate the employment of teachers solely because of their membership in unpopular organizations would run afoul of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/364/479/case.html">364 U.

Sindermann,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/408/593/case.html">408 U. S. 593</a></span>.  The Court\'s explanation of its holding is pertinent here:"</p>\n<p>"   For at least a quarter century, this Court has made clear that, even though a person has no \'right\' to a valuable governmental benefit and even though the government may deny him the benefit for any number of reasons, there are some reasons upon which the government may not act.  It may not deny a benefit to a person on a basis that infringes his constitutionally protected interests -- especially, his interest in freedom of speech.  For if the government could deny a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected speech or associations, his exercise of those freedoms would in effect be penalized and inhibited.  This would allow the government to \'produce a result which [it] could not command directly.\'  <em>Speiser v. Randall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/357/513/case.html">357 U.

When an individual has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="91">Page 497 U.

Jonathan Swift, in his <em>Thoughts on Various Subjects,</em> had said that \'Party is the madness of many, for the gain of the few.\'  This maxim, which was repeated on this side of the Atlantic by men like John Adams and William Paterson, plainly struck a deep resonance in the American mind.  Madison and Hamilton, when they discussed parties or factions (for them the terms were usually interchangeable) in <em>The Federalist,</em> did so only to arraign their bad effects.  In the great debate over the adoption of the Constitution both sides spoke ill of parties.  The popular sage, Franklin (who was not always consistent on the subject), gave an eloquent warning against factions and \'the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of characters.\'  George Washington devoted a large part of his political testament, the Farewell Address, to stern warnings against \'the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party.\'  His successor, John Adams, believed that \'a division of the republic into two great parties . . . is to be dreaded as the greatest political evil under our Constitution.\'  Similar admonitions can be found in the writings of the arch-Federalist Fisher Adams and the \'philosopher of Jeffersonian democracy,\' John Taylor of Carolina.

S. 93</a></p><p> partisanship is not only unneeded but positively undesirable.  It is, however, rare that a federal administration of one party will appoint a judge from another party.  And it has always been rare.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/5/137/case.html">Marbury v. Madison,</a></span></em> 1 Cranch 137 (1803).  Thus, the new principle that the Court today announces will be enforced by a corps of judges (the Members of this Court included) who overwhelmingly owe their office to its violation.  Something must be wrong here, and I suggest it is the Court.</p>\n<p>The merit principle for government employment is probably the most favored in modern America, having been widely adopted by civil-service legislation at both the state and federal levels.  But there is another point of view, described in characteristically Jacksonian fashion by an eminent practitioner of the patronage system, George Washington Plunkitt of Tammany Hall:</p>\n<p>"I ain\'t up on sillygisms, but I can give you some arguments that nobody can answer."</p>\n<p>"First, this great and glorious country was built up by political parties; second, parties can\'t hold together if their workers don\'t get offices when they win; third, if the parties go to pieces, the government they built up must go to pieces, too; fourth, then there\'ll be hell to pay."</p>\n<p>W. Riordon, Plunkitt of Tammany Hall 13 (1963).  It may well be that the Good Government Leagues of America were right, and that Plunkitt, James Michael Curley and their ilk were wrong; but that is not entirely certain.  As the merit principle has been extended and its effects increasingly felt; as the Boss Tweeds, the Tammany Halls, the Pendergast Machines, the Byrd Machines and the Daley Machines have faded into history; we find that political leaders at all levels increasingly complain of the helplessness of elected government, unprotected by "party discipline," before the demands of small and cohesive interest groups. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="94">Page 497 U. S. 94</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The choice between patronage and the merit principle -- or, to be more realistic about it, the choice between the desirable mix of merit and patronage principles in widely varying federal, state, and local political contexts -- is not so clear that I would be prepared, as an original matter, to chisel a single, inflexible prescription into the Constitution.  Fourteen years ago, in <em>Elrod v. Burns,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html">427 U. S. 347</a></span> (1976), the Court did that.  <em>Elrod</em> was limited however, as was the later decision of <em>Branti v. Finkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html">445 U. S. 507</a></span> (1980), to patronage firings, leaving it to state and federal legislatures to determine when and where political affiliation could be taken into account in hirings and promotions.  Today the Court makes its constitutional civil-service reform absolute, extending to all decisions regarding government employment.  Because the First Amendment has never been thought to require this disposition, which may well have disastrous consequences for our political system, I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The restrictions that the Constitution places upon the government in its capacity as lawmaker, <em>i.e.,</em> as the regulator of private conduct, are not the same as the restrictions that it places upon the government in its capacity as employer.  We have recognized this in many contexts, with respect to many different constitutional guarantees.  Private citizens perhaps cannot be prevented from wearing long hair, but policemen can.  <em>Kelley v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/238/case.html">425 U.

Private citizens cannot be punished for refusing to provide the government information that may incriminate them, but government employees can be dismissed when the incriminating information that they refuse to provide relates to the performance of their job.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/273/case.html">Gardner v.

That seems to me not a difficult question, however, in the present context.  The provisions of the Bill of Rights were designed to restrain transient majorities from impairing long-recognized personal liberties.  They did not create by implication novel individual rights overturning accepted political norms.  Thus, when a practice not expressly prohibited by the text of the Bill of Rights bears the endorsement of a long tradition of open, widespread, and unchallenged use that dates back to the beginning of the Republic, we have no proper basis for striking it down. [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  Such a venerable and accepted tradition is not to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="96">Page 497 U. S. 96</a></p><p> be laid on the examining table and scrutinized for its conformity to some abstract principle of First Amendment adjudication devised by this Court.  To the contrary, such traditions are themselves the stuff out of which the Court\'s principles are to be formed.  They are, in these uncertain areas, the very points of reference by which the legitimacy or illegitimacy of other practices are to be figured out.  When it appears that the latest "rule," or "three-part test," or "balancing test" devised by the Court has placed us on a collision course with such a landmark practice, it is the former that must be recalculated by us, and not the latter that must be abandoned by our citizens.  I know of no other way to formulate a constitutional jurisprudence that reflects, as it should, the principles adhered to, over time, by the American people, rather than those favored by the personal (and necessarily shifting) philosophical dispositions of a majority of this Court.</p>\n<p>I will not describe at length the claim of patronage to landmark status as one of our accepted political traditions.  Justice Powell discussed it in his dissenting opinions in <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em>.  <em>Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#378">427 U.

Suffice it to say that patronage was, without any thought that it could be unconstitutional, a basis for government employment from the earliest days of the Republic until <em>Elrod</em> -- and has continued unabated since <em>Elrod</em> to the extent still permitted by that unfortunate decision.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> D.

Clapham ed. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="97">Page 497 U. S. 97</a></p><p> 1982).  Given that unbroken tradition regarding the application of an ambiguous constitutional text, there was in my view no basis for holding that patronage-based dismissals violated the First Amendment -- much less for holding, as the Court does today, that even patronage hiring does so.

Since the government may dismiss an employee for political speech "reasonably deemed by Congress to interfere with the efficiency of the public service," <em>Public Workers v.

For purposes of my ensuing discussion, however, I will apply a less permissive standard that seems more in accord with our general "balancing" test:  can the governmental advantages of this employment practice reasonably be deemed to outweigh its "coercive" effects?</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Preliminarily, I may observe that the Court today not only declines, in this area replete with constitutional ambiguities, to give the clear and continuing tradition of our people the <em>dispositive</em> effect I think it deserves, but even declines to give it substantial weight in the balancing.  That is contrary to what the Court has done in many other contexts.  In evaluating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 497 U. S. 103</a></p><p> so-called "substantive due process" claims, we have examined our history and tradition with respect to the asserted right.  <em>See, e.g., Michael H. v. Gerald D.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/110/case.html">491 U. S. 110</a></span> (1989); <em>Bowers v.

In evaluating claims that a particular procedure violates the Due Process Clause, we have asked whether the procedure is traditional.  <em>See, e.g., Burnham v. Superior Court of California, Marin County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/604/case.html">495 U. S. 604</a></span> (1990).  And in applying the Fourth Amendment\'s reasonableness test, we have looked to the history of judicial and public acceptance of the type of search in question.  <em>See, e.g., Camara v. Municipal Court of San Francisco,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/case.html">387 U.

I assume, as the Court\'s opinion assumes, that the balancing is to be done on a generalized basis, and not case-by-case.  The Court holds that the governmental benefits of patronage cannot reasonably be thought to outweigh its "coercive" effects (even the lesser "coercive" effects of patronage hiring as opposed to patronage firing) not merely in 1990 in the State of Illinois, but at any time in any of the numerous political subdivisions of this vast country.  It seems to me that that categorical pronouncement reflects a naive vision of politics and an inadequate appreciation of the systemic effects of patronage in promoting political stability </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 497 U. S. 104</a></p><p> and facilitating the social and political integration of previously powerless groups.</p>\n<p>The whole point of my dissent is that the desirability of patronage is a policy question to be decided by the people\'s representatives; I do not mean, therefore, to endorse that system.  But in order to demonstrate that a legislature could reasonably determine that its benefits outweigh its "coercive" effects, I must describe those benefits as the proponents of patronage see them:  As Justice Powell discussed at length in his <em>Elrod</em> dissent, patronage stabilizes political parties and prevents excessive political fragmentation -- both of which are results in which States have a strong governmental interest.  Party strength requires the efforts of the rank-and-file, especially in "the dull periods between elections," to perform such tasks as organizing precincts, registering new voters, and providing constituent services.  <em>Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#385">427 U. S. 385</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  Even the most enthusiastic supporter of a party\'s program will shrink before such drudgery, and it is folly to think that ideological conviction alone will motivate sufficient numbers to keep the party going through the off-years.</p>\n<p>"For the most part, as every politician knows, the hope of some reward generates a major portion of the local political activity supporting parties."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  Here is the judgment of one such politician, Jacob Arvey (best known as the promoter of Adlai Stevenson):  Patronage is</p>\n<p>"\'a necessary evil if you want a strong organization, because the patronage system permits of discipline, and without discipline, there\'s no party organization.\'"</p>\n<p>Quoted in M. Tolchin &amp; S. Tolchin, To the Victor 36 (1971).  A major study of the patronage system describes the reality as follows:</p>\n<p>"[A]lthough men have many motives for entering political life . . . the vast underpinning of both major parties is made up of men who seek practical rewards.  Tangible advantages constitute the unifying thread of most successful political practitioners. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 22. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 497 U. S. 105</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"With so little patronage cement, party discipline is relatively low; the rate of participation and amount of service the party can extract from [Montclair] county committeemen are minuscule compared with Cook County.  The party considers itself lucky if 50 percent of its committeemen show up at meetings -- even those labeled \'urgent\' -- while even lower percentages turn out at functions intended to produce crowds for visiting candidates."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 123.  <em>See also</em> W. Grimshaw, The Political Economy of Machine Politics, 4 Corruption and Reform 15, 30 (1989); G. Pomper, Voters, Elections, and Parties 255 (1988); Wolfinger, Why Political Machines Have Not Withered Away and Other Revisionist Thoughts, 34 J.Politics 365, 384 (1972).</p>\n<p>The Court simply refuses to acknowledge the link between patronage and party discipline, and between that and party success.  It relies (as did the plurality in <em>Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#369">427 U. S. 369</a></span>, n. 23) on a single study of a rural Pennsylvania county by Professor Sorauf, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#75">497 U. S. 75</a></span> -- a work that has been described as "more persuasive about the ineffectuality of Democratic leaders in Centre County than about the generalizability of [its] findings."  Wolfinger, <em>supra,</em> at 384, n. 39.  It is unpersuasive to claim, as the Court does, that party workers are obsolete because campaigns are now conducted through media and other money-intensive means.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#75">497 U. S. 75</a></span>.  Those techniques have supplemented but not supplanted personal contacts.  <em>See</em> Price, Bringing Back the Parties, at 25.  Certainly they have not made personal contacts unnecessary in campaigns for the lower-level offices that are the foundations of party strength, nor have they replaced the myriad functions performed by party regulars not directly related to campaigning.  And to the extent such techniques have replaced older methods of campaigning (partly in response to the limitations the Court has placed on patronage), the political system is not clearly better off.  <em>See Elrod, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#384">427 U. S. 384</a></span> (Powell, J., dissenting); <em>Branti,</em> 445 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 497 U. S. 106</a></p><p> U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html#528">445 U. S. 528</a></span> (Powell, J., dissenting).  Increased reliance on money-intensive campaign techniques tends to entrench those in power much more effectively than patronage -- but without the attendant benefit of strengthening the party system.  A challenger can more easily obtain the support of party workers (who can expect to be rewarded even if the candidate loses -- if not this year, then the next) than the financial support of political action committees (which will generally support incumbents, who are likely to prevail).</p>\n<p>It is self-evident that eliminating patronage will significantly undermine party discipline, and that, as party discipline wanes, so will the strength of the two-party system.  But, says the Court, "[p]olitical parties have already survived the substantial decline in patronage employment practices in this century."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#74">497 U. S. 74</a></span>.  This is almost verbatim what was said in <em>Elrod, see</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#369">427 U. S. 369</a></span>.  Fourteen years later, it seems much less convincing.  Indeed, now that we have witnessed, in 18 of the last 22 years, an Executive Branch of the Federal Government under the control of one party while the Congress is entirely or (for two years) partially within the control of the other party; now that we have undergone the most recent federal election, in which 98% of the incumbents, of whatever party, were returned to office; and now that we have seen elected officials changing their political affiliation with unprecedented readiness, Washington Post, Apr. 10, 1990, p. A1, the statement that "political parties have already survived" has a positively whistling-in-the-graveyard character to it.  Parties have assuredly survived -- but as what?  As the forges upon which many of the essential compromises of American political life are hammered out?  Or merely as convenient vehicles for the conducting of national presidential elections?</p>\n<p>The patronage system does not, of course, merely foster political parties in general; it fosters the two-party system in particular.  When getting a job, as opposed to effectuating a particular substantive policy, is an available incentive for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 497 U. S. 107</a></p><p> party workers, those attracted by that incentive are likely to work for the party that has the best chance of displacing the "ins," rather than for some splinter group that has a more attractive political philosophy but little hope of success.  Not only is a two-party system more likely to emerge, but the differences between those parties are more likely to be moderated, as each has a relatively greater interest in appealing to a majority of the electorate and a relatively lesser interest in furthering philosophies or programs that are far from the mainstream.  The stabilizing effects of such a system are obvious.  <em>See</em> Toinet &amp; Glenn, Clientelism and Corruption in the "Open" Society, at 208.  In the context of electoral laws, we have approved the States\' pursuit of such stability and their avoidance of the "splintered parties and unrestrained factionalism [that] may do significant damage to the fabric of government."  <em>Storer v. Brown,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html">415 U. S. 724</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/case.html#736">415 U. S. 736</a></span> (1974) (upholding law disqualifying persons from running as independents if affiliated with a party in the past year).</p>\n<p>Equally apparent is the relatively destabilizing nature of a system in which candidates cannot rely upon patronage-based party loyalty for their campaign support, but must attract workers and raise funds by appealing to various interest-groups.  <em>See</em> Tolchin &amp; Tolchin, To the Victor, at 127-130.  There is little doubt that our decisions in <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti,</em> by contributing to the decline of party strength, have also contributed to the growth of interest-group politics in the last decade.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Fitts, The Vice of Virtue, 136 U.Pa.L.Rev. 1567, 1603-1607 (1988).  Our decision today will greatly accelerate the trend.  It is not only campaigns that are affected, of course, but the subsequent behavior of politicians once they are in power.  The replacement of a system firmly based in party discipline with one in which each officeholder comes to his own accommodation with competing interest groups produces "a dispersion of political influence that may inhibit a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 497 U. S. 108</a></p><p> political party from enacting its programs into law."  <em>Branti, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html#531">445 U. S. 531</a></span> (Powell, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Patronage, moreover, has been a powerful means of achieving the social and political integration of excluded groups.  <em>See, e.g., Elrod, supra,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#379">427 U.

By supporting and ultimately dominating a particular party "machine," racial and ethnic minorities have -- on the basis of their politics, rather than their race or ethnicity -- acquired the patronage awards the machine had power to confer. No one disputes the historical accuracy of this observation, and there is no reason to think that patronage can no longer serve that function.  The abolition of patronage, however, prevents groups that have only recently obtained political power, especially blacks, from following this path to economic and social advancement.</p>\n<p>"Every ethnic group that has achieved political power in American cities has used the bureaucracy to provide jobs in return for political support.  It\'s only when Blacks begin to play the same game that the rules get changed.  Now the use of such jobs to build political bases becomes an \'evil\' activity, and the city insists on taking the control back \'downtown.\'"</p>\n<p>New York Amsterdam News, Apr. 1, 1978, p. A-4, quoted in Hamilton, The Patron-Recipient Relationship and Minority Politics in New York City, 94 Pol.Sci.Q. 211, 212 (1979).</p>\n<p>While the patronage system has the benefits argued for above, it also has undoubted disadvantages.  It facilitates financial corruption, such as salary kickbacks and partisan political activity on government-paid time.  It reduces the efficiency </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 497 U. S. 109</a></p><p> of government, because it creates incentives to hire more and less-qualified workers and because highly qualified workers are reluctant to accept jobs that may only last until the next election.  And, of course, it applies some greater or lesser inducement for individuals to join and work for the party in power.</p>\n<p>To hear the Court tell it, this last is the greatest evil.  That is not my view, and it has not historically been the view of the American people.  Corruption and inefficiency, rather than abridgement of liberty, have been the major criticisms leading to enactment of the civil-service laws -- for the very good reason that the patronage system does not have as harsh an effect upon conscience, expression, and association as the Court suggests.  As described above, it is the nature of the pragmatic, patronage-based, two-party system to build alliances and to suppress rather than foster ideological tests for participation in the division of political "spoils."  What the patronage system ordinarily demands of the party worker is loyalty to, and activity on behalf of, the organization itself, rather than a set of political beliefs.  He is generally free to urge <em>within the organization</em> the adoption of any political position; but if that position is rejected, he must vote and work for the party nonetheless.  The diversity of political expression (other than expression of party loyalty) is channeled, in other words, to a different stage -- to the contests for party endorsement, rather than the partisan elections.  It is undeniable, of course, that the patronage system entails some constraint upon the expression of views, particularly at the partisan-election stage, and considerable constraint upon the employee\'s right to associate with the other party.  It greatly exaggerates these, however, to describe them as a general "<em>coercion of belief,\'" <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#71">497 U.

S. 110</a></em></p><p><em> offered a bribe is not "coerced" to violate the law, and the private citizen offered a patronage job is not "coerced" to work for the party.  In sum, I do not deny that the patronage system influences or redirects, perhaps to a substantial degree, individual political expression and political association.  But, like the many generations of Americans that have preceded us, I do not consider that a significant impairment of free speech or free association.\n</em></p>\n<p>In emphasizing the advantages and minimizing the disadvantages (or at least minimizing one of the disadvantages) of the patronage system, I do not mean to suggest that that system is best.  It may not always be; it may never be.  To oppose our <em>Elrod-Branti</em> jurisprudence, one need not believe that the patronage system is <em>necessarily</em> desirable; nor even that it is always and everywhere <em>arguably</em> desirable, but merely that it is a political arrangement that may sometimes be a reasonable choice, and should therefore be left to the judgment of the people\'s elected representatives.  The choice in question, I emphasize, is not just between patronage and a merit-based civil service, but rather among various combinations of the two that may suit different political units and different eras:  permitting patronage hiring, for example, but prohibiting patronage dismissal; permitting patronage in most municipal agencies but prohibiting it in the police department; or permitting it in the mayor\'s office but prohibiting it everywhere else.  I find it impossible to say that, always and everywhere, all of these choices fail our "balancing" test.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The last point explains why <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> should be overruled, rather than merely not extended.  Even in the field of constitutional adjudication, where the pull of stare decisis is at its weakest, <em>see Glidden Co. v. Zdanok,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html">370 U. S. 530</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html#543">370 U. S. 543</a></span> (1962) (opinion of Harlan, J.), one is reluctant to depart from precedent.  But when that precedent is not only wrong, not only recent, not only contradicted by a long prior </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 497 U. S. 111</a></p><p> tradition, but also has proved unworkable in practice, then all reluctance ought to disappear.  In my view that is the situation here.  Though unwilling to leave it to the political process to draw the line between desirable and undesirable patronage, the Court has neither been prepared to rule that no such line exists (<em>i.e.,</em> that all patronage is unconstitutional) nor able to design the line itself in a manner that judges, lawyers, and public employees can understand.  <em>Elrod</em> allowed patronage dismissals of persons in "policymaking" or "confidential" positions.  427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#367">427 U. S. 367</a></span> (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em> at 375 (Stewart, J., concurring).  <em>Branti</em> retreated from that formulation, asking instead</p>\n<p>"whether the hiring authority can demonstrate that party affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved."</p>\n<p>445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html#518">445 U. S. 518</a></span>.  What that means is anybody\'s guess.  The Courts of Appeals have devised various tests for determining when "affiliation is an appropriate requirement."  <em>See generally</em> Martin, A Decade of <em>Branti</em> Decisions:  A Government Officials\' Guide to Patronage Dismissals, 39 Am.U.L.Rev. 11, 23-42 (1989).  These interpretations of <em>Branti</em> are not only significantly at variance with each other, they are still so general that for most positions it is impossible to know whether party affiliation is a permissible requirement until a court renders its decision.</p>\n<p>A few examples will illustrate the shambles <em>Branti</em> has produced.  A city cannot fire a deputy sheriff because of his political affiliation, [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>] but then again perhaps it can, [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>] especially if he is called the "police captain." [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  A county cannot fire on that basis its attorney for the department of social </p><p><a class="page-number" name="112">Page 497 U. S. 112</a></p><p> services, [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>] nor its assistant attorney for family court, [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>] but a city can fire its solicitor and his assistants, [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>] or its assistant city attorney, [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>] or its assistant state\'s attorney, [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>] or its corporation counsel. [<a href="#F3/13" name="T3/13">Footnote 3/13</a>]  A city cannot discharge its deputy court clerk for his political affiliation, [<a href="#F3/14" name="T3/14">Footnote 3/14</a>] but it can fire its legal assistant to the clerk on that basis. [<a href="#F3/15" name="T3/15">Footnote 3/15</a>]  Firing a juvenile court bailiff seems impermissible, [<a href="#F3/16" name="T3/16">Footnote 3/16</a>] but it may be permissible if he is assigned permanently to a single judge. [<a href="#F3/17" name="T3/17">Footnote 3/17</a>]  A city cannot fire on partisan grounds its director of roads, [<a href="#F3/18" name="T3/18">Footnote 3/18</a>] but it can fire the second in command of the water department. [<a href="#F3/19" name="T3/19">Footnote 3/19</a>]  A government cannot discharge for political reasons the senior vice president of its development bank, [<a href="#F3/20" name="T3/20">Footnote 3/20</a>] but it can discharge the regional director of its rural housing administration. [<a href="#F3/21" name="T3/21">Footnote 3/21</a>]</p>\n<p>The examples could be multiplied, but this summary should make obvious that the "tests" devised to implement <em>Branti</em> have produced inconsistent and unpredictable results.  That uncertainty undermines the purpose of both the nonpatronage </p><p><a class="page-number" name="113">Page 497 U. S. 113</a></p><p> rule and the exception.  The rule achieves its objective of preventing the "coercion" of political affiliation, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#97">497 U. S. 97</a></span>, only if the employee is confident that he can engage in (or refrain from) political activities without risking dismissal.  Since the current doctrine leaves many employees utterly in the dark about whether their jobs are protected, they are likely to play it safe.  On the other side, the exception was designed to permit the government to implement its electoral mandate. <em>Elrod, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#367">427 U. S. 367</a></span> (plurality opinion).  But unless the government is fairly sure that dismissal is permitted, it will leave the politically uncongenial official in place, since an incorrect decision will expose it to lengthy litigation and a large damage award, perhaps even against the responsible officials personally.</p>\n<p>This uncertainty and confusion are not the result of the fact that <em>Elrod,</em> and then <em>Branti,</em> chose the wrong "line."  My point is that there is no right line -- or at least no right line that can be nationally applied and that is known by judges.  Once we reject as the criterion a long political tradition showing that party-based </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 497 U. S. 114</a></p><p> employment is entirely permissible, yet are unwilling (as any reasonable person must be) to replace it with the principle that party-based employment is entirely impermissible, we have left the realm of law and entered the domain of political science, seeking to ascertain when and where the undoubted benefits of political hiring and firing are worth its undoubted costs.  The answer to that will vary from State to State, and indeed from city to city, even if one rejects out of hand (as the <em>Branti</em> line does) the benefits associated with party stability.  Indeed, the answer will even vary from year to year.  During one period, for example, it may be desirable for the manager of a municipally owned public utility to be a career specialist, insulated from the political system.  During another, when the efficient operation of that utility or even its very existence has become a burning political issue, it may be desirable that he be hired and fired on a political basis.  The appropriate "mix" of party-based employment is a political question if there ever was one, and we should give it back to the voters of the various political units to decide, through civil-service legislation crafted to suit the time and place, which mix is best.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even were I not convinced that <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> were wrongly decided, I would hold that they should not be extended beyond their facts, <em>viz.,</em> actual discharge of employees for their political affiliation.  Those cases invalidated patronage firing in order to prevent the "restraint it places on freedoms of belief and association."  <em>Elrod,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#355">427 U. S. 355</a></span> (plurality opinion); <em>see also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html#357">427 U. S. 357</a></span> (patronage "compels or restrains" and "inhibits" belief and association).  The loss of one\'s current livelihood is an appreciably greater constraint than such other disappointments as the failure to obtain a promotion or selection for an uncongenial transfer.  Even if the "coercive" effect of the former has been held always to outweigh the benefits of party-based employment decisions, the "coercive" effect of the latter should not be.  We have drawn a line between firing and other employment decisions in other contexts, <em>see Wygant v. Jackson Bd. of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/case.html">476 U. S. 267</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/476/267/case.html#282">476 U. S. 282</a></span>-283 (1986) (plurality opinion), and should do so here as well.</p>\n<p>I would reject the alternative that the Seventh Circuit adopted in this case, which allows a cause of action if the employee can demonstrate that he was subjected to the "substantial equivalent of dismissal."  868 F.2d 943, 950, 954 (CA7 1989).  The trouble with that seemingly reasonable standard is that it is so imprecise that it will multiply yet again the harmful uncertainty and litigation that <em>Branti</em> has already created.  If <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> are not to be reconsidered in light of their demonstrably unsatisfactory consequences, I would go no further than to allow a cause of action when the employee has lost his position, that is, his formal title and salary.  That narrow ground alone is enough to resolve the constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 497 U. S. 115</a></p><p> claims in the present case.  Since none of the plaintiffs has alleged loss of his position because of affiliation, [<a href="#F3/22" name="T3/22">Footnote 3/22</a>] I would affirm the Seventh Circuit\'s judgment insofar as it affirmed the dismissal of petitioners\' claims, and would reverse the Seventh Circuit\'s judgment insofar as it reversed the dismissal of cross-respondent\'s claims.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion, of course, not only declines to confine <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> to dismissals in the narrow sense I have proposed but, unlike the Seventh Circuit, even extends those opinions beyond "constructive" dismissals -- indeed, even beyond adverse treatment of current employees -- to all hiring decisions.  In the long run, there may be cause to rejoice in that extension.  When the courts are flooded with litigation under that most unmanageable of standards (<em>Branti</em>) brought by that most persistent and tenacious of suitors (the disappointed office-seeker), we may be moved to reconsider our intrusion into this entire field.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The customary invocation of <em>Brown v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/case.html">347 U. S. 483</a></span> (1954), as demonstrating the dangerous consequences of this principle, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#82">497 U. S. 82</a></span> (STEVENS, J., concurring), is unsupportable.  I argue for the role of tradition in giving content only to <em>ambiguous</em> constitutional text; no tradition can supersede the Constitution.  In my view, the Fourteenth Amendment\'s requirement of "equal protection of the laws," combined with the Thirteenth Amendment\'s abolition of the institution of black slavery, leaves no room for doubt that laws treating people differently because of their race are invalid.  Moreover, even if one does not regard the Fourteenth Amendment as crystal clear on this point, a tradition of <em>unchallenged</em> validity did not exist with respect to the practice in <em>Brown.</em>  To the contrary, in the 19th century, the principle of "separate-but-equal" had been vigorously opposed on constitutional grounds, litigated up to this Court, and upheld only over the dissent of one of our historically most respected Justices.  <em>See Plessy v. Ferguson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/537/case.html">163 U. S. 537</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/163/537/case.html#555">163 U. S. 555</a></span>-556 (1896) (Harlan, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Justice STEVENS seeks to counteract this tradition by relying upon the supposed "unequivocal repudiation" of the right-privilege distinction.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#83">497 U. S. 83</a></span>.  That will not do.  If the right-privilege distinction was once used to explain the practice, and if that distinction is to be repudiated, then one must simply devise some other theory to explain it.  The order of precedence is that a constitutional theory must be wrong if its application contradicts a clear constitutional tradition, not that a clear constitutional tradition must be wrong if it does not conform to the current constitutional theory.  On Justice STEVENS\' view of the matter, this Court examines a historical practice, endows it with an intellectual foundation, and later, by simply undermining that foundation, relegates the constitutional tradition to the dustbin of history.  That is not how constitutional adjudication works.  <em>Cf. Burnham v. Superior Court of California, Marin County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/495/604/case.html">495 U. S. 604</a></span> (1990) (opinion of SCALIA, J.).  I am not sure, in any event, that the right-privilege distinction has been as unequivocally rejected as Justice STEVENS supposes.  It has certainly been recognized that the fact that the government need not confer a certain benefit does not mean that it can attach any conditions whatever to the conferral of that benefit.  But it remains true that certain conditions can be attached to benefits that cannot be imposed as prescriptions upon the public at large.  If Justice STEVENS chooses to call this something other than a right-privilege distinction, that is fine and good -- but it is, in any case, what explains the nonpatronage restrictions upon federal employees that the Court continues to approve, and there is no reason why it cannot support patronage restrictions as well.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court calls our description of the appropriate standard of review "questionable," and suggests that these cases applied strict scrutiny ("even <em>were</em> Justice SCALIA correct that less-than-strict scrutiny is appropriate").  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#70">497 U. S. 70</a></span>, n. 4 (emphasis added).  This suggestion is incorrect, does not aid the Court\'s argument, and, if accepted would eviscerate the strict-scrutiny standard.  It is incorrect because even a casual perusal of the cases reveals that the governmental actions were sustained not because they were shown to be "narrowly tailored to further vital government interests," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#74">497 U. S. 74</a></span>, but because they were "reasonably" deemed necessary to promote effective government.  It does not aid the Court\'s argument, moreover, because <em>whatever</em> standard those cases applied must be applied here, and if the asserted interests in patronage are as weighty as those proffered in the previous cases, then <em>Elrod</em> and <em>Branti</em> were wrongly decided.  It eviscerates the standard, finally, because, if the practices upheld in those cases survived strict scrutiny, then the so-called "strict scrutiny" test means nothing.  Suppose a State made it unlawful for an employee of a privately owned nuclear power plant to criticize his employer.  Can there be any doubt that we would reject out of hand the State\'s argument that the statute was justified by the compelling interest in maintaining the appearance that such employees are operating nuclear plants properly, so as to maintain public confidence in the plants\' safety?  <em>But cf. CSC v. Letter Carriers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html">413 U. S. 548</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html#565">413 U. S. 565</a></span> (1973) (Hatch Act justified by need for government employees to "appear to the public to be avoiding [political partiality], if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded").  Suppose again that a State prohibited a private employee from speaking on the job about matters of private concern.  Would we even hesitate before dismissing the State\'s claim that the compelling interest in fostering an efficient economy overrides the individual\'s interest in speaking on such matters?  <em>But cf. Connick v. Myers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html">461 U. S. 138</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#147">461 U. S. 147</a></span> (1983) ("[W]hen a public employee speaks . . . upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\'s behavior").  If the Court thinks that strict scrutiny is appropriate in all these cases, then it should forthrightly admit that <em>Public Workers v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/75/case.html">330 U. S. 75</a></span> (1947), <em>Letter Carriers, supra; Pickering v.

S. 563</a></span> (1968), <em>Connick,</em> and similar cases were mistaken, and should be overruled; if it rejects that course, then it should admit that those cases applied, as they said they did, a reasonableness test.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s further contention that these cases are limited to the "interests that the government has in its capacity as an employer," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/62/case.html#70">497 U. S. 70</a></span>, n. 4, as distinct from its interests "in the structure and functioning of society as a whole," <em>ibid.,</em> is neither true nor relevant.  Surely a principal reason for the statutes that we have upheld preventing political activity by government employees -- and indeed the <em>only</em> substantial reason, with respect to those employees who are permitted to be hired and fired on a political basis -- is to prevent the party in power from obtaining what is considered an unfair advantage in political campaigns.  That is precisely the type of governmental interest at issue here.  But even if the Court were correct, I see no reason in policy or principle why the government would be limited to furthering only its interests "as employer."  In fact, we have seemingly approved the furtherance of broader governmental interests through employment restrictions.  In <em>Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/88/case.html">426 U. S. 88</a></span> (1976), we held unlawful a Civil Service Commission regulation prohibiting the hiring of aliens on the ground that the Commission lacked the requisite authority.  We were willing, however, to</p>\n<p>"assume . . . that, if the Congress or the President had expressly imposed the citizenship requirement, it would be justified by the national interest in providing an incentive for aliens to become naturalized, or possibly even as providing the President with an expendable token for treaty negotiating purposes."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/88/case.html#105">426 U.

In other cases, the lower federal courts have uniformly reached the same result.  <em>See, e.g., Jalil v. Campbell,</em> 192 U.S.App. D.C. 4, 7, 590 F.2d 1120, 1123, n. 3 (1978); <em>Vergara v.
