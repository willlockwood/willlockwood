That the vessel called the <em>Cassius</em> was originally equipped and fitted for war in the port of Philadelphia, in Pennsylvania, one of the United States of America, contrary to the laws of the said United States and the laws and usages of nations.  That your libellant has never received compensation for the damages he has suffered, and has not been able to retrieve the said vessel, with her tackle, apparel, and furniture.

Davis, and the said corvette or vessel of war, the <em>Cassius,</em> her tackle, apparel and furniture, exhibited and promoted, craftily and subtly there alleging, articulating, and objecting that on the said 20 May now last past, the said Samuel B.
