(Supp. III) 1272(e)(5). The United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio dismissed the complaint for lack of jurisdiction, holding that 526( a)(1) of the Act, 30 U.S.C. (Supp. III) 1276(a)(1), permits challenges to such regulations to be brought only in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. </p><p> The United States Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case for consideration of the merits.

First, 526(a)( 1) provides that regulations with a national impact be reviewed in the District of Columbia, those with a statewide impact in the district court for the district of the capital of the state involved, and all other regulations only in the district where the surface mining operation at issue is located. By allowing a national regulation to be challenged in federal courts other than those in the District of Columbia, the Court of Appeals here arguably frustrated Congress\' carefully devised plan for judicial review. Second, the court below based its holding on the fact that both the House 2 and Senate 3 versions of the bill provided that national regulations were to be reviewed only in the District Court for the District of Columbia, while the word "only" was omitted from the final version of the bill reported out of the Conference Committee. However, the Conference Committee\'s discussion of the changes made in the bill does not even mention this deletion, and it may well have been inadvertent. H.

Finally, the only other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="997">Page 456 U.S. 995 , 997</a></p><p> courts to rule on this question have both held that 526(a)(1) provides for exclusive review of national regulations in the District Court for the District of Columbia. Reading Anthracite v. Office of Surface Mining, Reclamation and Enforcement, No. 80-0667 (ED Pa. Oct. 8, 1980); Union Carbide Corp. v. Andrus, 13 ERC 1481, 1489 (SD W.Va.1979). </p><p> Because there are serious questions whether the Court of Appeals properly interpreted 526(a)(1) and because such an interpretation appears to conflict with the congressional intent that there be uniform national performance standards for surface mining, see S.Rep.No.95-128, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 49 (1977); H.R.Rep.No.95-218, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 58 (1977), I would grant the petition for certiorari and set the case for oral argument. Delaying resolution of the issue could cause substantial disruption both to the coal mining industry and to the agencies charged with administering the Surface Mining Act.
