THOMPKINS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x931470.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 1, 2010\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 1, 2010</p>\n<p align="left">After advising respondent Thompkins of his rights, in full compliance with <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a>, Detective Helgert and another Michigan officer interrogated him about a shooting in which one victim died.  At no point did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he wanted an attorney.  He was largely silent during the 3-hour interrogation, but near the end, he answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d when asked if he prayed to God to forgive him for the shooting.  He moved to suppress his statements, claiming that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, that he had not waived that right, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.  At trial on first-degree murder and other charges, the prosecution called Eric Purifoy, who drove the van in which Thompkins and a third accomplice were riding at the time of the shooting, and who had been convicted of firearm offenses but acquitted of murder and assault.  Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 defense was that Purifoy was the shooter.  Purifoy testified that he did not see who fired the shots.  During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied about not seeing the shooter and pondered whether Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s jury had made the right decision.  Defense counsel did not ask the court to instruct the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial only to assess his credibility, not to establish Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 guilt.  The jury found Thompkins guilty, and he was sentenced to life in prison without parole.  In denying his motion for a new trial, the trial court rejected as nonprejudicial his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim for failure to request a limiting instruction about the outcome of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  On appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals rejected both Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Miranda </em>and his ineffective-assistance claims.  The Federal District Court denied his subsequent habeas request, reasoning that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not coerced into making statements during the interrogation, and that it was not unreasonable, for purposes of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), for the State Court of Appeals to determine that he had waived his right to remain silent.  The Sixth Circuit reversed, holding that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 right to remain silent and in rejecting his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rejecting Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Miranda </em>claim was correct under <em>de novo</em> review and therefore necessarily reasonable under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s more deferential standard of review.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 silence during the interrogation did not invoke his right to remain silent.  A suspect\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel must be invoked \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/452/index.html">512 U. S. 452</a>, 459.  If the accused makes an \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous or equivocal\xe2\x80\x9d statement or no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, <em>ibid.</em>, or ask questions to clarify the accused\xe2\x80\x99s intent, <em>id.,</em> at 461\xe2\x80\x93462.  There is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda</em> right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda</em> right to counsel at issue in <em>Davis</em>.  Both protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked.  The unambiguous invocation requirement results in an objective inquiry that \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and \xe2\x80\xa6 provide[s] guidance to officers\xe2\x80\x9d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  Had Thompkins said that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk, he would have invoked his right to end the questioning.  He did neither.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Thompkins waived his right to remain silent when he knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police.  A waiver must be \xe2\x80\x9cthe product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 421.  Such a waiver may be \xe2\x80\x9cimplied\xe2\x80\x9d through a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>North Carolina</em> v. <em>Butler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/369/index.html">441 U. S. 369</a>, 373.  If the State establishes that a <em>Miranda</em> warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accused\xe2\x80\x99s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver.  The record here shows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.  First, the lack of any contention that he did not understand his rights indicates that he knew what he gave up when he spoke.  See <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 421.  Second, his answer to the question about God is a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\xe2\x80\x9d of that right.  <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373.  Had he wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response or unambiguously invoked his <em>Miranda</em> rights, ending the interrogation.  That he made a statement nearly three hours after receiving a <em>Miranda</em> warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver.  Third, there is no evidence that his statement was coerced.  See <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 421.  He does not claim that police threatened or injured him or that he was fearful.  The interrogation took place in a standard-sized room in the middle of the day, and there is no authority for the proposition that a 3-hour interrogation is inherently coercive.  Cf. <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Connelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/index.html">479 U. S. 157</a>, 163\xe2\x80\x93164, n.\xc2\xa01.  The fact that the question referred to religious beliefs also does not render his statement involuntary.  <em>Id.</em>, at 170.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Thompkins argues that, even if his answer to Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him until they first obtained a waiver.  However, a rule requiring a waiver at the outset would be inconsistent with <em>Butler</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that courts can infer a waiver \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the actions and words of the person interrogated.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U. S., at 373.  Any waiver, express or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time, terminating further interrogation.  When the suspect knows that <em>Miranda</em> rights can be invoked at any time, he or she can reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests as the interrogation progresses.  After giving a <em>Miranda</em> warning, police may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Thus, the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Miranda</em> rights before interrogating him.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Even if his counsel provided ineffective assistance, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under a <em>de novo</em> review of this record.  To establish ineffective assistance, a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cmust show both deficient performance and prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.  To establish prejudice, a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 694, considering \xe2\x80\x9cthe totality of the evidence before the judge or jury,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 695.  Here, the Sixth Circuit did not account for the other evidence presented against Thompkins.  The state court rejected his claim that he was prejudiced by evidence of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s earlier conviction.  Even if it used an incorrect legal standard, this Court need not determine whether AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review applies here, since Thompkins cannot show prejudice under <em>de novo </em>review, a more favorable standard for him.  <em>De novo</em> review can be used in this case because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to relief if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo</em> review.  See \xc2\xa72254(a).  Assuming that failure to request a limiting instruction here was deficient representation, Thompkins cannot show prejudice, for the record shows that it was not reasonably likely that such an instruction would have made any difference in light of other evidence of guilt.  The surviving victim identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the identification was supported by a surveillance camera photograph.  A friend testified that Thompkins confessed to him, and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped and abandoned the van after the shooting.  The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, as it was instructed to do.

First, the Court of Appeals determined that a statement by the accused, relied on at trial by the prosecution, had been elicited in violation of <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966).  Second, it found that failure to ask for an instruction relating to testimony from an accomplice was ineffective assistance by defense counsel.  See <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  Both of these contentions had been rejected in Michigan courts and in the habeas corpus proceedings before the United States District Court.  Certiorari was granted to review the decision by the Court of Appeals on both points.  The warden of a Michigan correctional facility is the petitioner here, and Van Chester Thompkins, who was convicted, is the respondent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On January 10, 2000, a shooting occurred outside a mall in Southfield, Michigan.  Among the victims was Samuel Morris, who died from multiple gunshot wounds.  The other victim, Frederick France, recovered from his injuries and later testified.  Thompkins, who was a suspect, fled.  About one year later he was found in Ohio and arrested there.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two Southfield police officers traveled to Ohio to interrogate Thompkins, then awaiting transfer to Michigan.  The interrogation began around 1:30 p.m. and lasted about three hours.  The interrogation was conducted in a room that was 8 by 10 feet, and Thompkins sat in a chair that resembled a school desk (it had an arm on it that swings around to provide a surface to write on).  App. 144a\xe2\x80\x93145a.  At the beginning of the interrogation, one of the officers, Detective Helgert, presented Thompkins with a form derived from the <em>Miranda</em> rule.  It stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNOTIFICATION OF CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND STATEMENT</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c1.\xe2\x80\x82You have the right to remain silent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c2.\xe2\x80\x82Anything you say can and will be used against\nyou in a court of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c3.\xe2\x80\x82You have a right to talk to a lawyer before answering \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0any questions and you have the right to have a lawyer present with you while you are answering any \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0questions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c4.\xe2\x80\x82If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before any questioning, if you wish one.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c5.\xe2\x80\x82You have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 60 (some capitalization omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Helgert asked Thompkins to read the fifth warning out loud.  App. 8a.  Thompkins complied.  Helgert later said this was to ensure that Thompkins could read, and Helgert concluded that Thompkins understood English.  <em>Id.</em>, at 9a.  Helgert then read the other four <em>Miranda</em> warnings out loud and asked Thompkins to sign the form to demonstrate that he understood his rights.  App. 8a\xe2\x80\x939a.  Thompkins declined to sign the form.  The record contains conflicting evidence about whether Thompkins then verbally confirmed that he understood the rights listed on the form.  Compare <em>id.</em>, at 9a (at a suppression hearing, Helgert testified that Thompkins verbally confirmed that he understood his rights), with <em>id.</em>, at 148a (at trial, Helgert stated, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know that I orally asked him\xe2\x80\x9d whether Thompkins understood his rights).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Officers began an interrogation.  At no point during the interrogation did Thompkins say that he wanted to remain silent, that he did not want to talk with the police, or that he wanted an attorney.  <em>Id.</em>, at 10a.  Thompkins was \xe2\x80\x9c[l]argely\xe2\x80\x9d silent during the interrogation, which lasted about three hours.  <em>Id.</em>, at 19a.  He did give a few limited verbal responses, however, such as \xe2\x80\x9cyeah,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x9d  And on occasion he communicated by nodding his head.  <em>Id.</em>, at 23a.  Thompkins also said that he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t want a peppermint\xe2\x80\x9d that was offered to him by the police and that the chair he was \xe2\x80\x9csitting in was hard.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 152a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About 2 hours and 45 minutes into the interrogation, Helgert asked Thompkins, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you believe in God?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11a, 153a.  Thompkins made eye contact with Helgert and said \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d as his eyes \xe2\x80\x9cwell[ed] up with tears.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11a.  Helgert asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you pray to God?\xe2\x80\x9d  Thompkins said \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 11a, 153a.  Helgert asked, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you pray to God to forgive you for shooting that boy down?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 153a.  Thompkins answered \xe2\x80\x9cYes\xe2\x80\x9d and looked away.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thompkins refused to make a written confession, and the interrogation ended about 15 minutes later.  <em>Id.</em>, at 11a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins was charged with first-degree murder, assault with intent to commit murder, and certain firearms-related offenses.  He moved to suppress the statements made during the interrogation.  He argued that he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right to remain silent, requiring police to end the interrogation at once, see <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Mosley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/index.html">423 U. S. 96</a>, 103 (1975) (citing <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 474), that he had not waived his right to remain silent, and that his inculpatory statements were involuntary.  The trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At trial, the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s theory was that Thompkins shot the victims from the passenger seat of a van driven by Eric Purifoy.  Purifoy testified that he had been driving the van and that Thompkins was in the passenger seat while another man, one Myzell Woodward, was in the back.  The defense strategy was to pin the blame on Purifoy.  Purifoy testified he did not see who fired the weapon because the van was stopped and he was bending over near the floor when shots were fired.  Purifoy explained that, just after the shooting, Thompkins, holding a pistol, told Purifoy, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat the hell you doing?  Pull off.\xe2\x80\x9d  Purifoy then drove away from the scene.  App. 170a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So that the Thompkins jury could assess Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s credibility and knowledge, the prosecution elicited testimony from Purifoy that he had been tried earlier for the shooting under an aiding-and-abetting theory.  Purifoy and Detective Helgert testified that a jury acquitted him of the murder and assault charges, convicted him of carrying a concealed weapon in a motor vehicle, and hung on two other firearms offenses to which he later pleaded guilty.  At Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the prosecution had argued that Purifoy was the driver and Thompkins was the shooter.  This was consistent with the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s argument at Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s trial.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial had ended\xe2\x80\x94but before Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s trial began\xe2\x80\x94Purifoy sent Thompkins some letters.  The letters expressed Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s disappointment that Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s family thought Purifoy was a \xe2\x80\x9csnitch\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9crat.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 179a\xe2\x80\x93180a.  In one letter Purifoy offered to send a copy of his trial transcript to Thompkins as proof that Purifoy did not place the blame on Thompkins for the shooting.  <em>Id.</em>, at 180a.  The letters also contained statements by Purifoy that claimed they were both innocent.  <em>Id.</em>, at 178a\xe2\x80\x93179a.  At Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the prosecution suggested that one of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s letters appeared to give Thompkins a trial strategy.  It was, the prosecution suggested, that Woodward shot the victims, allowing Purifoy and Thompkins to say they dropped to the floor when the shooting started.  <em>Id.</em>, at 187a\xe2\x80\x93189a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During closing arguments, the prosecution suggested that Purifoy lied when he testified that he did not see Thompkins shoot the victims:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDid Eric Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s Jury make the right decision?  I\xe2\x80\x99m not here to judge that.  You are not bound by what his Jury found.  Take his testimony for what it was, [a] twisted attempt to help not just an acquaintance but his tight buddy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 202a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nDefense counsel did not object.  Defense counsel also did not ask for an instruction informing the jury that it could consider evidence of the outcome of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial only to assess Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, not to establish Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found Thompkins guilty on all counts.  He was sentenced to life in prison without parole.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court denied a motion for new trial filed by Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s appellate counsel.  The trial court rejected the claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel for failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding the outcome of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial, reasoning that this did not prejudice Thompkins.  <em>Id.</em>, at 236a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins appealed this ruling, along with the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to suppress his pretrial statements under <em>Miranda</em>.  The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the <em>Miranda </em>claim, ruling that Thompkins had not invoked his right to remain silent and had waived it.  It also rejected the ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim, finding that Thompkins failed to show that evidence of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for firearms offenses resulted in prejudice.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 74a\xe2\x80\x9382a.  The Michigan Supreme Court denied discretionary review.  471 Mich. 866, 683 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 676 (2004) (table).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The District Court rejected Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 39a\xe2\x80\x9372a.  It noted that, under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court cannot grant a petition for a writ of habeas corpus unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the merits was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The District Court reasoned that Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and was not coerced into making statements during the interrogation.  It held further that the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in determining that Thompkins had waived his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed, ruling for Thompkins on both his <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims.  547 F.\xc2\xa03d 572 (2008).  The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court, in rejecting Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda </em>claim, unreasonably applied clearly established federal law and based its decision on an unreasonable determination of the facts.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that a waiver of the right to remain silent need not be express, as it can be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inferred from the actions and words of the person interrogated.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582 (quoting <em>North Carolina</em> v. <em>Butler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/369/index.html">441 U. S. 369</a>, 373 (1979)).  The panel held, nevertheless, that the state court was unreasonable in finding an implied waiver in the circumstances here.  The Court of Appeals found that the state court unreasonably determined the facts because \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence demonstrates that Thompkins was silent for two hours and forty-five minutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 586.  According to the Court of Appeals, Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersistent silence for nearly three hours in response to questioning and repeated invitations to tell his side of the story offered a clear and unequivocal message to the officers: Thompkins did not wish to waive his rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 588.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals next determined that the state court unreasonably applied clearly established federal law by rejecting Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim based on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to ask for a limiting instruction regarding Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal.  The Court of Appeals asserted that because Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s central strategy was to pin the blame on Purifoy, there was a reasonable probability that the result of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s trial would have been different if there had been a limiting instruction regarding Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s acquittal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  557 U.

See <em>Knowles</em> v. <em>Mirzayance</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 1).  The relevant state-court decision here is the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision affirming Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s conviction and rejecting his <em>Miranda </em>and ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claims on the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Miranda</em> Court formulated a warning that must be given to suspects before they can be subjected to custodial interrogation.  The substance of the warning still must be given to suspects today.  A suspect in custody must be advised as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cHe must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 479.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAll concede that the warning given in this case was in full compliance with these requirements.  The dispute centers on the response\xe2\x80\x94or nonresponse\xe2\x80\x94from the suspect.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins makes various arguments that his answers to questions from the detectives were inadmissible.  He first contends that he \xe2\x80\x9cinvoke[d] his privilege\xe2\x80\x9d to remain silent by not saying anything for a sufficient period of time, so the interrogation should have \xe2\x80\x9ccease[d]\xe2\x80\x9d before he made his inculpatory statements.  <em>Id.</em>, at 474; see <em>Mosley</em>, 423 U. S., at 103 (police must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scrupulously hono[r]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d this \xe2\x80\x9ccritical safeguard\xe2\x80\x9d when the accused invokes his or her \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right to cut off questioning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 474, 479)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is unpersuasive.  In the context of invoking the <em>Miranda </em>right to counsel, the Court in <em>Davis</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/452/index.html">512 U. S. 452</a>, 459 (1994), held that a suspect must do so \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguously.\xe2\x80\x9d  If an accused makes a statement concerning the right to counsel \xe2\x80\x9cthat is ambiguous or equivocal\xe2\x80\x9d or makes no statement, the police are not required to end the interrogation, <em>ibid.</em>, or ask questions to clarify whether the accused wants to invoke his or her <em>Miranda</em> rights, 512 U. S., at 461\xe2\x80\x93462.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has not yet stated whether an invocation of the right to remain silent can be ambiguous or equivocal, but there is no principled reason to adopt different standards for determining when an accused has invoked the <em>Miranda</em> right to remain silent and the <em>Miranda</em> right to counsel at issue in <em>Davis</em>.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Solem</em> v. <em>Stumes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/index.html">465 U. S. 638</a>, 648 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]uch of the logic and language of <em>[Mosley]</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d which discussed the <em>Miranda</em> right to remain silent, \xe2\x80\x9ccould be applied to the invocation of the [<em>Miranda</em> right to counsel]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Both protect the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 467\xe2\x80\x93473, by requiring an interrogation to cease when either right is invoked, <em>Mosley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103 (citing <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 474); <em>Fare</em> v. <em>Michael C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/707/index.html">442 U. S. 707</a>, 719 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is good reason to require an accused who wants to invoke his or her right to remain silent to do so unambiguously.  A requirement of an unambiguous invocation of <em>Miranda</em> rights results in an objective inquiry that \xe2\x80\x9cavoid[s] difficulties of proof and . . . provide[s] guidance to officers\xe2\x80\x9d on how to proceed in the face of ambiguity.  <em>Davis</em>, 512 U. S., at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  If an ambiguous act, omission, or statement could require police to end the interrogation, police would be required to make difficult decisions about an accused\xe2\x80\x99s unclear intent and face the consequence of suppression \xe2\x80\x9cif they guess wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 461.  Suppression of a voluntary confession in these circumstances would place a significant burden on society\xe2\x80\x99s interest in prosecuting criminal activity.  See <em>id.</em>, at 459\xe2\x80\x93461; <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 427 (1986).  Treating an ambiguous or equivocal act, omission, or statement as an invocation of <em>Miranda</em> rights \xe2\x80\x9cmight add marginally to <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s goal of dispelling the compulsion inherent in custodial interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burbine</em>, 475 U. S., at 425.  But \xe2\x80\x9cas <em>Miranda </em>holds, full comprehension of the rights to remain silent and request an attorney are sufficient to dispel whatever coercion is inherent in the interrogation process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 427; see <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 460.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins did not say that he wanted to remain silent or that he did not want to talk with the police.  Had he made either of these simple, unambiguous statements, he would have invoked his \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right to cut off questioning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mosley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 103 (quoting <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 474).  Here he did neither, so he did not invoke his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We next consider whether Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.  Even absent the accused\xe2\x80\x99s invocation of the right to remain silent, the accused\xe2\x80\x99s statement during a custodial interrogation is inadmissible at trial unless the prosecution can establish that the accused \xe2\x80\x9cin fact knowingly and voluntarily waived <em>[Miranda]</em> rights\xe2\x80\x9d when making the statement.  <em>Butler</em>, 441 U. S., at 373.  The waiver inquiry \xe2\x80\x9chas two distinct dimensions\xe2\x80\x9d: waiver must be \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation, coercion, or deception,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmade with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 421.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some language in <em>Miranda</em> could be read to indicate that waivers are difficult to establish absent an explicit written waiver or a formal, express oral statement.  <em>Miranda </em>said \xe2\x80\x9ca valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 475; see <em>id.</em>, at 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cNo effective waiver . . . can be recognized unless specifically made after the <em>[Miranda]</em> warnings . . . have been given\xe2\x80\x9d).  In addition, the <em>Miranda </em>Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9ca heavy burden rests on the government to demonstrate that the defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to retained or appointed counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 475.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The course of decisions since <em>Miranda</em>, informed by the application of <em>Miranda </em>warnings in the whole course of law enforcement, demonstrates that waivers can be established even absent formal or express statements of waiver that would be expected in, say, a judicial hearing to determine if a guilty plea has been properly entered.  Cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc.\xc2\xa011.  The main purpose of <em>Miranda</em> is to ensure that an accused is advised of and understands the right to remain silent and the right to counsel.  See <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 460; <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 427.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f anything, our subsequent cases have reduced the impact of the <em>Miranda </em>rule on legitimate law enforcement while reaffirming the decision\xe2\x80\x99s core ruling that unwarned statements may not be used as evidence in the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 443\xe2\x80\x93444 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the first cases to decide the meaning and import of <em>Miranda</em> with respect to the question of waiver was <em>North Carolina</em> v. <em>Butler</em>.  The <em>Butler</em> Court, after discussing some of the problems created by the language in <em>Miranda</em>, established certain important propositions.  <em>Butler</em> interpreted the <em>Miranda </em>language concerning the \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d to show waiver, 384 U. S., at 475, in accord with usual principles of determining waiver, which can include waiver implied from all the circumstances.  See <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373, 376.  And in a later case, the Court stated that this \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d is not more than the burden to establish waiver by a preponderance of the evidence.  <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Connelly</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/157/index.html">479 U. S. 157</a>, 168 (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecution therefore does not need to show that a waiver of <em>Miranda </em>rights was express.  An \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit waiver\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cright to remain silent\xe2\x80\x9d is sufficient to admit a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s statement into evidence.  <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 376.  <em>Butler</em> made clear that a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights may be implied through \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U. S., at 373.  The Court in <em>Butler </em>therefore \xe2\x80\x9cretreated\xe2\x80\x9d from the \xe2\x80\x9clanguage and tenor of the <em>Miranda</em> opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9csuggested that the Court would require that a waiver . . . be \xe2\x80\x98specifically made.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Connecticut</em> v. <em>Barrett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/523/index.html">479 U. S. 523</a>, 531\xe2\x80\x93532 (1987) (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment).   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the State establishes that a <em>Miranda</em> warning was given and the accused made an uncoerced statement, this showing, standing alone, is insufficient to demonstrate \xe2\x80\x9ca valid waiver\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Miranda </em>rights.  <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 475.  The prosecution must make the additional showing that the accused understood these rights.  See <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Spring</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/564/index.html">479 U. S. 564</a>, 573\xe2\x80\x93575 (1987); <em>Barrett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 530; <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 421\xe2\x80\x93422.  Cf. <em>Tague</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/469/index.html">444 U. S. 469</a>, 469, 471 (1980) <em>(per curiam) </em>(no evidence that accused understood his <em>Miranda</em> rights); <em>Carnley</em> v. <em>Cochran</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/506/index.html">369 U. S. 506</a>, 516 (1962) (government could not show that accused \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandingly\xe2\x80\x9d waived his right to counsel in light of \xe2\x80\x9csilent record\xe2\x80\x9d).  Where the prosecution shows that a <em>Miranda </em>warning was given and that it was understood by the accused, an accused\xe2\x80\x99s uncoerced statement establishes an implied waiver of the right to remain silent. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Miranda</em> imposes on the police a rule that is both formalistic and practical when it prevents them from interrogating suspects without first providing them with a <em>Miranda</em> warning, see <em>Burbine</em>, 475 U. S., at 427, it does not impose a formalistic waiver procedure that a suspect must follow to relinquish those rights.  As a general proposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 372\xe2\x80\x93376; <em>Connelly</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 169\xe2\x80\x93170 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is obviously no reason to require more in the way of a \xe2\x80\x98voluntariness\xe2\x80\x99 inquiry in the <em>Miranda </em>waiver context than in the [due process] confession context\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases have recognized that a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights need only meet the standard of <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Zerbst</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/458/index.html">304 U. S. 458</a>, 464 (1938).  See <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 374\xe2\x80\x93375; <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 475\xe2\x80\x93476 (applying <em>Zerbst </em>standard of intentional relinquishment of a known right).  As <em>Butler</em> recognized, 441 U. S., at 375\xe2\x80\x93376, <em>Miranda </em>rights can therefore be waived through means less formal than a typical waiver on the record in a courtroom, cf. Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11, given the practical constraints and necessities of interrogation and the fact that <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s main protection lies in advising defendants of their rights, see <em>Davis</em>, 512 U. S., at 460; <em>Burbine</em>, 475 U. S., at 427.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record in this case shows that Thompkins waived his right to remain silent.  There is no basis in this case to conclude that he did not understand his rights; and on these facts it follows that he chose not to invoke or rely on those rights when he did speak.  First, there is no contention that Thompkins did not understand his rights; and from this it follows that he knew what he gave up when he spoke.  See <em>id.</em>, at 421.  There was more than enough evidence in the record to conclude that Thompkins understood his <em>Miranda</em> rights.  Thompkins received a written copy of the <em>Miranda </em>warnings; Detective Helgert determined that Thompkins could read and understand English; and Thompkins was given time to read the warnings.  Thompkins, furthermore, read aloud the fifth warning, which stated that \xe2\x80\x9cyou have the right to decide at any time before or during questioning to use your right to remain silent and your right to talk with a lawyer while you are being questioned.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 60 (capitalization omitted).  He was thus aware that his right to remain silent would not dissipate after a certain amount of time and that police would have to honor his right to be silent and his right to counsel during the whole course of interrogation.  Those rights, the warning made clear, could be asserted at any time.  Helgert, moreover, read the warnings aloud.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Detective Helgert\xe2\x80\x99s question about whether Thompkins prayed to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim is a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\xe2\x80\x9d of the right to remain silent.  <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373.  If Thompkins wanted to remain silent, he could have said nothing in response to Helgert\xe2\x80\x99s questions, or he could have unambiguously invoked his <em>Miranda</em> rights and ended the interrogation.  The fact that Thompkins made a statement about three hours after receiving a <em>Miranda</em> warning does not overcome the fact that he engaged in a course of conduct indicating waiver.  Police are not required to rewarn suspects from time to time.  Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s answer to Helgert\xe2\x80\x99s question about praying to God for forgiveness for shooting the victim was sufficient to show a course of conduct indicating waiver.  This is confirmed by the fact that before then Thompkins\nhad given sporadic answers to questions throughout the interrogation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, there is no evidence that Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s statement was coerced.  See <em>Burbine</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 421.  Thompkins does not claim that police threatened or injured him during the interrogation or that he was in any way fearful.  The interrogation was conducted in a standard-sized room in the middle of the afternoon.  It is true that apparently he was in a straight-backed chair for three hours, but there is no authority for the proposition that an interrogation of this length is inherently coercive.  Indeed, even where interrogations of greater duration were held to be improper, they were accompanied, as this one was not, by other facts indicating coercion, such as an incapacitated and sedated suspect, sleep and food deprivation, and threats.  Cf. <em>Connelly</em>, 479 U. S., at 163\xe2\x80\x93164, n.\xc2\xa01.  The fact that Helgert\xe2\x80\x99s question referred to Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs also did not render Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s statement involuntary.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Fifth Amendment privilege is not concerned \xe2\x80\x98with moral and psychological pressures to confess emanating from sources other than official coercion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 170 (quoting <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Elstad</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/298/index.html">470 U. S. 298</a>, 305 (1985)).  In these circumstances, Thompkins knowingly and voluntarily made a statement to police, so he waived his right to remain silent.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins next argues that, even if his answer to Detective Helgert could constitute a waiver of his right to remain silent, the police were not allowed to question him until they obtained a waiver first.  <em>Butler</em> forecloses this argument.  The <em>Butler </em>Court held that courts can infer a waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the actions and words of the person interrogated.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U. S., at 373.  This principle would be inconsistent with a rule that requires a waiver at the outset.  The <em>Butler</em> Court thus rejected the rule proposed by the <em>Butler</em> dissent, which would have \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ed] the police to obtain an express waiver of [<em>Miranda</em> rights] before proceeding with interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 379 (Brennan, J., dissenting).  This holding also makes sense given that \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary protection afforded suspects subject[ed] to custodial interrogation is the <em>Miranda </em>warnings themselves.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, 512 U. S., at 460.  The <em>Miranda</em> rule and its requirements are met if a suspect receives adequate <em>Miranda</em> warnings, understands them, and has an opportunity to invoke the rights before giving any answers or admissions.  Any waiver, express or implied, may be contradicted by an invocation at any time.  If the right to counsel or the right to remain silent is invoked at any point during questioning, further interrogation must cease.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interrogation provides the suspect with additional information that can put his or her decision to waive, or not to invoke, into perspective.  As questioning commences and then continues, the suspect has the opportunity to consider the choices he or she faces and to make a more informed decision, either to insist on silence or to cooperate.  When the suspect knows that <em>Miranda</em> rights can be invoked at any time, he or she has the opportunity to reassess his or her immediate and long-term interests.  Cooperation with the police may result in more favorable treatment for the suspect; the apprehension of accomplices; the prevention of continuing injury and fear; beginning steps towards relief or solace for the victims; and the beginning of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s own return to the law and the social order it seeks to protect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order for an accused\xe2\x80\x99s statement to be admissible at trial, police must have given the accused a <em>Miranda</em> warning.  See <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U. S., at 471.  If that condition is established, the court can proceed to consider whether there has been an express or implied waiver of <em>Miranda</em> rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 476.  In making its ruling on the admissibility of a statement made during custodial questioning, the trial court, of course, considers whether there is evidence to support the conclusion that, from the whole course of questioning, an express or implied waiver has been established.  Thus, after giving a <em>Miranda</em> warning, police may interrogate a suspect who has neither invoked nor waived his or her <em>Miranda</em> rights.  On these premises, it fol-\nlows the police were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda</em> rights before commencing the\ninterrogation.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, a suspect who has received and understood the <em>Miranda</em> warnings, and has not invoked his <em>Miranda</em> rights, waives the right to remain silent by making an uncoerced statement to the police.  Thompkins did not invoke his right to remain silent and stop the questioning.  Understanding his rights in full, he waived his right to remain silent by making a voluntary statement to the police.  The police, moreover, were not required to obtain a waiver of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s right to remain silent before interrogating him.  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rejecting Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Miranda </em>claim was thus correct under <em>de novo</em> review and therefore necessarily reasonable under the more deferential AEDPA standard of review, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  See <em>Knowles</em>, 556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11) (state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was correct under <em>de novo </em>review and not unreasonable under AEDPA).  </p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second issue in this case is whether Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s counsel provided ineffective assistance by failing to request a limiting instruction regarding how the jury could consider the outcome of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  To establish ineffective assistance of counsel, a defendant \xe2\x80\x9cmust show both deficient performance and prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 10) (citing <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 687).  To establish prejudice, a \xe2\x80\x9cdefendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 694.  In assessing prejudice, courts \xe2\x80\x9cmust consider the totality of the evidence before the judge or jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 695.  The Court of Appeals, however, neglected to take into account the other evidence presented against Thompkins.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals determined that the state court was unreasonable, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), when it found that Thompkins suffered no prejudice from failure of defense counsel to request an instruction regarding Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s earlier acquittal of the murder and assault charges.  The state court had rejected Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he was prejudiced by evidence of Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s earlier conviction for firearms offenses, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record does not disclose an attempt to argue that conviction for an improper purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 80a.  It is unclear what prejudice standard the state court applied.  The Court of Appeals ruled that the state court used the incorrect standard for assessing prejudice under <em>Strickland</em> because \xe2\x80\x9c[q]uestions of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s purpose or intent are completely irrelevant in analyzing whether an error resulted in prejudice, which by definition concerns the error\xe2\x80\x99s effect upon the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 591\xe2\x80\x93592 (emphasis deleted).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the state court used an incorrect legal standard, we need not determine whether AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), applies in this situation.  Cf. <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 397\xe2\x80\x93398 (2000).  That is because, even if AEDPA deference does not apply, Thompkins cannot show prejudice under <em>de novo </em>review, the more favorable standard of review for Thompkins.  Courts cannot grant writs of habeas corpus under \xc2\xa72254 by engaging only in <em>de novo</em> review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, \xc2\xa72254(d).  In those situations, courts must resolve whether AEDPA deference applies, because if it does, a habeas petitioner may not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus under \xc2\xa72254(d).  Courts can, however, deny writs of habeas corpus under \xc2\xa72254 by engaging in <em>de novo</em> review when it is unclear whether AEDPA deference applies, because a habeas petitioner will not be entitled to a writ of habeas corpus if his or her claim is rejected on <em>de novo</em> review, see \xc2\xa72254(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems doubtful that failure to request the instruction about the earlier acquittal or conviction was deficient representation; but on the assumption that it was, on this record Thompkins cannot show prejudice.  The record establishes that it was not reasonably likely that the instruction would have made any difference in light of all the other evidence of guilt.  The surviving victim, Frederick France, identified Thompkins as the shooter, and the identification was supported by a photograph taken from a surveillance camera.  Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s friend Omar Stephens testified that Thompkins confessed to him during a phone conversation, and the details of that confession were corroborated by evidence that Thompkins stripped the van and abandoned it after the shooting.  The jury, moreover, was capable of assessing Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s credibility, as it was instructed to do.  The jury in Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s case could have concluded that the earlier jury in Purifoy\xe2\x80\x99s case made a mistake, or alternatively, that Purifoy was not in fact guilty of the crime for which he had been charged.  There was ample evidence in the record to support Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99s guilt under either theory, and his jury was instructed to weigh all of the evidence in determining whether there was guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Under our <em>de novo</em> review of this record, Thompkins cannot show prejudice.  </p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed,\nand the case is remanded with instructions to deny the petition.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963277">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOTOMAYOR, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBERGHUIS V.

The Court also concludes that a suspect who wishes to guard his right to remain silent against such a finding of \xe2\x80\x9cwaiver\xe2\x80\x9d must, counterintuitively, speak\xe2\x80\x94and must do so with sufficient precision to satisfy a clear-statement rule that construes ambiguity in favor of the police.  Both propositions mark a substantial retreat from the protection against compelled self-incrimination that <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), has long provided during custodial interrogation.  The broad rules the Court announces today are also troubling because they are unnecessary to decide this case, which is governed by the deferential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).  Because I believe Thompkins is entitled to relief under AEDPA on the ground that his statements were admitted at trial without the prosecution having carried its burden to show that he waived his right to remain silent; because longstanding principles of judicial restraint counsel leaving for another day the questions of law the Court reaches out to decide; and because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s answers to those questions do not result from a faithful application of our prior decisions, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari to review the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, which held that Thompkins was entitled to habeas relief under both <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  547 F.\xc2\xa03d 572 (2008).  As to the <em>Miranda </em>claims, Thompkins argues first that through his conduct during the 3-hour custodial interrogation he effectively invoked his right to remain silent, requiring police to cut off questioning in accordance with <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Mosley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/index.html">423 U. S. 96</a> (1975).  Thompkins also contends his statements were in any case inadmissible because the prosecution failed to meet its heavy burden under <em>Miranda</em> of proving that he knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent.  The Sixth Circuit agreed with Thompkins as to waiver and declined to reach the question of invocation.  547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583\xe2\x80\x93584, n.\xc2\xa04.  In my view, even if Thompkins cannot prevail on his invocation claim under AEDPA, he is entitled to relief as to waiver.  Because I would affirm the judgment of the Sixth Circuit on that ground, I would not reach Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 claim that he received constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strength of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Miranda </em>claims depends in large part on the circumstances of the 3-hour interrogation, at the end of which he made inculpatory statements later introduced at trial.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion downplays record evidence that Thompkins remained almost completely silent and unresponsive throughout that session.  One of the interrogating officers, Detective Helgert, testified that although Thompkins was administered <em>Miranda </em>warnings, the last of which he read aloud, Thompkins expressly declined to sign a written acknowledgment that he had been advised of and understood his rights.  There is conflicting evidence in the record about whether Thompkins ever verbally confirmed understanding his rights.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The record contains no indication that the officers sought or obtained an express waiver.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the interrogation itself, Helgert candidly characterized it as \xe2\x80\x9cvery, very one-sided\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cnearly a monologue.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 10a, 17a.  Thompkins was \xe2\x80\x9c[p]eculiar,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ullen,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[g]enerally quiet.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 149a.  Helgert and his partner \xe2\x80\x9cdid most of the talking,\xe2\x80\x9d as Thompkins was \xe2\x80\x9cnot verbally communicative\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[l]argely\xe2\x80\x9d remained silent.  <em>Id.,</em> at 149a, 17a, 19a.  To the extent Thompkins gave any response, his answers consisted of \xe2\x80\x9ca word or two.  A \xe2\x80\x98yeah,\xe2\x80\x99 or a \xe2\x80\x98no,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98I don\xe2\x80\x99t know.\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 And sometimes \xe2\x80\xa6 he simply sat down \xe2\x80\xa6 with [his] head in [his] hands looking down.  Sometimes \xe2\x80\xa6 he would look up and make eye-contact would be the only response.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 23a\xe2\x80\x9324a.  After proceeding in this fashion for approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes, Helgert asked Thompkins three questions relating to his faith in God.  The prosecution relied at trial on Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 one-word answers of \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id.,</em> at 10a\xe2\x80\x9311a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 nonresponsiveness is particularly striking in the context of the officers\xe2\x80\x99 interview strategy, later explained as conveying to Thompkins that \xe2\x80\x9cthis was his opportunity to explain his side [of the story]\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[e]verybody else, including [his] co-[d]efendants, had given their version,\xe2\x80\x9d and asking him \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ho is going to speak up for you if you don\xe2\x80\x99t speak up for yourself?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 10a, 21a.  Yet, Helgert confirmed that the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>only</em> thing [Thompkins said] relative to his involvement [in the shooting]\xe2\x80\x9d occurred near the end of the interview\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, in response to the questions about God.  <em>Id.,</em> at 10a\xe2\x80\x9311a (emphasis added).  The only other responses Helgert could remember Thompkins giving were that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[h]e didn\xe2\x80\x99t want a peppermint\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the chair that he was sitting in was hard.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 152a.  Nevertheless, the Michigan court concluded on this record that Thompkins had not invoked his right to remain silent because \xe2\x80\x9che continued to talk with the officer, albeit sporadically,\xe2\x80\x9d and that he voluntarily waived that right.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 federal habeas petition is governed by AEDPA, under which a federal court may not grant the writ unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the merits of the claim at issue \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1), (2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant clearly established federal law for purposes of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) begins with our landmark <em>Miranda</em> decision, which \xe2\x80\x9cg[a]ve force to the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s protection against compelled self-incrimination\xe2\x80\x9d by establishing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98certain procedural safeguards that require police to advise criminal suspects of their rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments before commencing custodial interrogation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Florida</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, 559 U.

S., at 479; <em>ante</em>, at 8.  <em>Miranda</em> and our subsequent cases also require police to \xe2\x80\x9crespect the accused\xe2\x80\x99s decision to exercise the rights outlined in the warnings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U.

A suspect may at any time revoke his prior waiver of rights\xe2\x80\x94or, closer to the facts of this case, guard against the possibility of a future finding that he implicitly waived his rights\xe2\x80\x94by invoking the rights and thereby requiring the police to cease questioning.

Since the State is responsible for establishing the isolated circumstances under which [an] interrogation takes place and has the only means of making available corroborated evidence of warnings given during incommunicado interrogation, the burden is rightly on its shoulders.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAn express statement that the individual is willing to make a statement and does not want an attorney followed closely by a statement could constitute a waiver.  But a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from the silence of the accused after warnings are given or simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 475.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Miranda </em>went further in describing the facts likely\nto satisfy the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden of establishing the ad-missibility of statements obtained after a lengthy\ninterrogation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWhatever the testimony of the authorities as to waiver of rights by an accused, the fact of lengthy interrogation or incommunicado incarceration before a statement is made is strong evidence that the accused did not validly waive his rights.  In these circumstances the fact that the individual eventually made a statement is consistent with the conclusion that the compelling influence of the interrogation finally forced him to do so.  It is inconsistent with any notion of a voluntary relinquishment of the privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 476.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions subsequent to <em>Miranda</em> have emphasized the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d in proving waiver.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Tague</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/444/469/index.html">444 U.

We have also reaffirmed that a court may not presume waiver from a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s silence or from the mere fact that a confession was eventually obtained.  See <em>North Carolina</em> v. <em>Butler</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/369/index.html">441 U.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation had obtained statements after advising Butler of his rights and confirming that he understood them.  When presented with a written waiver-of-rights form, Butler told the agents, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I will talk to you but I am not signing any form.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U.

He then made inculpatory statements, which he later sought to suppress on the ground that he had not expressly waived his right to counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although this Court reversed the state-court judgment concluding that the statements were inadmissible, we quoted at length portions of the <em>Miranda</em> opinion reproduced above.  We cautioned that even an \xe2\x80\x9cexpress written or oral statement of waiver of the right to remain silent or of the right to counsel\xe2\x80\x9d is not \xe2\x80\x9cinevitably \xe2\x80\xa6 sufficient to establish waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question is \xe2\x80\xa6 whether the defendant in fact knowingly and voluntarily waived the rights delineated in the <em>Miranda </em>case.\xe2\x80\x9d  441 U.

While we stopped short in <em>Butler </em>of announcing a <em>per se </em>rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s silence, coupled with an understanding of his rights and a course of conduct indicating waiver, may never support a conclusion that a defendant has waived his rights,\xe2\x80\x9d we reiterated that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must presume that a defendant did not waive his rights; the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden is great.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rarely do this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents provide clearly established law so closely on point with the facts of a particular case.

His refusal to sign even an acknowledgment that he understood his <em>Miranda </em>rights evinces, if anything, an intent not to waive those rights.  Cf. <em>United States </em>v. <em>Plugh</em>, 576 F.\xc2\xa03d 135, 142 (CA2 2009) (suspect\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to sign waiver-of-rights form \xe2\x80\x9cconstituted an unequivocally negative answer to the question \xe2\x80\xa6 whether he was willing to waive his rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  That Thompkins did not make the inculpatory statements at issue until after approximately 2 hours and 45 minutes of interrogation serves as \xe2\x80\x9cstrong evidence\xe2\x80\x9d against waiver.  <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Butler</em> expressly preclude the possibility that the inculpatory statements themselves are sufficient to establish waiver.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these circumstances, Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cactions and words\xe2\x80\x9d preceding the inculpatory statements simply do not evidence a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of conduct indicating waiver\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient to carry the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden.  See <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 373.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Although the Michigan court stated that Thompkins \xe2\x80\x9csporadically\xe2\x80\x9d participated in the interview, App. to Pet. for Cert. 75a, that court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion and the record before us are silent as to the subject matter or context of even a single question to which Thompkins purportedly responded, other than the exchange about God and the statements respecting the peppermint and the chair.  Unlike in <em>Butler</em>, Thompkins made no initial declaration akin to \xe2\x80\x9cI will talk to you.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also 547 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 586\xe2\x80\x93587 (case below) (noting that the case might be different if the record showed Thompkins had responded affirmatively to an invitation to tell his side of the story or described any particular question that Thompkins answered).  Indeed, Michigan and the United States concede that no waiver occurred in this case until Thompkins responded \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to the questions about God.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 7, 30.  I believe it is objectively unreasonable under our clearly established precedents to conclude the prosecution met its \xe2\x80\x9cheavy burden\xe2\x80\x9d of proof on a record consisting of three one-word answers, following 2 hours and 45 minutes of silence punctuated by a few largely nonverbal responses to unidentified questions.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps because our prior <em>Miranda </em>precedents so clearly favor Thompkins, the Court today goes beyond AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review and announces a new general principle of law.  Any new rule, it must be emphasized, is unnecessary to the disposition of this case.  If, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Michigan court did not unreasonably apply our <em>Miranda </em>precedents in denying Thompkins relief, it should simply say so and reverse the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on that ground.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a fundamental rule of judicial restraint \xe2\x80\xa6 that this Court will not reach constitutional questions in advance of the necessity of deciding them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Three Affiliated Tribes of Fort Berthold Reservation</em> v. <em>Wold Engineering, P.\xc2\xa0C.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/138/index.html">467 U.

More broadly still, the Court states that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s a general proposition, the law can presume that an individual who, with a full understanding of his or her rights, acts in a manner inconsistent with their exercise has made a deliberate choice to relinquish the protection those rights afford.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These principles flatly contradict our longstanding views that \xe2\x80\x9ca valid waiver will not be presumed \xe2\x80\xa6 simply from the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miranda</em>, 384 U.

Indeed, we have in the past summarily reversed a state-court decision that inverted <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s antiwaiver presumption, characterizing the error as \xe2\x80\x9creadily apparent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tague</em>, 444 U.

At best, the Court today creates an unworkable and conflicting set of presumptions that will undermine <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s goal of providing \xe2\x80\x9cconcrete constitutional guidelines for law enforcement agencies and courts to follow,\xe2\x80\x9d 384 U. S., at 442.  At worst, it overrules <em>sub silentio</em> an essential aspect of the protections <em>Miranda </em>has long provided for the constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 inculpatory statements were sufficient to establish an implied waiver, <em>ante</em>, at 14, finds no support in <em>Butler</em>.  <em>Butler </em>itself distinguished between a sufficient \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of conduct\xe2\x80\x9d and inculpatory statements, reiterating <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s admonition that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a valid waiver will not be presumed simply from \xe2\x80\xa6 the fact that a confession was in fact eventually obtained.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Butler</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 373 (quoting <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 475).  Michigan suggests Butler\xe2\x80\x99s silence \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when advised of his right to the assistance of a lawyer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d combined with our remand for the state court to apply the implied-waiver standard, shows that silence followed by statements can be a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98course of conduct.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 26 (quoting <em>Butler</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 371).  But the evidence of implied waiver in <em>Butler </em>was worlds apart from the evidence in this case, because Butler unequivocally said \xe2\x80\x9cI will talk to you\xe2\x80\x9d after<em> </em>having been read <em>Miranda </em>warnings.  Thompkins, of course, made no such statement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also relies heavily on <em>Burbine</em> in characterizing the scope of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden in proving waiver.  Consistent with <em>Burbine</em>, the Court observes, the prosecution must prove that waiver was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98voluntary in the sense that it was the product of a free and deliberate choice rather than intimidation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98made with a full awareness of both the nature of the right being abandoned and the consequences of the decision to abandon it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10 (quoting 475 U. S., at 421).  I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement, so far as it goes.  What it omits, however, is that the prosecution also bears an antecedent burden of showing there was, in fact, either an express waiver or a \xe2\x80\x9ccourse of conduct\xe2\x80\x9d sufficiently clear to support a finding of implied waiver.  Nothing in <em>Burbine </em>even hints at removing that obligation.  The question in that case, rather,<em> </em>was whether a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s multiple express waivers of his rights were invalid because police \xe2\x80\x9cmisinformed an inquiring attorney about their plans concerning the suspect or because they failed to inform the suspect of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to reach him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 420; see also <em>Colorado</em> v. <em>Spring</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/564/index.html">479 U. S. 564</a>, 573 (1987).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in <em>Burbine</em> was predicated on the existence of waiver-in-fact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s dilution of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof to the bare fact that a suspect made inculpatory statements after <em>Miranda </em>warnings were given and understood takes an unprecedented step away from the \xe2\x80\x9chigh standards of proof for the waiver of constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has long demanded.  <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 475; cf. <em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/index.html">430 U. S. 387</a>, 404 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts indulge in every reasonable presumption against waiver\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Zerbst</em>, 304 U. S., at 464.  When waiver is to be inferred during a custodial interrogation, there are sound reasons to require evidence beyond inculpatory statements themselves.  <em>Miranda </em>and our subsequent cases are premised on the idea that custodial interrogation is inherently coercive.  See 384 U. S., at 455 (\xe2\x80\x9cEven without employing brutality, the \xe2\x80\x98third degree\xe2\x80\x99 or [other] specific strategems \xe2\x80\xa6 the very fact of custodial interrogation exacts a heavy toll on individual liberty and trades on the weakness of individuals\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Dickerson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/428/index.html">530 U. S. 428</a>, 435 (2000).  Requiring proof of a course of conduct beyond the inculpatory statements themselves is critical to ensuring that those statements are voluntary admissions and not the dubious product of an overborne will.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision thus ignores the important interests <em>Miranda </em>safeguards.  The underlying constitutional guarantee against self-incrimination reflects \xe2\x80\x9cmany of our fundamental values and most noble aspirations,\xe2\x80\x9d our society\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpreference for an accusatorial rather than an inquisitorial system of criminal justice\xe2\x80\x9d; a \xe2\x80\x9cfear that self-incriminating statements will be elicited by inhumane treatment and abuses\xe2\x80\x9d and a resulting \xe2\x80\x9cdistrust of self-deprecatory statements\xe2\x80\x9d; and a realization that while the privilege is \xe2\x80\x9csometimes a shelter to the guilty, [it] is often a protection to the innocent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Withrow</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/index.html">507 U.

For these reasons, we have observed, a criminal law system \xe2\x80\x9cwhich comes to depend on the \xe2\x80\x98confession\xe2\x80\x99 will, in the long run, be less reliable and more subject to abuses than a system relying on independent investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (some internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy bracing against \xe2\x80\x98the possibility of unreliable statements in every instance of in-custody interrogation,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s prophylactic rules<em> </em>serve to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98protect the fairness of the trial itself.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  507 U.

Like the Sixth Circuit, I would not reach this question because Thompkins is in any case entitled to relief as to waiver.  But even if Thompkins would not prevail on his invocation claim under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review, I cannot agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s much broader ruling that a suspect must clearly invoke his right to silence by speaking.  Taken together with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reformulation of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s burden of proof as to waiver, today\xe2\x80\x99s novel clear-statement rule for invocation invites police to question a suspect at length\xe2\x80\x94notwithstanding his persistent refusal to answer questions\xe2\x80\x94in the hope of eventually obtaining a single inculpatory response which will suffice to prove waiver of rights.  Such a result bears little semblance to the \xe2\x80\x9cfully effective\xe2\x80\x9d prophylaxis, 384 U. S., at 444, that <em>Miranda</em> requires.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 claim for relief under AEDPA rests on the clearly established federal law of <em>Miranda </em>and <em>Mosley</em>.  In <em>Miranda</em>, the Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f [an] individual indicates in any manner, at any time prior to or during questioning, that he wishes to remain silent, the interrogation must cease\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [A]ny statement taken after the person invokes his privilege cannot be other than the product of compulsion, subtle or otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 473\xe2\x80\x93474.  In <em>Mosley</em>, the Court said that a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical safeguard\xe2\x80\x9d of the right to remain silent is a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right to cut off questioning.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  423 U. S., at 103 (quoting <em>Miranda</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 474).  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cthe admissibility of statements obtained after the person in custody has decided to remain silent depends under <em>Miranda </em>on whether his \xe2\x80\x98right to cut off questioning\xe2\x80\x99 was \xe2\x80\x98scrupulously honored.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  423 U.

In Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s view, Thompkins cannot prevail under AEDPA because this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents have not previously established whether a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous statements or actions require the police to stop questioning.  We have held that a suspect who has \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98invoked his right to have counsel present \xe2\x80\xa6 is not subject to further interrogation by the authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless [he] initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with the police.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Maryland</em> v. <em>Shatzer</em>, 559 U.

Notwithstanding <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no questioning\xe2\x80\x9d if a suspect \xe2\x80\x9cindicates in any manner \xe2\x80\xa6 that he wishes to consult with an attorney,\xe2\x80\x9d 384 U.

S. 452</a>, 461 (1994) established a clear-statement rule for invoking the right to counsel.  After a suspect has knowingly and voluntarily waived his <em>Miranda</em> rights, <em>Davis </em>held, police may continue questioning \xe2\x80\x9cuntil and unless the suspect <em>clearly</em> requests an attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U.

That the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was not objectively unreasonable is confirmed, in Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s view, by the number of federal Courts of Appeals to have applied <em>Davis</em> to invocation of the right to silence.  Brief for Petitioner 44.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review, it is indeed difficult to conclude that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of our precedents was objectively unreasonable.  Although the duration and consistency of Thompkins\xe2\x80\x99 refusal to answer questions throughout the 3-hour interrogation provide substantial evidence in support of his claim, Thompkins did not remain absolutely silent, and this Court has not previously addressed whether a suspect can invoke the right to silence by remaining uncooperative and nearly silent for 2 hours and 45 minutes.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court, however, eschews this narrow ground of decision, instead extending <em>Davis </em>to hold that police may continue questioning a suspect until he unambiguously invokes his right to remain silent.  Because Thompkins neither said \xe2\x80\x9che wanted to remain silent\xe2\x80\x9d nor said \xe2\x80\x9che did not want to talk with the police,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concludes, he did not clearly invoke his right to silence.  <em>Ante,</em> at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I disagree with this novel application of <em>Davis</em>.  Neither the rationale nor holding of that case compels today\xe2\x80\x99s result.  <em>Davis </em>involved the right to counsel, not the right to silence.  The Court in <em>Davis </em>reasoned that extending <em>Edwards</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9crigid\xe2\x80\x9d prophylactic rule to ambiguous requests for a lawyer would transform <em>Miranda</em> into a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wholly irrational obstacl[e] to legitimate police investigative activity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cneedlessly prevent[ing] the police from questioning a suspect in the absence of counsel even if [he] did not wish to have a lawyer present.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Davis</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 460.  But <em>Miranda</em> itself \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguished between the procedural safeguards triggered by a request to remain silent and a request for an attorney.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mosley</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 104, n.\xc2\xa010; accord, <em>Edwards</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 485.  <em>Mosley</em> upheld the admission of statements when police immediately stopped interrogating a suspect who invoked his right to silence, but reapproached him after a 2-hour delay and obtained inculpatory responses relating to a different crime after administering fresh <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  The different effects of invoking the rights are consistent with distinct standards for invocation.  To the extent <em>Mosley</em> contemplates a more flexible form of prophylaxis than <em>Edwards</em>\xe2\x80\x94and, in particular, does not categorically bar police from reapproaching a suspect who has invoked his right to remain silent\xe2\x80\x94<em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x99 concern about \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wholly irrational obstacles\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to police investigation applies with less force.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s equivocal reference to a lawyer in <em>Davis </em>occurred only <em>after</em> he had given express oral and written waivers of his rights.  <em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x99 holding is explicitly predicated on that fact.  See 512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 461 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe therefore hold that, after a knowing and voluntary waiver of the <em>Miranda</em> rights, law enforcement officers may continue questioning until and unless the suspect clearly requests an attorney\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court ignores this aspect of <em>Davis</em>, as well as the decisions of numerous federal and state courts declining to apply a clear-statement rule when a suspect has not previously given an express waiver of rights.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my mind, a more appropriate standard for addressing a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous invocation of the right to remain silent is the constraint <em>Mosley</em> places on questioning a suspect who has invoked that right: The suspect\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98right to cut off questioning\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d must be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98scrupulously honored.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See 423 U. S., at 104.  Such a standard is necessarily precautionary and fact specific.  The rule would acknowledge that some statements or conduct are so equivocal that police may scrupulously honor a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights without terminating questioning\xe2\x80\x94for instance, if a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s actions are reasonably understood to indicate a willingness to listen before deciding whether to respond.  But other statements or actions\xe2\x80\x94in particular, when a suspect sits silent throughout prolonged interrogation, long past the point when he could be deciding whether to respond\xe2\x80\x94cannot reasonably be understood other than as an invocation of the right to remain silent.  Under such circumstances, \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulous\xe2\x80\x9d respect for the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s rights will require police to terminate questioning under <em>Mosley</em>.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, such a standard does not provide police with a bright-line rule.  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But, as we have previously recognized, <em>Mosley </em>itself does not offer clear guidance to police about when and how interrogation may continue after a suspect invokes his rights.  See <em>Solem</em> v. <em>Stumes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/index.html">465 U. S. 638</a>, 648 (1984); see also <em>Shatzer</em>, 559 U. S., at ___ (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 3).  Given that police have for nearly 35 years applied <em>Mosley</em>\xe2\x80\x99s fact-specific standard in questioning suspects who have invoked their right to remain silent; that our cases did not during that time resolve what statements or actions suffice to invoke that right; and that neither Michigan nor the Solicitor General have provided evidence in this case that the status quo<em> </em>has proved unworkable, I see little reason to believe today\xe2\x80\x99s clear-statement rule is necessary to ensure effective law enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x99 clear-statement rule is also a poor fit for the right to silence.  Advising a suspect that he has a \xe2\x80\x9cright to remain silent\xe2\x80\x9d is unlikely to convey that he must speak (and must do so in some particular fashion) to ensure the right will be protected.  Cf. <em>Soffar</em> v. <em>Cockrell</em>, 300 F. 3d 588, 603 (CA5 2002) (en banc) (DeMoss, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat in the world must an individual do to exercise his constitutional right to remain silent beyond actually, in fact, remaining silent?\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, telling a suspect \xe2\x80\x9che has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Miranda</em>,<em> </em>384 U. S., at 479, implies the need for speech to exercise that right.  <em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x99<em> </em>requirement that a suspect must \xe2\x80\x9cclearly reques[t] an attorney\xe2\x80\x9d to terminate questioning thus aligns with a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s likely understanding of the <em>Miranda</em> warnings in a way today\xe2\x80\x99s rule does not.  The Court suggests Thompkins could have employed the \xe2\x80\x9csimple, unambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d means of saying \xe2\x80\x9che wanted to remain silent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdid not want to talk with the police.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  But the <em>Miranda </em>warnings give no hint that a suspect should use those magic words, and there is little reason to believe police\xe2\x80\x94who have ample incentives to avoid invocation\xe2\x80\x94will provide such guidance.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Conversely, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern that police will face \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult decisions about an accused\xe2\x80\x99s unclear intent\xe2\x80\x9d and suffer the consequences of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98guess[ing] wrong,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 9\xe2\x80\x9310 (quoting <em>Davis</em>, 512 U. S., at 461), is misplaced.  If a suspect makes an ambiguous statement or engages in conduct that creates uncertainty about his intent to invoke his right, police can simply ask for clarification.  See <em>id.</em>, at 467 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment).  It is hardly an unreasonable burden for police to ask a suspect, for instance, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to talk to us?\xe2\x80\x9d  The majority in <em>Davis</em> itself approved of this approach as protecting suspects\xe2\x80\x99 rights while \xe2\x80\x9cminimiz[ing] the chance of a confession [later] being suppressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 461.  Given this straightforward mechanism by which police can \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulously hono[r]\xe2\x80\x9d a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s right to silence, today\xe2\x80\x99s clear-statement rule can only be seen as accepting \xe2\x80\x9cas tolerable the certainty that some poorly expressed requests [to remain silent] will be disregarded,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 471 (opinion of Souter, J.), without any countervailing benefit.  Police may well prefer not to seek clarification of an ambiguous statement out of fear that a suspect will invoke his rights.  But \xe2\x80\x9cour system of justice is not founded on a fear that a suspect will exercise his rights.  \xe2\x80\x98If the exercise of constitutional rights will thwart the effectiveness of a system of law enforcement, then there is something very wrong with that system.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burbine</em>, 475 U. S., at 458 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting<em> Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U. S. 478</a>, 490 (1964)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asserts in passing that treating ambiguous statements or acts as an invocation of the right to silence will only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98marginally\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d serve <em>Miranda</em>\xe2\x80\x99s goals.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  Experience suggests the contrary.  In the 16 years since <em>Davis</em> was decided, ample evidence has accrued that criminal suspects often use equivocal or colloquial language in attempting to invoke their right to silence.  A number of lower courts that have (erroneously, in my view) imposed a clear-statement requirement for invocation of the right to silence have rejected as ambiguous an array of statements whose meaning might otherwise be thought plain.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  At a minimum, these decisions suggest that differentiating \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d from \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d statements is often a subjective inquiry.  Even if some of the cited decisions are themselves in tension with <em>Davis</em>\xe2\x80\x99 admonition that a suspect need not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speak with the discrimination of an Oxford don\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to invoke his rights, 512 U. S., at 459 (quoting <em>id.</em>, at 476 (opinion of Souter, J.)), they demonstrate that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will significantly burden the exercise of the right to silence.  Notably, when a suspect \xe2\x80\x9cunderstands his (expressed) wishes to have been ignored \xe2\x80\xa6 in contravention of the \xe2\x80\x98rights\xe2\x80\x99 just read to him by his interrogator, he may well see further objection as futile and confession (true or not) as the only way to end his interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 472\xe2\x80\x93473.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I believe a precautionary requirement that police \xe2\x80\x9cscrupulously hono[r]\xe2\x80\x9d a suspect\xe2\x80\x99s right to cut off questioning is a more faithful application of our precedents than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s awkward and needless extension of <em>Davis</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision turns <em>Miranda</em> upside down.  Criminal suspects must now unambiguously invoke their right to remain silent\xe2\x80\x94which, counterintuitively, requires them to speak.  At the same time, suspects will be legally presumed to have waived their rights even if they have given no clear expression of their intent to do so.  Those results, in my view, find no basis in <em>Miranda</em> or our subsequent cases and are inconsistent with the fair-trial principles on which those precedents are grounded.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s broad new rules are all the more unfortunate because they are unnecessary to the disposition of the case before us.
