S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c), which prohibits using, carrying, or possessing a deadly weapon in connection with \xe2\x80\x9cany crime of violence or drug trafficking crime,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(1).  The minimum prison term for a \xc2\xa7924(c) offense is five years, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \xe2\x80\x9cany other term of imprisonment imposed on the [offender],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  Abbott was convicted on the \xc2\xa7924(c) count, on two predicate drug-trafficking counts, and of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  He received a 15-year mandatory minimum sentence for his felon-in-possession conviction and an additional five years for his \xc2\xa7924(c) violation.  Gould\xe2\x80\x99s predicate drug-trafficking crime carried a ten-year mandatory minimum sentence; he received an additional five years for his \xc2\xa7924(c) violation.  On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged their \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences, resting their objections on the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause prefacing \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).  That clause provides for imposition of a minimum five-year term as a consecutive sentence \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\xc2\xa7924(c) itself] or by any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abbott urged that the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause was triggered by his 15-year felon-in-possession sentence; Gould said the same of the ten years commanded by his predicate trafficking crime.  The Third Circuit affirmed Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, concluding that the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause \xe2\x80\x9crefers only to other minimum sentences that may be imposed\xe2\x80\x9d for \xc2\xa7924(c) violations.  Gould fared no better before the Fifth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>A defendant is subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in \xc2\xa7924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by \xc2\xa7924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 924(c) was enacted as part of the Gun Control Act of 1968, but the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause was not added until 1998.  Under the pre-1998 text, it is undisputed, separate counts of conviction did not preempt \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences, and Abbott and Gould would have been correctly sentenced under \xc2\xa7924(c).  The question here is whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1998 reformulation of \xc2\xa7924(c) rendered their sentences excessive.  The 1998 alteration responded primarily to <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a>, which held that \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of a firearm did not reach \xe2\x80\x9cmere possession\xe2\x80\x9d of a weapon, <em>id.,</em> at 144.  In addition to bringing possession within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s compass, Congress increased the severity of \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences by changing \xe2\x80\x9conce mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___, and by elevating the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.  Congress also restructured the provision, \xe2\x80\x9cdivid[ing] what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at ___, and it added the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The leading portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause now prefacing \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater minimum sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 otherwise provided by [\xc2\xa7924(c) itself]\xe2\x80\x9d; the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside \xc2\xa7924(c) \xe2\x80\x9cby any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  To determine whether a greater minimum sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided \xe2\x80\xa6 by any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the key question is: otherwise provided <em>for what</em>?  Most courts have answered: for the conduct \xc2\xa7924(c) proscribes, <em>i.e.</em>, possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould disagree.  Gould would apply the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause whenever any count of conviction at sentencing requires a greater minimum sentence.  Abbott argues that the minimum sentence \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d must be one imposed for the criminal transaction that triggered \xc2\xa7924(c) or, in the alternative, for a firearm offense involving the same firearm that triggered \xc2\xa7924(c).  These three interpretations share a common, but implausible, premise: that Congress in 1998 adopted  a less aggressive mode of applying \xc2\xa7924(c), one that significantly reduced the severity of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s impact on defendants.  The pre-1998 version of \xc2\xa7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence to be imposed on top of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.  It is unlikely that Congress meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns,\xe2\x80\x9d to effect a departure so great from \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s original insistence that sentencing judges impose <em>additional</em> punishment for \xc2\xa7924(c) violations.  Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s and Gould\xe2\x80\x99s readings would undercut that same bill\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective: to expand \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to reach firearm possession.  Their readings would also result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend.  Section 924(c), as they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.  Stranger still, the worst offenders would often secure shorter sentences than less grave offenders, because the highest sentences on other counts of conviction would be most likely to preempt \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences.  Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of any anomalies and order appropriate adjustments.  While a judge exercising discretion under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a) would not be required to sentence a more culpable defendant to a lesser term, this Court doubts that Congress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, held that district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines based on \xc2\xa73553(a).  Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve disparities by prescribing a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.  But Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended \xc2\xa7924(c) to impose a penalty even when the predicate crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement.  Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of \xc2\xa7924(c) four times, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement might suffice to accomplish \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s objective.  Nor is there any indication that Congress was contemplating the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 relationship to \xc2\xa7924(c) when it added the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading\xe2\x80\x94that the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause is triggered only when another provision commands a longer term for conduct violating \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x94makes far more sense.  It gives effect to statutory language commanding that all \xc2\xa7924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command reiterated three times: First, the statute states that the \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) punishment \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be imposed \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to\xe2\x80\x9d the penalty for the predicate offense, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A); second, \xc2\xa7924(c) demands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime itself \xe2\x80\x9cprovides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>;<font b="1"> third, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that a \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence might \xe2\x80\x9crun concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Interpreting the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause to train on conduct offending \xc2\xa7924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The clause is a proviso, most naturally read to refer to the conduct \xc2\xa7924(c) proscribes.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/531/index.html">266 U. S. 531</a>, 534\xe2\x80\x93535.  There is strong contextual support for the view that the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause was intended simply to clarify \xc2\xa7924(c).  At the same time Congress added the clause, it made the rest of \xc2\xa7924(c) more complex, dividing its existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs, and adding new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.  Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges: It added the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x99s initial part, which covers greater minimums provided \xe2\x80\x9cby this subsection,\xe2\x80\x9d to instruct judges not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the same weapon.  In referencing greater minimums provided by \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the second portion of the clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which \xc2\xa7924(c) and a different statute both punish conduct offending \xc2\xa7924(c).  Congress likely anticipated such cases when framing the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, for the bill that reformulated \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text also amended 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c) to command a life sentence for certain repeat felons convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cfirearms possession (as described in \xc2\xa7924(c)).\xe2\x80\x9d  This interpretation does not render the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause\xe2\x80\x99s second part effectively meaningless.  Though \xc2\xa73559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of \xc2\xa7924(c) itself, that the Government places within the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, the \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law\xe2\x80\x9d portion installs a safety valve for additional sentences that Congress may codify outside \xc2\xa7924(c) in the future.  Neither <em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzales,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, nor <em>Republic of Iraq</em> v. <em>Beaty</em>, 556 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(c)(1).  The minimum prison term for the offense described in \xc2\xa7924(c) is five years, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(i), in addition to \xe2\x80\x9cany other term of imprisonment imposed on the [offender],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(D)(ii).  The two consolidated cases before us call for interpretation of \xc2\xa7924(c) as that provision was reformulated in 1998.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Kevin Abbott and Carlos Rashad Gould, petitioners here, defendants below, were charged with multiple drug and firearm offenses; charges on which they were convicted included violation of \xc2\xa7924(c).  Each objected to the imposition of any additional prison time for his \xc2\xa7924(c) conviction.  Their objections rested on the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause now prefacing \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).  Under that clause, a minimum term of five years shall be imposed as a consecutive sentence \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by [\xc2\xa7924(c) itself] or by any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould read \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause to secure them against prison time for their \xc2\xa7924(c) convictions.  They claim exemption from punishment under \xc2\xa7924(c) because they were sentenced to greater mandatory minimum prison terms for convictions on other counts charging different offenses.  The \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, they urge, ensures that \xc2\xa7924(c) offenders will serve at least five years in prison.  If conviction on a different count yields a mandatory sentence exceeding five years, they maintain, the statutory requirement is satisfied and the penalty specified for the \xc2\xa7924(c) violation becomes inoperative.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The courts below, agreeing with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction of the statute, read \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) as independently requiring a sentence of at least five years, tacked onto any other sentence the defendant receives.  The \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca greater minimum sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 otherwise provided.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9c[O]therwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d <em>for what</em>, the courts below asked; their answer, for conduct offending \xc2\xa7924(c), <em>i.e</em>., possessing a firearm in connection with a crime of violence or drug-trafficking crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A defendant is not spared from a separate, consecutive sentence for a \xc2\xa7924(c) conviction, the lower courts determined, whenever he faces a higher mandatory minimum for a different count of conviction.  Instead, according to the courts below and the Government here, the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause applies only when another provision\xe2\x80\x94whether contained within or placed outside \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x94commands a longer term for conduct violating \xc2\xa7924(c).  For example, the mandatory minimum sentence for a \xc2\xa7924(c) offense is five years, but if the firearm is brandished, the minimum rises to seven years, and if the firearm is discharged, to ten years.  \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(i), (ii), (iii).  A defendant who possessed, brandished, and discharged a firearm in violation of \xc2\xa7924(c) would thus face a mandatory minimum term of ten years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold, in accord with the courts below, and in line with the majority of the Courts of Appeals, that a defendant is subject to a mandatory, consecutive sentence for a \xc2\xa7924(c) conviction, and is not spared from that sentence by virtue of receiving a higher mandatory minimum on a different count of conviction.  Under the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause as we comprehend it, a \xc2\xa7924(c) offender is not subject to stacked sentences for violating \xc2\xa7924(c).  If he possessed, brandished, and discharged a gun, the mandatory penalty would be 10 years, not 22.  He is, however, subject to the highest mandatory minimum specified for his conduct in \xc2\xa7924(c), unless another provision of law directed to conduct proscribed by \xc2\xa7924(c) imposes an even greater mandatory minimum.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould, defendants in unrelated prosecutions, were each charged with violating \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(i) by possessing a firearm in furtherance of a drug-trafficking crime.  Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s case was tried to a jury in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, which convicted him on the \xc2\xa7924(c) count and three others: two predicate trafficking counts, 21 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7841, 846, and being a felon in possession of a firearm, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g).  Given Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s extensive criminal history, his felon-in-possession conviction triggered a 15-year mandatory minimum under the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e).  The District Court sentenced Abbott to the 15 years mandated by ACCA, and to an additional five years for the \xc2\xa7924(c) violation, yielding a total prison term of 20 years.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gould\xe2\x80\x99s indictment listed seven separate drug and firearm charges.  In return for Gould\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to plead guilty, the Government dropped all but two: one \xc2\xa7924(c) offense and one predicate drug-trafficking crime.  The latter, for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute cocaine base, carried a ten-year mandatory minimum under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  Firearm involvement was not an element of that offense.  The United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas imposed a sentence of 11 years and 5 months for the trafficking offense and an additional five years for the \xc2\xa7924(c) violation, for a total of 16 years and 5 months.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Abbott and Gould challenged the five-year consecutive sentence each received under \xc2\xa7924(c).

We begin by setting out \xc2\xa7924(c), first as it read before 1998, then as amended that year.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The earlier version read in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime which provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, uses or carries a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime, be sentenced to imprisonment for five years, and if the firearm is a short-barreled rifle, short-barreled shotgun, or semiautomatic assault weapon, to imprisonment for ten years, and if the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device, or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to imprisonment for thirty years.  In the case of his second or subsequent conviction under this subsection, such person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for twenty years, and if the firearm is a machinegun, or a destructive device, or is equipped with a firearm silencer or firearm muffler, to life imprisonment without release.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, \xe2\x80\xa6 the term of imprisonment imposed under this subsection [shall not] run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment including that imposed for\nthe crime of violence or drug trafficking crime in which the firearm was used or carried.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) (1994 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\nIf this pre-1998 text governed, all agree, separate counts of conviction would have no preemptive force, and Abbott and Gould would have been correctly sentenced under \xc2\xa7924(c).  The question we confront is whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1998 reformulation of \xc2\xa7924(c) rendered the sentences imposed on Abbott and Gould excessive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1998 alteration responded primarily to our decision in <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a> (1995).  In proscribing \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of a firearm, <em>Bailey</em> held, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) did not reach \xe2\x80\x9cmere possession\xe2\x80\x9d of the weapon.  <em>Id.,</em> at 144.  Congress legislated a different result; in the 1998 revision, \xe2\x80\x9ccolloquially known as the Bailey Fix Act,\xe2\x80\x9d the Legislature brought possession within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 14) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the change prompted by <em>Bailey</em>, Congress increased the severity of \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences in two other respects: The 1998 revision \xe2\x80\x9cchanged what were once mandatory sentences into mandatory minimum sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, </em>560 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 13); and it elevated the sentences for brandishing and discharging a firearm and for repeat offenses.  Congress also restructured the provision, \xe2\x80\x9cdivid[ing] what was once a lengthy principal sentence into separate subparagraphs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 7).  And it added the prefatory \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause at issue in the cases now before us.  As amended, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A) prescribes:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cExcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided by this subsection or by any other provision of law, any person who, during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) for which the person may be prosecuted in a court of the United States, uses or carries a firearm, or who, in furtherance of any such crime, possesses a firearm, shall, in addition to the punishment provided for such crime of violence or drug trafficking crime\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(i) be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 5 years;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) if the firearm is brandished, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 7 years; and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(iii) if the firearm is discharged, be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not less than 10 years.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1998 reformulation, furthermore, removed to separate paragraphs the provisions commanding higher penalties for especially destructive weapons and \xe2\x80\x9csecond or subsequent\xe2\x80\x9d offenses.  See \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(B), (C).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  While leaving the penalties for highly destructive weapons unchanged, the revision raised the base punishment for \xe2\x80\x9csecond or subsequent\xe2\x80\x9d offenses from 20 years to 25.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The reformulation also transferred the bar on concurrent sentences to \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(D)(ii):</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o term of imprisonment imposed on a person under this subsection shall run concurrently with any other term of imprisonment imposed on the person, including any term of imprisonment imposed for the crime of violence or drug trafficking crime during which the firearm was used, carried, or possessed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The leading portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, which now prefaces \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A), refers to a \xe2\x80\x9cgreater minimum sentence \xe2\x80\xa6 otherwise provided by this subsection,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, by \xc2\xa7924(c) itself; the second segment of the clause refers to a greater minimum provided outside \xc2\xa7924(c) \xe2\x80\x9cby any other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Beyond debate, the latter instruction does not relieve a \xc2\xa7924(c) offender of additional punishment \xe2\x80\x9csimply because a higher mandatory minimum sentence exists in the United States Code.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner in No. 09\xe2\x80\x93479, p.\xc2\xa019 (hereinafter Abbott Brief).  Were it otherwise, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s ascending series of minimums, set out in \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(C), would have no work to do; the only possible \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence would be the Code\xe2\x80\x99s highest\xe2\x80\x94life.  The \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, it is therefore undisputed, \xe2\x80\x9chas to have <em>some</em> understood referent to be intelligible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Parker</em>, 549 F.\xc2\xa03d 5, 11 (CA1 2008).  What should that referent be?  As we comprehend the clause, to determine whether a greater minimum sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided \xe2\x80\xa6 by any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d the key question one must ask is: otherwise provided <em>for what</em>?  As earlier noted, see <em>supra</em>, at 3, most courts, in line with the courts below and the Government, have answered: for the conduct \xc2\xa7924(c) proscribes, <em>i.e.</em>, possessing a firearm in connection with a predicate crime.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould disagree and offer diverse readings.  Gould principally would apply the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause to preclude a \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence whenever \xe2\x80\x9cany of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s counts of convictio[n] at sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d require a greater minimum sentence.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 09\xe2\x80\x937073, p.\xc2\xa014 (hereinafter Gould Brief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In lieu of Gould\xe2\x80\x99s position that any greater minimum sentence on a different count of conviction will do, Abbott advances a somewhat narrower \xe2\x80\x9ctransactional approach.\xe2\x80\x9d  Any sentence imposed on the defendant fits the bill, he urges, so long as the sentence was imposed \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of the criminal transaction that triggered \xc2\xa7924(c) in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  Abbott Brief 10.  Accord <em>United States </em>v. <em>Williams</em>, 558 F.\xc2\xa03d 166, 171 (CA2 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott also tenders an alternative construction: The minimum sentence \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise provided\xe2\x80\x9d must be for a firearm offense\xe2\x80\x94for example, Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s felon-in-possession charge\xe2\x80\x94involving the same firearm that triggered \xc2\xa7924(c).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Conceding that this reading is \xe2\x80\x9cnot commanded by the [statute\xe2\x80\x99s] plain language,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 24, Abbott asserts that it advances \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s goal\xe2\x80\x94to discourage bearing arms in furtherance of crime\xe2\x80\x94while avoiding the imposition of \xe2\x80\x9ctwo consecutive mandatory minimum sentences for the single use of a single firearm,\xe2\x80\x9d Abbott Brief 47 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three interpretations just described share a common premise.  In adding the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause in 1998, all three posit, Congress adopted a less aggressive mode of applying \xc2\xa7924(c), one that significantly reduced the severity of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s impact on defendants.  Like the courts below, we regard this premise as implausible.  As earlier observed, see <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, the pre-1998 version of \xc2\xa7924(c) prescribed a discrete sentence\xe2\x80\x94punishment to be imposed regardless of the sentence received for the predicate crime or any separate firearm conviction.  Abbott and Gould think the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause installed, instead, a modest scheme designed simply to ensure that all \xc2\xa7924(c) offenders \xe2\x80\x9cserve at least 5 years in prison.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gould Brief 5; see Abbott Brief 10.  We doubt that Congress meant a prefatory clause, added in a bill dubbed \xe2\x80\x9cAn Act [t]o throttle criminal use of guns,\xe2\x80\x9d to effect a departure so great from \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding thrust, <em>i.e.</em>, its insistence that sentencing judges impose <em>additional</em> punishment for \xc2\xa7924(c) violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were we to accept any of the readings proposed by Abbott or Gould, it bears emphasis, we would undercut that same bill\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective: to expand \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to reach firearm possession.  In 1999, more than half of those who violated \xc2\xa7924(c) in connection with a drug-trafficking offense received a mandatory minimum of ten years or more for that trafficking offense.  Letter from Glenn R. Schmitt, United States Sentencing Commission, to Supreme Court Library (Nov. 10, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Congress, however, imposed only a five-year minimum for firearm possession \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of\xe2\x80\x9d a drug offense.  As construed by Abbott and Gould, the amendment to include firearm possession as a \xc2\xa7924(c) offense would spare the most serious drug offenders from any discrete punishment for the very firearm activity the amendment targeted.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe are disinclined to say that what Congress imposed with one hand \xe2\x80\xa6 it withdrew with the other \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Logan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/23/index.html">552 U. S. 23</a>, 35 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s and Gould\xe2\x80\x99s proposed readings, moreover, would result in sentencing anomalies Congress surely did not intend.  We note first that \xc2\xa7924(c), as they construe it, would often impose no penalty at all for the conduct that provision makes independently criminal.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 52.  For example, an individual who sold enough drugs to receive a ten-year minimum sentence under \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A) could, so far as \xc2\xa7924(c) is concerned, possess or even brandish a gun without incurring any additional punishment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stranger still, under the Abbott and Gould readings, the worst offenders would often secure the shortest sentences.  Consider two defendants convicted of trafficking in cocaine.  The first possesses 500 grams and is subject to a mandatory minimum of five years, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(B); the second possesses five kilograms and is subject to a mandatory minimum of ten years, \xc2\xa7841(b)(1)(A).  Both brandish firearms, calling for a sentence of seven years under \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)(ii).  The first defendant, under all readings, will spend at least 12 years in prison.  The second defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ten-year drug minimum, according to Abbott and Gould, triggers the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause and wipes out that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7924(c) penalty; though the more culpable of the two, the second defendant\xe2\x80\x99s minimum term would be just ten years.  Brief for United States 40.  Like the Third Circuit below, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e are confident that Congress did not intend such a bizarre result.\xe2\x80\x9d  574 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 209.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s alternative construction, which homes in on other firearm offenses, gives rise to similar oddities.  On this reading, Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s 15-year ACCA sentence for being a felon-in-possession would preempt his five-year \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence, and his minimum term would be 15 years, rather than 20.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  But if ACCA were not at issue, Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s minimum term would be the same 15 years: his five-\nyear \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence on top of his ten-year drug sen-\ntence.  Qualification as a career criminal would carry no consequence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does Abbott\xe2\x80\x99s second construction necessarily promote more equitable outcomes.  Suppose, for example, that a career criminal sold drugs together with a first-time offender, and both brandished firearms in the process.  The first-time offender, lacking a felon-in-possession conviction, would serve a seven-year \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence on top of a ten-year drug sentence, for a total of 17 years.  But the career criminal\xe2\x80\x99s ACCA sentence would preempt the \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence; he would serve only 15 years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould respond that sentencing judges may take account of such anomalies and order appropriate adjustments.  We observe first that no correction or avoidance appears possible for the anomaly that, while \xc2\xa7924(c) \xe2\x80\x9cdefines a standalone crime,\xe2\x80\x9d a \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence would be wiped out by a wholly separate and independent conviction.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Easter</em>, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d 519, 526 (CA7 2009) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cA determination of guilt that yields no sentence is not a judgment of conviction at all.\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do, however, agree that a judge exercising discretion under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a) \xe2\x80\x9cwould [not] be <em>required</em> to sentence\xe2\x80\x9d a more culpable defendant to a lesser term; the judge could increase that defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence for a predicate crime to make up for \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s failure to effect any enlargement of the time served.  <em>United States </em>v<em>.</em> <em>Whitley</em>, 529 F.\xc2\xa03d 150, 155 (CA2 2008).  But we doubt Congress had such a cure in mind in 1998, seven years before we held, in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a> (2005), that district courts have discretion to depart from the Sentencing Guidelines on the basis of \xc2\xa73553(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Abbott and Gould alternatively contend that Congress could have anticipated that the then-mandatory Guidelines would resolve disparities.  See Abbott Brief 32\xe2\x80\x9335; Gould Brief 30\xe2\x80\x9332.  On this view, the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause ensures that a \xc2\xa7924(c) offender incurs a minimum sentence of considerable length; the Guidelines would then control, elevating that sentence based on firearm possession or use.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(5) (Nov. 1998) (increasing offense level for defendants who use or possess firearms in course of violent crime or drug trafficking); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72D1.1(b)(1), 2K2.1(b)(6) (Nov. 2009) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not gainsay that Abbott and Gould project a rational, less harsh, mode of sentencing.  But we do not think it was the mode Congress ordered.  Congress expressly rejected an analogous scheme in 1984, when it amended \xc2\xa7924(c) in the same law that created the Sentencing Commission and the Guidelines.  Pub. L. 98\xe2\x80\x93473, 98 Stat. 1987, 2138.  Four years earlier, in <em>Busic </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/398/index.html">446 U. S. 398</a>, 404 (1980), we had read \xc2\xa7924(c) to impose no penalty when the predicate crime itself prescribed a firearm enhancement; similarly, Abbott and Gould now read \xc2\xa7924(c) to impose no penalty when the Guidelines prescribe a firearm enhancement to the predicate sentence.  The 1984 legislation \xe2\x80\x9crepudiated\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Busic</em>, clarifying that \xc2\xa7924(c) applied even when the predicate crime already \xe2\x80\x9cprovides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 10 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between 1984 and 1998, Congress expanded the reach or increased the severity of \xc2\xa7924(c) on four occasions, never suggesting that a Guidelines firearm enhancement might suffice to accomplish \xc2\xa7924(c)\xe2\x80\x99s objective.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Nor is there the slightest indication that Congress was contemplating the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 relationship to \xc2\xa7924(c) when it added the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause in the 1998 amendments.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 The \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, we note, would have been a most haphazard way to achieve a Guidelines-driven rollback of \xc2\xa7924(c).  If Congress wanted to ensure that \xc2\xa7924(c) offenders \xe2\x80\x9creceive at least five years in prison,\xe2\x80\x9d and to rely on the Guidelines for the rest, Abbott Brief 10, there was an obvious solution: Congress could have excised all prescriptions ordering that \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences shall run consecutively to other sentences.  Without such a requirement, <em>all</em> defendants would benefit from a minimum-plus-Guidelines regime\xe2\x80\x94not just the most culpable offenders.  Congress did not adopt that obvious solution, we think, because it did not want the Guidelines to supplant \xc2\xa7924(c).</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, we are convinced, makes far more sense than the interpretations urged by Abbott and Gould.  In imposing a sentence for a \xc2\xa7924(c) violation \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept to the extent that a greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided . . . by any other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress meant:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f another provision of the United States Code mandates a punishment for using, carrying, or possessing a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking crime or crime of violence, and that minimum sentence is longer than the punishment applicable under \xc2\xa7924(c), then the longer sentence applies.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 17.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reading gives effect to the statutory language commanding that all \xc2\xa7924(c) offenders shall receive additional punishment for their violation of that provision, a command reiterated three times.  First, the statute states that the punishment specified in \xc2\xa7924(c)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be imposed \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to\xe2\x80\x9d the penalty for the predicate offense.  \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A).  Second, after <em>Busic</em>, \xc2\xa7924(c) demands a discrete punishment even if the predicate crime itself \xe2\x80\x9cprovides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Third, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(D)(ii) rules out the possibility that a \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence might \xe2\x80\x9crun concurrently with any other term of imprisonment.\xe2\x80\x9d  We doubt that Congress, having retained this thrice-repeated instruction, would simultaneously provide an exception severely limiting application of the instruction.  Cf. <em>Greenlaw</em> v. <em>United States</em>,\n<a href="/cases/federal/us/554/237/index.html">554 U. S. 237</a>, 251 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe resist attributing to Congress an intention to render a statute so internally\ninconsistent.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Interpreting the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause to train on conduct offending \xc2\xa7924(c) also makes sense as a matter of syntax.  The \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause is not a standalone enactment, or even a standalone sentence.  Rather, it precedes and qualifies \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x99s principal clause, which punishes the possession of a firearm in connection with specified predicate crimes.  The \xe2\x80\x9cgrammatical and logical scope\xe2\x80\x9d of a proviso, we have held, \xe2\x80\x9cis confined to the subject-matter of the principal clause\xe2\x80\x9d to which it is attached.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Morrow</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/266/531/index.html">266 U. S. 531</a>, 534\xe2\x80\x93535 (1925).  As a proviso attached to \xc2\xa7924(c), the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause is most naturally read to refer to the conduct \xc2\xa7924(c) proscribes.  Accord <em>United States </em>v.<em> Villa, </em>589 F.\xc2\xa03d 1334, 1343 (CA10 2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is strong contextual support for our view that Congress intended the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause to serve simply as a clarification of \xc2\xa7924(c), not as a major restraint on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s operation.  At the same time Congress added the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, it made the rest of \xc2\xa7924(c) more complex.  The 1998 revision divided the statute\xe2\x80\x99s existing sentencing prescriptions into four paragraphs in lieu of one, and added new penalties for brandishing and discharging a firearm.  \xc2\xa7924(c)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(D).  We know that Congress thought the restructuring might confuse sentencing judges: Warding off confusion, all agree, was the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s sole objective in adding the initial part of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause, which covers greater minimums provided \xe2\x80\x9cby this subsection.\xe2\x80\x9d  That portion of the clause instructs judges to pick the single highest sentence stipulated for a \xc2\xa7924(c) violation within \xc2\xa7924(c) itself, and not to stack ten years for discharging a gun on top of seven for brandishing the same weapon, whenever a defendant does both.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In referencing greater minimums provided by \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law,\xe2\x80\x9d we think, the second portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause simply furnishes the same no-stacking instruction for cases in which \xc2\xa7924(c) and a different statute both punish conduct offending \xc2\xa7924(c).  Congress likely anticipated such cases when the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause was framed in 1998, for the bill that reformulated the text of \xc2\xa7924(c) did just one thing more: It amended 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73559(c) to command a life sentence when certain repeat felons are convicted of \xe2\x80\x9cfirearms possession (as described in \xc2\xa7924(c)).\xe2\x80\x9d  Pub. L. 105\xe2\x80\x93386, \xc2\xa71(b), 112 Stat. 3470.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our interpretation, Abbott and Gould protest, renders the second part of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause effectively meaningless.  Section 3559(c) is the only existing statute, outside of \xc2\xa7924(c) itself, the Government places within the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 32\xe2\x80\x9335, 42\xe2\x80\x9344.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  But \xc2\xa73559(c) already imposes a life sentence.  A defendant would find little comfort in knowing that no \xc2\xa7924(c) sentence, say five years or seven, will be tacked on to his \xc2\xa73559(c) life term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As Courts of Appeals have observed, however, the \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause installs a \xe2\x80\x9csafety valve.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Studifin</em>, 240 F.\xc2\xa03d 415, 423 (CA4 2001).  It \xe2\x80\x9callow[s] for additional \xc2\xa7924(c) sentences,\xe2\x80\x9d akin to the sentence prescribed in \xc2\xa73559(c), that Congress may codify outside \xc2\xa7924(c) \xe2\x80\x9cin the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Abbott</em>, 574 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 208.

But our decision on the petitions of Abbott and Gould does not turn on artificial confinement of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cany other provision of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  We rely, instead, on the different direction Congress prescribed for the \xe2\x80\x9cexcept\xe2\x80\x9d clause: It applies only when \xe2\x80\x9ca greater minimum sentence is otherwise provided.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cIn the contest between reading\xe2\x80\x9d that phrase \xe2\x80\x9cto refer to penalties for the [\xc2\xa7924(c)] offense in question or to penalties for any [other] offense [a defendant commits], we believe the former is the most natural.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Easter</em>, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 526.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated, the judgments of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit and the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit are</p>\n<p align="left">Affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Abbott received ten years on each drug-trafficking count.
