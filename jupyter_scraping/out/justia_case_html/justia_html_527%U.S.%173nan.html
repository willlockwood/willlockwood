For example, federal law prohibits a broadcaster from carrying advertising about privately operated commercial casino gambling regardless of the station\'s or casino\'s location, but exempts advertising about state-run casinos, certain occasional commercial casino gambling, and tribal casino gambling even if the broadcaster is located in, or broadcasts to, a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies.

Federal law prohibits some, but by no means all, broadcast advertising of lotteries and casino gambling. In <i>United States </i>v. <i>Edge Broadcasting Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/509/418/case.html">509 U. S. 418</a> (1993), we upheld the constitutionality of 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1304 as applied to broadcast advertising of Virginia\'s lottery by a radio station located in North Carolina, where no such lottery was authorized. Today we hold that \xc2\xa7 1304 may not be applied to advertisements of private casino gambling that are broadcast by radio or television stations located in Louisiana, where such gambling is legal.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Through most of the 19th and the first half of the 20th centuries, Congress adhered to a policy that not only discouraged the operation of lotteries and similar schemes, but forbade the dissemination of information concerning such enterprises by use of the mails, even when the lottery in question was chartered by a state legislature.1 Consistent with this Court\'s earlier view that commercial advertising was unprotected by the First Amendment, see <i>Valentine </i>v. <i>Chrestensen, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/316/52/case.html">316 U. S. 52</a>, 54 (1942), we found that the notion that "lotteries ... are supposed to have a demoralizing influence upon the people" provided sufficient justification for excluding circulars concerning such enterprises from the federal postal system, <i>Ex parte Jackson, </i>96 U. S.</p><p>1 See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>Act of Mar. 2, 1895, 28 Stat. 963 (prohibiting the transportation in interstate or foreign commerce, and the mailing of, tickets and advertisements for lotteries and similar enterprises); Act of Mar. 2, 1827, \xc2\xa7 6, 4 Stat. 238 (restricting the participation of postmasters and assistant postmasters in the lottery business); Act of July 27, 1868, \xc2\xa7 13, 15 Stat. 196 (prohibiting the mailing of any letters or circulars concerning lotteries or similar enterprises); Act of July 12, 1876, \xc2\xa7 2, 19 Stat. 90 (repealing an 1872 limitation of the mails prohibition to letters and circulars concerning "illegal" lotteries); Anti-Lottery Act of 1890, \xc2\xa7 1, 26 Stat. 465 (extending the mails prohibition to newspapers containing advertisements or prize lists for lotteries or gift enterprises).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="177">177</a></p><p>727, 736-737 (1878). We likewise deferred to congressional judgment in upholding the similar exclusion for newspapers that contained either lottery advertisements or prize lists. <i>In re Rapier, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/143/110/case.html">143 U. S. 110</a>, 134-135 (1892); see generally <i>Edge, </i>509 U. S., at 421-422; <i>Lottery Case, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/321/case.html">188 U. S. 321</a> (1903). The current versions of these early antilottery statutes are now codified at 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301-1303.</p><p>Congress extended its restrictions on lottery-related information to broadcasting as communications technology made that practice both possible and profitable. It enacted the statute at issue in this case as \xc2\xa7 316 of the Communications Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 1088. Now codified at 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1304 ("Broadcasting lottery information"), the statute prohibits radio and television broadcasting, by any station for which a license is required, of</p><blockquote><p>\n"any advertisement of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or similar scheme, offering prizes dependent in whole or in part upon lot or chance, or any list of the prizes drawn or awarded by means of any such lottery, gift enterprise, or scheme, whether said list contains any part or all of such prizes."</p></blockquote><p>The statute provides that each day\'s prohibited broadcasting constitutes a separate offense punishable by a fine, imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. <i>Ibid. </i>Although \xc2\xa7 1304 is a criminal statute, the Solicitor General informs us that, in practice, the provision traditionally has been enforced by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), which imposes administrative sanctions on radio and television licensees for violations of the agency\'s implementing regulation. See 47 CFR \xc2\xa7 73.1211 (1998); Brief for Respondents 3. Petitioners now concede that the broadcast ban in \xc2\xa7 1304 and the FCC\'s regulation encompasses advertising for privately owned casinos-a concession supported by the broad language of the statute, our precedent, and the</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="178">178</a></p><p align="center">\n178 GREATER NEW ORLEANS BROADCASTING ASSN., INC. <i>v. </i>UNITED STATES</p><p>FCC\'s sound interpretation. See <i>FCC </i>v. <i>American Broadcasting Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/284/case.html">347 U. S. 284</a>, 290-291, and n. 8 (1954).</p><p>During the second half of this century, Congress dramatically narrowed the scope of the broadcast prohibition in \xc2\xa7 1304. The first inroad was minor: In 1950, certain notfor-profit fishing contests were exempted as "innocent pastimes ... far removed from the reprehensible type of gambling activity which it was paramount in the congressional mind to forbid." S. Rep. No. 2243, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., 2 (1950); see Act of Aug. 16, 1950, ch. 722, 64 Stat. 451, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1305.</p><p>Subsequent exemptions were more substantial. Responding to the growing popularity of state-run lotteries, in 1975 Congress enacted the provision that gave rise to our decision in <i>Edge. </i>509 U. S., at 422-423; Act of Jan. 2, 1975, 88 Stat. 1916, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1307; see also \xc2\xa7 1953(b)(4). With subsequent modifications, that amendment now exempts advertisements of state-conducted lotteries from the nationwide postal restrictions in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301 and 1302, and from the broadcast restriction in \xc2\xa7 1304, when "broadcast by a radio or television station licensed to a location in ... a State which conducts such a lottery." \xc2\xa7 1307(a)(1)(B); see also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1307(a)(1)(A), (b)(l). The \xc2\xa7 1304 broadcast restriction remained in place, however, for stations licensed in States that do not conduct lotteries. In <i>Edge, </i>we held that this remaining restriction on broadcasts from nonlottery States, such as North Carolina, supported the "laws against gambling" in those jurisdictions and properly advanced the "congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery States." 509 U. S., at 428.</p><p>In 1988, Congress enacted two additional statutes that significantly curtailed the coverage of \xc2\xa7 1304. First, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 102 Stat. 2467, 25 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2701 <i>et seq., </i>authorized Native American tribes to conduct various forms of gambling-including casino gambling-pursuant to tribal-state compacts if the State permits</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="179">179</a></p><p>such gambling "for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity." \xc2\xa7 2710(d)(1)(B). The IGRA also exempted "any gaming conducted by an Indian tribe pursuant to" the Act from both the postal and transportation restrictions in 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301-1302, and the broadcast restriction in \xc2\xa7 1304. 25 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2720. Second, the Charity Games Advertising Clarification Act of 1988, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1307(a)(2), extended the exemption from \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1301-1304 for state-run lotteries to include any other lottery, gift enterprise, or similar schemenot prohibited by the law of the State in which it operates-when conducted by: (i) any governmental organization; (ii) any not-for-profit organization; or (iii) a commercial organization as a promotional activity "clearly occasional and ancillary to the primary business of that organization." There is no dispute that the exemption in \xc2\xa7 1307(a)(2) applies to casinos conducted by state and local governments. And, unlike the 1975 broadcast exemption for advertisements of and information concerning state-conducted lotteries, the exemptions in both of these 1988 statutes are not geographically limited; they shield messages from \xc2\xa7 1304\'s reach in States that do not authorize such gambling as well as those that do.</p><p>A separate statute, the 1992 Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3701 <i>et seq., </i>proscribes most sports betting and advertising thereof. Section 3702 makes it unlawful for a State or tribe "to sponsor, operate, advertise, promote, license, or authorize by law or compact" -or for a person "to sponsor, operate, advertise, or promote, pursuant to the law or compact" of a State or tribe-any lottery or gambling scheme based directly or indirectly on competitive games in which amateur or professional athletes participate. However, the Act also includes a variety of exemptions, some with obscured congressional purposes: (i) gambling schemes conducted by States or other governmental entities at any time between January 1, 1976, and August 31, 1990; (ii) gambling schemes authorized by</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="180">180</a></p><p align="center">\n180 GREATER NEW ORLEANS BROADCASTING ASSN., INC. <i>v. </i>UNITED STATES</p><p>statutes in effect on October 2, 1991; (iii) gambling "conducted exclusively in casinos" located in certain municipalities if the schemes were authorized within 1 year of the effective date of the Act and, for "commercial casino gaming scheme[s]," that had been in operation for the preceding 10 years pursuant to a state constitutional provision and comprehensive state regulation applicable to that municipality; and (iv) gambling on parimutuel animal racing or jai-alai games. \xc2\xa7 3704(a); see also 18 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1953(b)(1)-(3) (regarding interstate transportation of wagering paraphernalia). These exemptions make the scope of \xc2\xa7 3702\'s advertising prohibition somewhat unclear, but the prohibition is not limited to broadcast media and does not depend on the location of a broadcast station or other disseminator of promotional materials.</p><p>Thus, unlike the uniform federal antigambling policy that prevailed in 1934 when 18 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1304 was enacted, federal statutes now accommodate both progambling and antigambling segments of the national polity.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Petitioners are an association of Louisiana broadcasters and its members who operate FCC-licensed radio and television stations in the New Orleans metropolitan area. But for the threat of sanctions pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1304 and the FCC\'s companion regulation, petitioners would broadcast promotional advertisements for gaming available at private, forprofit casinos that are lawful and regulated in both Louisiana and neighboring Mississippi.2 According to an FCC official, however, "[u]nder appropriate conditions, some broadcast signals from Louisiana broadcasting stations may be heard</p><p>2 See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>La.

After noting that all parties agreed that the case should be decided on their crossmotions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled in favor of the Government. 866 F. Supp. 975, 976 (1994).

Brief for Respondents 15-16. With respect to casino gambling, the Solicitor General states that many of the associated social costs stem from "pathological" or "compulsive" gambling by approximately 3 million Americans, whose behavior is primarily associated with "continuous play" games, such as slot machines.

Assuming the accuracy of this causal chain, it does not necessarily follow that the Government\'s speech ban has directly and materially furthered the asserted interest. While it is no doubt fair to assume that more advertising would have some impact on overall demand for gambling, it is also reasonable to assume that much of that advertising would merely channel gamblers to one casino rather than another. More important, any measure of the effectiveness of the Government\'s attempt to minimize the social costs of gambling cannot ignore Congress\' simultaneous encouragement of tribal casino gambling, which may well be growing at a rate exceeding any increase in gambling or compulsive gambling that private casino advertising could produce. See n. 5, <i>supra. </i>And, as the Court of Appeals recognized, the Government fails to "connect casino gambling and compulsive gambling with broadcast advertising for casinos"-let alone broadcast advertising for non-Indian commercial casinos. 149 F. 3d, at 339.6</p><p>6 The Government cites several secondary sources and declarations that it put before the Federal District Court in New Jersey and, as an alternative to affirming the judgment below, requests a remand so that it may have another chance to build a record in the Fifth Circuit.

On the other hand, advertisements for tribal casino gambling authorized by state compacts-whether operated by the tribe or by a private party pursuant to a management contract-are subject to no such broadcast ban, even if the broadcaster is located in, or broadcasts to, a jurisdiction with the strictest of antigambling policies. 25 U.

Brief for Respondents 38. If such direct regulation provides a basis for believing that the social costs of gambling in tribal casinos are sufficiently mitigated to make their advertising tolerable, one would have thought that Congress might have at least experimented with comparable regulation before abridging the speech rights of federally unregulated casinos. While Congress\' failure to institute such direct regulation of private casino gambling does not necessarily compromise the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 1304, it does undermine the asserted justifications for the restriction before us. See <i>Rubin, </i>514 U. S., at 490-491. There surely are practical and nonspeech-related forms of regulation-including a prohibition or supervision of gambling on credit; limitations on the use of cash machines on casino premises; controls on admissions; pot or betting limits; location restrictions; and licensing requirements-that could more directly and effectively alleviate some of the social costs of casino gambling.</p><p>We reached a similar conclusion in <i>Rubin. </i>There, we considered the effect of conflicting federal policies on the Government\'s claim that a speech restriction materially advanced its interest in preventing so-called "strength wars" among competing sellers of certain alcoholic beverages.

It does not follow, however, that those differences also justify abridging non-Indians\' freedom of speech more severely than the freedom of their tribal competitors. For the power to prohibit or to regulate particular conduct does not necessarily include the power to prohibit or regulate speech about that conduct. <i>J,J, </i><i>Liquormart, </i>517 U.

It is well settled that the First Amendment mandates closer scrutiny of government restrictions on speech than of its regulation of commerce alone. <i>Fox, </i>492 U. S., at 480. And to the extent that the purpose and operation of federal law distinguishes among information about tribal, governmental, and private casinos based on the identity of their owners or operators, the Government presents no sound reason why such lines bear any meaningful relationship to the particular interest asserted: minimizing casino gambling and its social costs by way of a (partial) broadcast ban. <i>Discovery Network, </i>507 U.

Even under the degree of scrutiny that we have</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="194">194</a></p><p align="center">\n194 GREATER NEW ORLEANS BROADCASTING ASSN., INC. <i>v. </i>UNITED STATES</p><p>applied in commercial speech cases, decisions that select among speakers conveying virtually identical messages are in serious tension with the principles undergirding the First Amendment. Cf. <i>Carey </i>v. <i>Brown, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/447/455/case.html">447 U. S. 455</a>, 465 (1980); <i>First Nat.

We cannot see how this broadcast restraint, ambivalent as it is, might directly and adequately further any <i>state </i>interest in dampening consumer demand for casino gambling if it cannot achieve the same goal with respect to the similar <i>federal </i>interest.</p><p>Furthermore, even assuming that the state policies on which the Federal Government seeks to embellish are more coherent and pressing than their federal counterpart, \xc2\xa7 1304 sacrifices an intolerable amount of truthful speech about lawful conduct when compared to all of the policies at stake and the social ills that one could reasonably hope such a ban to eliminate. The Government argues that petitioners\' speech about private casino gambling should be prohibited in Louisiana because, "under appropriate conditions," 3 Record 628, citizens in neighboring States like Arkansas and Texas (which hosts tribal, but not private, commercial casino gambling) might hear it and make rash or costly decisions. To be sure, in order to achieve a broader objective such regulations may incidentally, even deliberately, restrict a certain amount of speech not thought to contribute significantly to the dangers with which the Government is concerned. See <i>Fox, </i>492 U. S., at 480; cf. <i>Edge, </i>509 U. S., at 429-430.8 But Congress\' choice here was neither a rough</p><p>8 As we stated in <i>Edge: </i>"[A]pplying the restriction to a broadcaster such as [respondent] directly advances the governmental interest in enforcing the restriction in nonlottery States, while not interfering with the policies of lottery States like Virginia ....

Rather, the regulation distinguishes among the indistinct, permitting a variety of speech that poses the same risks the Government purports to fear, while banning messages unlikely to cause any harm at all. Considering the manner in which \xc2\xa7 1304 and its exceptions operate and the scope of the speech it proscribes, the Government\'s second asserted interest provides no more convincing basis for upholding the regulation than the first.</p><p align="center">\nVI</p><p>Accordingly, respondents cannot overcome the presumption that the speaker and the audience, not the Government, should be left to assess the value of accurate and nonmisleading information about lawful conduct. <i>Edenfield, 507 </i>U. S., at 767. Had the Federal Government adopted a more coherent policy, or accommodated the rights of speakers in States that have legalized the underlying conduct, see <i>Edge, </i>509 U. S., at 428, this might be a different case. But under current federal law, as applied to petitioners and the messages that they wish to convey, the broadcast prohibition in 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1304 and 47 CFR \xc2\xa7 73.1211 (1998) violates the</p><p>modating the policies of both lottery and nonlottery States." 509 U. S., at 429-430. The Government points out that <i>Edge </i>hypothesized that Congress "might have" held fast to a more consistent and broader antigambling policy by continuing to ban all radio or television advertisements for state-run lotteries, even by stations licensed in States with legalized lotteries. <i>Id., </i>at 428. That dictum does not support the validity of the speech restriction in this case. In that passage, we identified the actual federal interest at stake; we did not endorse any and all nationwide bans on nonmisleading broadcast advertising related to lotteries. As the Court explained, "Instead of favoring either the lottery or the nonlottery State, Congress opted to" accommodate the policies of both; and it was "[t]his congressional policy of balancing the interests of lottery and nonlottery States" that was "the substantial governmental interest that satisfie[d] <i>Central Hudson."

I agree with the Court that "[t]he operation of \xc2\xa7 1304 and its attendant regulatory regime is so pierced by exemptions and inconsistencies," <i>ante, </i>at 190, that it violates the First Amendment. But, as the Court observes:</p><blockquote><p>\n"There surely are practical and nonspeech-related forms of regulation-including a prohibition or supervision of gambling on credit; limitations on the use of cash machines on casino premises; controls on admissions; pot or betting limits; location restrictions; and licensing requirements-that could more directly and effectively alleviate some of the social costs of casino gambling." <i>Ante, </i>at 192.</p></blockquote><p>Were Congress to undertake substantive regulation of the gambling industry, rather than simply the manner in which it may broadcast advertisements, "exemptions and inconsistencies" such as those in \xc2\xa7 1304 might well prove constitutionally tolerable. "The problem of legislative classification is a perennial one, admitting of no doctrinaire definition. Evils in the same field may be of different dimensions and proportions, requiring different remedies. Or so the legislature may think. Or the reform may take one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute to the legislative mind.
