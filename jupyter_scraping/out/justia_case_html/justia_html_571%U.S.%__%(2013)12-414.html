After explaining to respondent that the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s attorney negotiated a manslaughter plea in exchange for an agreement to testify against Billie.  Three days before Billie\xe2\x80\x99s trial, respondent retained a new attorney, Frederick Toca, who demanded an even lower sentence in exchange for the guilty plea and testimony.  The prosecutor rejected the proposal, and respondent withdrew the original plea.  Without that testimony, Billie was acquitted.  Respondent was subsequently convicted of second-degree murder.  On direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca provided ineffective assistance by advising withdrawal of the plea without taking time to learn the strength of the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  The Michigan Court of Appeals rejected the claim, concluding that Toca\xe2\x80\x99s actions were reasonable in light of his client\xe2\x80\x99s protestations of innocence.  On federal habeas review, the District Court applied the deferential standard of review set forth in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling was reasonable on the law and facts, and denied relief.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  It found the factual predicate for the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94that the plea withdrawal was based on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of innocence\xe2\x80\x94an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record, given Toca\xe2\x80\x99s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that the decision to withdraw was made because the State\xe2\x80\x99s original plea offer was higher than the sentencing range provided by the Michigan guidelines.

The facts that respondent passed a polygraph test denying being in the room when Billie\xe2\x80\x99s husband was killed, discussed the case with a jailer who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was indeed innocent, and hired Toca just three days before Billie\xe2\x80\x99s trial at which respondent had agreed to self-incriminate, strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to Toca.  The only evidence cited by the Sixth Circuit for its contrary conclusion was that Toca\xe2\x80\x99s sole explanation at the withdrawal hearing focused on the fact that the State\xe2\x80\x99s plea offer was substantially higher than that provided by the Michigan guidelines.  The Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca\xe2\x80\x99s representations to the trial court and correctly found nothing inconsistent about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal punishment on the other.  Accepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence to Toca, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.  More troubling is that court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Toca was ineffective because the record contained no evidence that he gave constitutionally adequate advice on whether to withdraw the plea.  The Sixth Circuit turned on its head the principle that counsel should be \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668\n, with the burden to show otherwise resting squarely on the defendant, id., at 687.  The single fact that Toca failed to retrieve respondent\xe2\x80\x99s file from former counsel before withdrawing the guilty plea cannot overcome Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s strong presumption of effectiveness.  In any event, respondent admitted in open court that former counsel had explained the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and that it would support a first-degree murder conviction.  Toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Toca\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary, but a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s ethical violations do not make the lawyer per\xc2\xa0se ineffective, and Toca\xe2\x80\x99s questionable conduct was irrelevant to the narrow issue before the Sixth Circuit.

Cullen v. Pinholster, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 17).  In this case, the Sixth Circuit failed to apply that doubly deferential standard by refusing to credit a state court\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable factual finding and by assuming that counsel was ineffective where the record was silent.  Because the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), \n\n110Stat.\n1214, and Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n, do not permit federal judges to so casually second-guess the decisions of their state-court colleagues or defense attorneys, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision must be reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Titlow and Billie Rogers, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s aunt, murdered Billie\xe2\x80\x99s husband Don by pouring vodka down his throat and smothering him with a pillow.  With help from attorney Richard Lustig, respondent reached an agreement with state prosecutors to testify against Billie, plead guilty to manslaughter, and receive a 7- to 15-year sentence.  As confirmed at a plea hearing, Lustig reviewed the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence with respondent \xe2\x80\x9cover a long period of time,\xe2\x80\x9d and respondent understood that that evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder.

With Toca\xe2\x80\x99s help, respondent demanded a substantially lower minimum sentence (three years, instead of seven) in exchange for the agreement to plead guilty and testify.  When the prosecutor refused to accede to the new demands, respondent withdrew the plea, acknowledging in open court the consequences of withdrawal (including reinstatement of the first-degree murder charge).  Without respondent\xe2\x80\x99s critical testimony, Billie Rogers was acquitted, and later died.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent subsequently stood trial.  During the course of the trial, respondent denied any intent to harm Don Rogers or any knowledge, at the time respondent covered his mouth or poured vodka down his throat, that Billie intended to harm him.  Indeed, respondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie from harming her husband.  The jury, however, elected to believe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s previous out-of-court statements, which squarely demonstrated participation in the killing, and convicted respondent of second-degree murder.  The trial court imposed a 20- to 40-year term of imprisonment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn direct appeal, respondent argued that Toca advised withdrawal of the guilty plea without taking time to learn more about the case, thereby failing to realize the strength of the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and providing ineffective assistance of counsel.  Rejecting that claim, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that Toca acted reasonably in light of his client\xe2\x80\x99s protestations of innocence.  That court found that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s decision to hire Toca was \xe2\x80\x9cset in motion\xe2\x80\x9d by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatement to a sheriff\xe2\x80\x99s deputy that [respondent] did not commit the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 101a.  Applying the standard set forth by our decision in Strickland, which requires that defense counsel satisfy \xe2\x80\x9can objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 688, the Michigan Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen a defendant proclaims .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. innocence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , it is not objectively unreasonable to recommend that the defendant refrain from pleading guilty\xe2\x80\x94no matter how \xe2\x80\x98good\xe2\x80\x99 the deal may appear.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 102a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent then filed a federal habeas petition under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254.  Applying AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s deferential standard of review, the District Court concluded that the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 ruling was \xe2\x80\x9ccompletely reasonable on the law and the facts\xe2\x80\x9d and denied relief.  No. 07\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9313614, 2010 WL 4115410, *15 (ED Mich., Oct. 19, 2010).  In particular, the District Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ounsel could not be ineffective by trying to negotiate a better plea agreement for [Titlow] with Billie Rogers\xe2\x80\x99s trial imminent and [Titlow] stating at the time that Billie Rogers had committed the murder without .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit reversed.  It found that the factual predicate for the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision\xe2\x80\x94that the withdrawal of the plea was based on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of innocence\xe2\x80\x94was an unreasonable interpretation of the factual record, given Toca\xe2\x80\x99s explanation at the withdrawal hearing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision to withdraw Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s plea was based on the fact that the State\xe2\x80\x99s plea offer was substantially higher than the Michigan guidelines for second-degree murder.\xe2\x80\x9d  680 F. 3d 577, 589 (2012).  Further observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he record in this case contains no evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that Toca fully informed respondent of the possible consequences of withdrawing the guilty plea, the Sixth Circuit held that Toca rendered ineffective assistance of counsel that resulted in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s loss of the benefit of the plea bargain.  Id., at 589\xe2\x80\x93592.  Citing our decision in Lafler v. Cooper, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2012), the Sixth Circuit remanded this case with instructions that the prosecution must reoffer the original plea agreement to respondent, and that the state court should \xe2\x80\x9cconsul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d the plea agreement and \xe2\x80\x9cfashion\xe2\x80\x9d a remedy for the violation of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \n \nSixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel during plea bargaining.  680 F. 3d, at 592.

At the plea hearing, however, respondent balked, refusing to provide a factual basis for the plea which the court could accept.  Respondent admitted to pouring vodka down Don Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 throat, but denied assisting in killing him or knowing that pouring vodka down his throat could lead to his death.  As at trial, respondent testified to attempting to prevent Billie Rogers from harming her husband.  Eventually, after conferring with current counsel (not Toca), respondent admitted to placing Don Rogers in danger by pouring vodka down his throat with the knowledge that his death could result.  The trial court took the plea under advisement, where the matter stands at present.  We granted certiorari.  568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAEDPA instructs that, when a federal habeas petitioner challenges the factual basis for a prior state-court decision rejecting a claim, the federal court may overturn the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision only if it was \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence pre- sented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).

AEDPA likewise imposes a highly deferential standard for reviewing claims of legal error by the state courts:  A writ of habeas corpus may issue only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\xe2\x80\x9d this Court.  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAEDPA recognizes a foundational principle of our fed- eral system:  State courts are adequate forums for the vindi- cation of federal rights.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he States possess sovereignty concurrent with that of the Federal Government, subject only to limitations imposed by the Supremacy Clause.

Hernandez, \n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 434, \n443 (1977)\n.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cstate courts have the solemn responsibility equally with the federal courts to safeguard constitutional rights,\xe2\x80\x9d and this Court has refused to sanction any decision that would \xe2\x80\x9creflec[t] negatively upon [a] state court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

Thereafter, according to an affidavit in the record, respondent discussed the case with a jailer, who advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not in fact guilty.  App. 298 (affidavit of William Pierson).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  That conversation \xe2\x80\x9cset into motion\xe2\x80\x9d respondent\xe2\x80\x99s decision to retain Toca.  Ibid., \xc2\xb68.  Those facts, together with the timing of Toca\xe2\x80\x99s hiring\xe2\x80\x94on the eve of the trial at which respondent was to self-incriminate\xe2\x80\x94strongly suggest that respondent had second thoughts about confessing in open court and proclaimed innocence to Toca.  That conclusion is further bolstered by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s maintenance of innocence of Don Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 death at trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIndeed, reading the record in any other way is difficult.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s first lawyer, Lustig, had negotiated a deal that was quite favorable in light of the fact, admitted by respondent in open court, that the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence could support a conviction for first-degree murder.  This deal involved a guilty plea to manslaughter and a 7- to 15-year sentence\xe2\x80\x94far less than the mandatory sentence of life in prison that results from a conviction for first-degree murder under Michigan law.  See Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. \xc2\xa7750.316 (West Supp. 2013).  Yet after a jailer advised against pleading guilty if respondent was not guilty, something caused respondent both to fire Lustig and hire Toca (who within a few days withdrew the guilty plea), and then to maintain innocence at trial.  If that something was not a desire to assert innocence, it is difficult to imagine what it was, and respondent does not offer an alternative theory.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe only evidence the Sixth Circuit cited for its conclusion that the plea withdrawal was not based on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation of innocence was that, when Toca moved to withdraw the guilty plea, he \xe2\x80\x9cdid not refer to Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s claims of innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9cexplained that the decision to withdraw [the] plea was based on the fact that the State\xe2\x80\x99s plea offer was substantially higher than the Michigan guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d for manslaughter.  680 F. 3d, at 589.  The Sixth Circuit believed that this fact \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently rebuts the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 finding that the plea withdrawal was based on Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of innocence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the Michigan Court of Appeals was well aware of Toca\xe2\x80\x99s representations to the trial court, noting in its opinion that respondent \xe2\x80\x9cmoved to withdraw [the] plea because the agreed upon sentence exceeded the sentencing guidelines range.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 100a.  The Michigan Court of Appeals, however\xe2\x80\x94unlike the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x94also correctly recognized that there is nothing inconsistent about a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s asserting innocence on the one hand and refusing to plead guilty to manslaughter accompanied by higher-than-normal punishment on the other.  Indeed, a defendant convinced of his or her own innocence may have a particularly optimistic view of the likelihood of acquittal, and therefore be more likely to drive a hard bargain with the prosecution before pleading guilty.  Viewing the record as a whole, we conclude that the Sixth Circuit improperly set aside a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable state-court determinatio[n] of fact in favor of its own debatable interpretation of the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rice v. Collins, \n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 333, \n335 (2006)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccepting as true the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 factual determination that respondent proclaimed innocence to Toca, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s Strickland analysis cannot be sustained.  Although a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel gives.  The Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that Toca\xe2\x80\x99s advice satisfied Strickland fell within the bounds of reasonableness under AEDPA, given that respondent was claiming innocence and only days away from offering self-incriminating testimony in open court pursuant to a plea agreement involving an above-guidelines sentence.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Florida v. Nixon, \n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 175, \n187 (2004)\n (explaining that the defendant has the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ultimate authority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to decide whether to accept a plea bargain); Brookhart v. Janis, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n\xe2\x80\x938 (1966) (observing that a lawyer must not \xe2\x80\x9coverride his client\xe2\x80\x99s desire .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to plead not guilty\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion to the contrary was error.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven more troubling is the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Toca was ineffective because the \xe2\x80\x9crecord in this case contains no evidence that\xe2\x80\x9d he gave constitutionally adequate advice on whether to withdraw the guilty plea.  680 F. 3d, at 590.  We have said that counsel should be \xe2\x80\x9cstrongly presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d Strickland, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 690, and that the burden to \xe2\x80\x9cshow that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient\xe2\x80\x9d rests squarely on the defendant, id., at 687.  The Sixth Circuit turned that presumption of effectiveness on its head.  It should go without saying that the absence of evidence cannot overcome the \xe2\x80\x9cstrong presumption that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct [fell] within the wide range of reasonable professional assistance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 689.  As Chief Judge Batchelder correctly explained in her dissent, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithout evidence that Toca gave incorrect advice or evidence that he failed to give material advice, Titlow cannot establish that his performance was deficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  680 F. 3d, at 595.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Sixth Circuit pointed to a single fact in support of its conclusion that Toca failed to adequately advise respondent: his failure to retrieve respondent\xe2\x80\x99s file from Lustig before withdrawing the guilty plea.  Id., at 590.  But here, too, the Sixth Circuit deviated from Strickland\xe2\x80\x99s strong presumption of effectiveness.  The record does not reveal how much Toca was able to glean about respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case from other sources; he may well have obtained copies of the critical materials from prosecutors or the court.  (Indeed, Toca\xe2\x80\x99s statement at the plea withdrawal hearing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here\xe2\x80\x99s a lot of material here\xe2\x80\x9d strongly suggests that he did have access to a source of documentation other than Lustig\xe2\x80\x99s file.  App. 71.)  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the same considerations were relevant to entering and withdrawing the guilty plea, and respondent admitted in open court when initially pleading guilty that Lustig had explained the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence and that this evidence would support a conviction for first-degree murder.  Toca was justified in relying on this admission to conclude that respondent understood the strength of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case and nevertheless wished to withdraw the plea.  With respondent having knowingly entered the guilty plea, we think any confusion about the strength of the State\xe2\x80\x99s evidence upon withdrawing the plea less than a month later highly unlikely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDespite our conclusion that there was no factual or legal justification for overturning the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, we recognize that Toca\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this litigation was far from exemplary.  He may well have violated the rules of professional conduct by accepting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s publication rights as partial payment for his services, and he waited weeks before consulting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s first lawyer about the case.  But the \n \nSixth Amendment does not guarantee the right to perfect counsel; it promises only the right to effective assistance, and we have held that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s violation of ethical norms does not make the lawyer per se ineffective.  See Mickens v. Taylor, \n\n535 U.\xc2\xa0S. 162, \n171 (2002)\n.  Troubling as Toca\xe2\x80\x99s actions were, they were irrelevant to the narrow question that was before the Sixth Circuit: whether the state court reasonably determined that respondent was adequately advised before deciding to withdraw the guilty plea.  Because the Michigan Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision that respondent was so advised is reasonable and supported by the record, the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment is reversed.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Respondent complains that the state court improperly relied on this affidavit, but it was respondent who provided the affidavit to the state court and asked it to rely on the affidavit as part of the ground for remanding for an evidentiary hearing.

As our opinion notes, she bore the burden of overcoming two presumptions: that Toca performed effectively and that the state court ruled correctly.  She failed to carry this burden.  We need not say more, and indeed we do not say more.  I therefore join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in full.  I write separately, however, to express my understanding of our opinion\xe2\x80\x99s limited scope, particularly with respect to two statements that it makes about the adequacy of Toca\xe2\x80\x99s performance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, we state that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities under Strickland, it may affect the advice counsel gives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  The first part of that statement bears emphasis: Regardless of whether a defendant asserts her innocence (or admits her guilt), her counsel must \xe2\x80\x9cmake an independent examination of the facts, circumstances, pleadings and laws involved and then . . . offer his informed opinion as to what plea should be entered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Von Moltke v. Gillies, \n\n332 U. S. 708, \n721 (1948)\n (plurality opinion).  A defendant possesses \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the ultimate authority\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to determine her plea.  Florida v. Nixon, \n\n543 U. S. 175, \n187 (2004)\n.  But a lawyer must abide by his client\xe2\x80\x99s decision in this respect only after having provided the client with competent and fully informed advice, including an analysis of the risks that the client would face in proceeding to trial.  Given our recognition that \xe2\x80\x9ca defendant\xe2\x80\x99s proclamation of innocence does not relieve counsel of his normal responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 8, our further observation that such a proclamation \xe2\x80\x9cmay affect the advice counsel gives,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., states only the obvious: that a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s advice will always reflect the objectives of the representation, as determined by the adequately informed client.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, we state that it was reasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim, \xe2\x80\x9cgiven that respondent was claiming innocence and only days away from offering self-incriminating testimony\xe2\x80\x9d at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  Ante, at 9.  This is true in context: Because respondent failed to carry her burden of showing that Toca\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not adequate, the state court reasonably held that it was.  But our statement about the facts of this case does not imply that an attorney performs effectively in advising his client to withdraw from a plea whenever the client asserts her innocence and has only a few days to make the decision.  Had respondent made a better factual record\xe2\x80\x94had she actually shown, for example, that Toca failed to educate himself about the case before recommending that she withdraw her plea\xe2\x80\x94then she could well have prevailed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause (and only because) respondent failed to present enough evidence to overcome the twin presumptions of AEDPA and Strickland, I join fully in the opinion of the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970777">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93414\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tSHERRY L.

Toca became Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s counsel on the recommendation of the deputy sheriff to whom Titlow professed innocence.  App. 298.  As the Court rightly observes, Toca\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cfar from exemplary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 10.  With virtually no time to make an assessment of Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s chances of prevailing at trial, and without consulting the lawyer who had negotiated Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s plea, Toca told Titlow he could take the case to trial and win.  App. 295 (Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s uncontra- dicted averment).  With Toca\xe2\x80\x99s aid, Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s plea was with- drawn just three days after Toca\xe2\x80\x99s retention as defense counsel.  At sentencing, the prosecutor volunteered that Titlow had been the \xe2\x80\x9cvictim of some bad advice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 291.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNevertheless, one thing is crystal clear.  The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to the plea bargain hinged entirely on Titlow\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to testify at her aunt\xe2\x80\x99s trial.  See App. 42\xe2\x80\x9343, 45.  Once Titlow reneged on that half of the deal, the bargain failed.  Absent an extant bargain, there was nothing to renew.  See Puckett v. United States, \n\n556 U. S. 129, \n137 (2009)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the analogy may not hold in all respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.
