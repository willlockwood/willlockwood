Three and half years after withdrawing from the conspiracy, Gall pleaded guilty to his participation.  A presentence report recommended a sentence of 30 to 37 months in prison, but the District Court sentenced Gall to 36 months\xe2\x80\x99 probation, finding that probation reflected the seriousness of his offense and that imprisonment was unnecessary because his voluntary withdrawal from the conspiracy and postoffense conduct showed that he would not return to criminal behavior and was not a danger to society.  The Eighth Circuit reversed on the ground that a sentence outside the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range must be\xe2\x80\x94and was not in this case\xe2\x80\x94supported by extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0While the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentences\xe2\x80\x94whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.

A district judge must consider the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain the appropriateness of an unusually lenient or harsh sentence with sufficient justifications.  An appellate court may take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines, but it may not require \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances or employ a rigid mathematical formula using a departure\xe2\x80\x99s percentage as the standard for determining the strength of the justification required for a specific sentence.  Such approaches come too close to creating an impermissible unreasonableness presumption for sentences outside the Guidelines range.  The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.  And both approaches reflect a practice of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range, which is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions\xe2\x80\x94whether inside or outside that range.

The Guidelines are the starting point and initial benchmark but are not the only consideration.

He may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable but must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.  If he decides on an outside-the-Guidelines sentence, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of variation.  He must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.  In reviewing the sentence, the appellate court must first ensure that the district court made no significant procedural errors and then consider the sentence\xe2\x80\x99s substantive reasonableness under an abuse-of-discretion standard, taking into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of a variance from the Guidelines range, but must give due deference to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors justify the variance.

The Circuit gave virtually no deference to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that the variance was justified.

UNITED STATES<br/>\n552 U.

The first,<em> Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), involved a sentence <em>within</em> the range recommended by the Federal Sentencing Guidelines; we held that when a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretionary decision in a particular case accords with the sentence the United States Sentencing Commission deems appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cin the mine run of cases,\xe2\x80\x9d the court of appeals may presume that the sentence is reasonable.  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 11).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second case, <em>Claiborne </em>v. <em>United States,</em> involved a sentence <em>below </em>the range recommended by the Guidelines, and raised the converse question whether a court of appeals may apply a \xe2\x80\x9cproportionality test,\xe2\x80\x9d and require that a sentence that constitutes a substantial variance from the Guidelines be justified by extraordinary circumstances.  See <em>Claiborne</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 549 U. S. ___ (2006).  We did not have the opportunity to answer this question because the case was mooted by Claiborne\xe2\x80\x99s untimely death.  <em>Claiborne</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___ (2007) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We granted certiorari in the case before us today in order to reach that question, left unanswered last Term.  551 U. S. ___ (2007).  We now hold that, while the extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range is surely relevant, courts of appeals must review all sentences\xe2\x80\x94whether inside, just outside, or significantly outside the Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x94under a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard.  We also hold that the sentence imposed by the experienced District Judge in this case was reasonable.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In February or March 2000, petitioner Brian Gall, a second-year college student at the University of Iowa, was invited by Luke Rinderknecht to join an ongoing enterprise distributing a controlled substance popularly known as \xe2\x80\x9cecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Gall\xe2\x80\x94who was then a user of ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana\xe2\x80\x94accepted the invitation.  During the ensuing seven months, Gall delivered ecstasy pills, which he received from Rinderknecht, to other conspirators, who then sold them to consumers.  He netted over $30,000.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A month or two after joining the conspiracy, Gall stopped using ecstasy.  A few months after that, in September 2000, he advised Rinderknecht and other co-conspirators that he was withdrawing from the conspiracy.  He has not sold illegal drugs of any kind since.  He has, in the words of the District Court, \xe2\x80\x9cself-rehabilitated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 75.  He graduated from the University of Iowa in 2002, and moved first to Arizona, where he obtained a job in the construction industry, and later to Colorado, where he earned $18 per hour as a master carpenter.  He has not used any illegal drugs since graduating from college.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After Gall moved to Arizona, he was approached by federal law enforcement agents who questioned him about his involvement in the ecstasy distribution conspiracy.  Gall admitted his limited participation in the distribution of ecstasy, and the agents took no further action at that time.  On April 28, 2004\xe2\x80\x94approximately a year and a half after this initial interview, and three and a half years after Gall withdrew from the conspiracy\xe2\x80\x94an indictment was returned in the Southern District of Iowa charging him and seven other defendants with participating in a conspiracy to distribute ecstasy, cocaine, and marijuana, that began in or about May 1996 and continued through October 30, 2002.  The Government has never questioned the truthfulness of any of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s earlier statements or contended that he played any role in, or had any knowledge of, other aspects of the conspiracy described in the indictment.  When he received notice of the indictment, Gall moved back to Iowa and surrendered to the authorities.  While free on his own recognizance, Gall started his own business in the construction industry, primarily engaged in subcontracting for the installation of windows and doors.  In his first year, his profits were over $2,000 per month.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gall entered into a plea agreement with the Government, stipulating that he was \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible for, but did not necessarily distribute himself, at least 2,500 grams of [ecstasy], or the equivalent of at least 87.5 kilograms of marijuana.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.  In the agreement, the Government acknowledged that by \xe2\x80\x9con or about September of 2000,\xe2\x80\x9d Gall had communicated his intent to stop distributing ecstasy to Rinderknecht and other members of the conspiracy.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The agreement further provided that recent changes in the Guidelines that enhanced the recommended punishment for distributing ecstasy were not applicable to Gall because he had withdrawn from the conspiracy prior to the effective date of those changes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In her presentence report, the probation officer concluded that Gall had no significant criminal history; that he was not an organizer, leader, or manager; and that his offense did not involve the use of any weapons.  The report stated that Gall had truthfully provided the Government with all of the evidence he had concerning the alleged offenses, but that his evidence was not useful because he provided no new information to the agents.  The report also described Gall\xe2\x80\x99s substantial use of drugs prior to his offense and the absence of any such use in recent years.  The report recommended a sentencing range of 30 to 37 months of imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The record of the sentencing hearing held on May 27, 2005, includes a \xe2\x80\x9csmall flood\xe2\x80\x9d of letters from Gall\xe2\x80\x99s parents and other relatives, his fianc\xc3\xa9, neighbors, and representatives of firms doing business with him, uniformly praising his character and work ethic.  The transcript includes the testimony of several witnesses and the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s colloquy with the Assistant United States Attorney (AUSA) and with Gall.  The AUSA did not contest any of the evidence concerning Gall\xe2\x80\x99s law-abiding life during the preceding five years, but urged that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Guidelines are appropriate and should be followed,\xe2\x80\x9d and requested that the court impose a prison sentence within the Guidelines range.  <em>Id.</em>, at 93.  He mentioned that two of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s co-conspirators had been sentenced to 30 and 35 months, respectively, but upon further questioning by the District Court, he acknowledged that neither of them had voluntarily withdrawn from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Judge sentenced Gall to probation for a term of 36 months.  In addition to making a lengthy statement on the record, the judge filed a detailed sentencing memorandum explaining his decision, and provided the following statement of reasons in his written judgment:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court determined that, considering all the factors under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. 3553(a), the Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy almost four years before the filing of the Indictment, the Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s post-offense conduct, especially obtaining a college degree and the start of his own successful business, the support of family and friends, lack of criminal history, and his age at the time of the offense conduct, all warrant the sentence imposed, which was sufficient, but not greater than necessary to serve the purposes of sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 117.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the end of both the sentencing hearing and the sentencing memorandum, the District Judge reminded Gall that probation, rather than \xe2\x80\x9can act of leniency,\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial restriction of freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 99, 125.  In the memorandum, he emphasized:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[Gall] will have to comply with strict reporting conditions along with a three-year regime of alcohol and drug testing.  He will not be able to change or make decisions about significant circumstances in his life, such as where to live or work, which are prized liberty interests, without first seeking authorization from his Probation Officer or, perhaps, even the Court.  Of course, the Defendant always faces the harsh consequences that await if he violates the conditions of his probationary term.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 125.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the District Judge explained why he had concluded that the sentence of probation reflected the seriousness of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s offense and that no term of imprisonment was necessary:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAny term of imprisonment in this case would be counter effective by depriving society of the contributions of the Defendant who, the Court has found, understands the consequences of his criminal conduct and is doing everything in his power to forge a new life.  The Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s post-offense conduct indicates neither that he will return to criminal behavior nor that the Defendant is a danger to society.  In fact, the Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s post-offense conduct was not motivated by a desire to please the Court or any other governmental agency, but was the pre-Indictment product of the Defendant\xe2\x80\x99s own desire to lead a better life.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 125\xe2\x80\x93126.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded for resentencing.  Relying on its earlier opinion in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Claiborne, </em>439 F.\xc2\xa03d 479 (CA8 2006), it held that a sentence outside of the Guidelines range must be supported by a justification that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cis proportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d 884, 889 (CA8 2006) (quoting <em>Claiborne,</em> 439 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 481, in turn quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 423, 426\xe2\x80\x93427 (CA7 2005)).  Characterizing the difference between a sentence of probation and the bottom of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s advisory Guidelines range of 30 months as \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d because it amounted to \xe2\x80\x9ca 100% downward variance,\xe2\x80\x9d 446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889, the Court of Appeals held that such a variance must be\xe2\x80\x94and here was not\xe2\x80\x94supported by extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than making an attempt to quantify the value of the justifications provided by the District Judge, the Court of Appeals identified what it regarded as five separate errors in the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning: (1) He gave \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much weight to Gall\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) given that Gall was 21 at the time of his offense, the District Judge erroneously gave \xe2\x80\x9csignificant weight\xe2\x80\x9d to studies showing impetuous behavior by persons under the age of 18; (3) he did not \xe2\x80\x9cproperly weigh\xe2\x80\x9d the seriousness of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s offense; (4) he failed to consider whether a sentence of probation would result in \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted\xe2\x80\x9d disparities; and (5) he placed \xe2\x80\x9ctoo much emphasis on Gall\xe2\x80\x99s post-offense rehabilitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 889\xe2\x80\x93890.  As we shall explain, we are not persuaded that these factors, whether viewed separately or in the aggregate, are sufficient to support the conclusion that the District Judge abused his discretion.  As a preface to our discussion of these particulars, however, we shall explain why the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 rule requiring \xe2\x80\x9cproportional\xe2\x80\x9d justifications for departures from the Guidelines range is not consistent with our remedial opinion in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a> (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Booker </em>we invalidated both the statutory provision, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), which made the Sentencing Guidelines mandatory, and \xc2\xa73742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), which directed appellate courts to apply a <em>de novo </em>standard of review to departures from the Guidelines.  As a result of our decision, the Guidelines are now advisory, and appellate review of sentencing decisions is limited to determining whether they are \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our explanation of \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review in the <em>Booker </em>opinion made it pellucidly clear that the familiar abuse-of-discretion standard of review now applies to appellate review of sentencing decisions.  See 543 U. S., at 260\xe2\x80\x93262; see also <em>Rita</em>, 551 U. S., at ___ (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also clear that a district judge must give serious consideration to the extent of any departure from the Guidelines and must explain his conclusion that an unusually lenient or an unusually harsh sentence is appropriate in a particular case with sufficient justifications.  For even though the Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory, they are, as we pointed out in <em>Rita</em>, the product of careful study based on extensive empirical evidence derived from the review of thousands of individual sentencing decisions.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reviewing the reasonableness of a sentence outside the Guidelines range, appellate courts may therefore take the degree of variance into account and consider the extent of a deviation from the Guidelines.  We reject, however, an appellate rule that requires \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary\xe2\x80\x9d circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines range.  We also reject the use of a rigid mathematical formula that uses the percentage of a departure as the standard for determining the strength of the justifications required for a specific sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the approaches we reject come too close to creating an impermissible presumption of unreasonableness for sentences outside the Guidelines range.  See <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 15) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that we permit courts of appeals to adopt a presumption of reasonableness does not mean that courts may adopt a presumption of unreasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Even the Government has acknowledged that such a presumption would not be consistent with <em>Booker.</em>  See Brief for United States in <em>Rita </em>v.<em> United States</em>, O. T. 2006, No. 06\xe2\x80\x935754, pp. 34\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The mathematical approach also suffers from infirmities of application.  On one side of the equation, deviations from the Guidelines range will always appear more extreme\xe2\x80\x94in percentage terms\xe2\x80\x94when the range itself is low, and a sentence of probation will always be a 100% departure regardless of whether the Guidelines range is 1 month or 100 years.  Moreover, quantifying the variance as a certain percentage of the maximum, minimum, or median prison sentence recommended by the Guidelines gives no weight to the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial restriction of freedom\xe2\x80\x9d involved in a term of supervised release or probation.

App. 109.</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other side of the equation, the mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications.  Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction?  Does it matter that the withdrawal occurred several years ago?  Is it relevant that the withdrawal was motivated by a decision to discontinue the use of drugs and to lead a better life?  What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him?  The formula is a classic example of attempting to measure an inventory of apples by counting oranges.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Most importantly, both the exceptional circumstances requirement and the rigid mathematical formulation reflect a practice\xe2\x80\x94common among courts that have adopted \xe2\x80\x9cproportional review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94of applying a heightened standard of review to sentences outside the Guidelines range.  This is inconsistent with the rule that the abuse-of-discretion standard of review applies to appellate review of all sentencing decisions\xe2\x80\x94whether inside or outside the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>Rita</em>, a district court should begin all sentencing proceedings by correctly calculating the applicable Guidelines range.  See 551 U. S., at ___.  As a matter of administration and to secure nationwide consistency, the Guidelines should be the starting point and the initial benchmark.  The Guidelines are not the only consideration, however.  Accordingly, after giving both parties an opportunity to argue for whatever sentence they deem appropriate, the district judge should then consider all of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors to determine whether they support the sentence requested by a party.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In so doing, he may not presume that the Guidelines range is reasonable.  See <em>id.</em>, at ___.  He must make an individualized assessment based on the facts presented.  If he decides that an outside-Guidelines sentence is warranted, he must consider the extent of the deviation and ensure that the justification is sufficiently compelling to support the degree of the variance.  We find it uncontroversial that a major departure should be supported by a more significant justification than a minor one.  After settling on the appropriate sentence, he must adequately explain the chosen sentence to allow for meaningful appellate review and to promote the perception of fair sentencing.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Regardless of whether the sentence imposed is inside or outside the Guidelines range, the appellate court must review the sentence under an abuse-of-discretion standard.  It must first ensure that the district court committed no significant procedural error, such as failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence\xe2\x80\x94including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.  Assuming that the district court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision is procedurally sound, the appellate court should then consider the substantive reasonableness of the sentence imposed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.  When conducting this review, the court will, of course, take into account the totality of the circumstances, including the extent of any variance from the Guidelines range.  If the sentence is within the Guidelines range, the appellate court may, but is not required to, apply a presumption of reasonableness.  <em>Id.</em>, at ___.  But if the sentence is outside the Guidelines range, the court may not apply a presumption of unreasonableness.  It may consider the extent of the deviation, but must give due deference to the district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.  The fact that the appellate court might reasonably have concluded that a different sentence was appropriate is insufficient to justify reversal of the district court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Practical considerations also underlie this legal principle.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe sentencing judge is in a superior position to find facts and judge their import under \xc2\xa73553(a) in the individual case.  The judge sees and hears the evidence, makes credibility determinations, has full knowledge of the facts and gains insights not conveyed by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Public and Community Defenders et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 16.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe sentencing judge has access to, and greater familiarity with, the individual case and the individual defendant before him than the Commission or the appeals court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rita,</em> 551 U.

Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[d]istrict courts have an institutional advantage over appellate courts in making these sorts of determinations, especially as they see so many more Guidelines sentences than appellate courts do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Koon</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/81/index.html">518 U.

As we shall now explain, the opinion of the Court of Appeals in this case does not reflect the requisite deference and does not support the conclusion that the District Court abused its discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, we note that the District Judge committed no significant procedural error.  He correctly calculated the applicable Guidelines range, allowed both parties to present arguments as to what they believed the appropriate sentence should be, considered all of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, and thoroughly documented his reasoning.  The Court of Appeals found that the District Judge erred in failing to give proper weight to the seriousness of the offense, as required by \xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(A), and failing to consider whether a sentence of probation would create unwarranted disparities, as required by \xc2\xa73553(a)(6).  We disagree.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3553(a)(2)(A) requires judges to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe need for the sentence imposed \xe2\x80\xa6 to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court did not properly weigh the seriousness of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s offense\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cignored the serious health risks ecstasy poses.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890.  Contrary to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion, the District Judge plainly did consider the seriousness of the offense.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> App. 99 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court, however, is bound to impose a sentence that reflects the seriousness of joining a conspiracy to distribute MDMA or ecstasy\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 122.<font super="1"> [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  It is true that the District Judge did not make specific reference to the (unquestionably significant) health risks posed by ecstasy, but the prosecutor did not raise ecstasy\xe2\x80\x99s effects at the sentencing hearing.  Had the prosecutor raised the issue, specific discussion of the point might have been in order, but it was not incumbent on the District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on his own initiative.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate concern that a lenient sentence for a serious offense threatens to promote disrespect for the law is at least to some extent offset by the fact that seven of the eight defendants in this case have been sentenced to significant prison terms.  Moreover, the unique facts of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s situation provide support for the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that, in Gall\xe2\x80\x99s case, \xe2\x80\x9ca sentence of imprisonment may work to promote not respect, but derision, of the law if the law is viewed as merely a means to dispense harsh punishment without taking into account the real conduct and circumstances involved in sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 126.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 3553(a)(6) requires judges to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe need to avoid unwarranted sentence disparities among defendants with similar records who have been found guilty of similar conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals stated that \xe2\x80\x9cthe record does not show that the district court considered whether a sentence of probation would result in unwarranted disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890.  As with the seriousness of the offense conduct, avoidance of unwarranted disparities was clearly considered by the Sentencing Commission when setting the Guidelines ranges.  Since the District Judge correctly calculated and carefully reviewed the Guidelines range, he necessarily gave significant weight and consideration to the need to avoid unwarranted disparities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, as we understand the colloquy between the District Judge and the AUSA, it seems that the judge gave specific attention to the issue of disparity when he inquired about the sentences already imposed by a different judge on two of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s codefendants.  The AUSA advised the District Judge that defendant Harbison had received a 30-month sentence and that Gooding had received 35 months.  The following colloquy then occurred:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT:\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 You probably know more about this than anybody.  How long did those two stay in the conspiracy, and did they voluntarily withdraw?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR GRIESS: They did not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: They did not?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR. GRIESS: They did not voluntarily withdraw.  And they were in the conspiracy, I think, for a shorter period of time, but at the very end.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cTHE COURT: Okay.  Thank you.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cMR. GRIESS: A significant difference there, Your Honor, is that they were in the conspiracy after the guidelines changed and, therefore, were sentenced at a much higher level because of that.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 88.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A little later Mr. Griess stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe last thing I want to talk about goes to sentencing disparity\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Obviously, the Court is cognizant of that and wants to avoid any unwarranted sentencing disparities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 89.  He then discussed at some length the sentence of 36 months imposed on another codefendant, Jarod Yoder, whose participation in the conspiracy was roughly comparable to Gall\xe2\x80\x99s.  Griess voluntarily acknowledged three differences between Yoder and Gall: Yoder was in the conspiracy at its end and therefore was sentenced under the more severe Guidelines, he had a more serious criminal history, and he did not withdraw from the conspiracy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From these facts, it is perfectly clear that the District Judge considered the need to avoid unwarranted disparities, but also considered the need to avoid unwarranted <em>similarities</em> among other co-conspirators who were not similarly situated.  The District Judge regarded Gall\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary withdrawal as a reasonable basis for giving him a less severe sentence than the three codefendants discussed with the AUSA, who neither withdrew from the conspiracy nor rehabilitated themselves as Gall had done.  We also note that neither the Court of Appeals nor the Government has called our attention to a comparable defendant who received a more severe sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the District Court committed no procedural error, the only question for the Court of Appeals was whether the sentence was reasonable\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>,<em> </em>whether the District Judge abused his discretion in determining that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors supported a sentence of probation and justified a substantial deviation from the Guidelines range.  As we shall now explain, the sentence was reasonable.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision to the contrary was incorrect and failed to demonstrate the requisite deference to the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s decision.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals gave virtually no deference to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors justified a significant variance in this case.  Although the Court of Appeals correctly stated that the appropriate standard of review was abuse of discretion, it engaged in an analysis that more closely resembled <em>de novo</em> review of the facts presented and determined that, in its view, the degree of variance was not warranted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thought that the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cgave too much weight to Gall\xe2\x80\x99s withdrawal from the conspiracy because the court failed to acknowledge the significant benefit Gall received from being subject to the 1999 Guidelines.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889.  This criticism is flawed in that it ignores the critical relevance of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary withdrawal, a circumstance that distinguished his conduct not only from that of all his codefendants, but from the vast majority of defendants convicted of conspiracy in federal court.  The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to the fact that Gall voluntarily withdrew from the conspiracy after deciding, on his own initiative, to change his life.  This lends strong support to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Gall is not going to return to criminal behavior and is not a danger to society.  See<em> </em>18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B), (C).  Compared to a case where the offender\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation occurred after he was charged with a crime, the District Court here had greater justification for believing Gall\xe2\x80\x99s turnaround was genuine, as distinct from a transparent attempt to build a mitigation case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thought the District Judge \xe2\x80\x9cgave significant weight to an improper factor\xe2\x80\x9d when he compared Gall\xe2\x80\x99s sale of ecstasy when he was a 21-year-old adult to the \xe2\x80\x9cimpetuous and ill-considered\xe2\x80\x9d actions of persons under the age of 18.  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890.  The appellate court correctly observed that the studies cited by the District Judge do not explain how Gall\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspecific behavior in the instant case was impetuous or ill-considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In that portion of his sentencing memorandum, however, the judge was discussing the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter of the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d not the nature of his offense.  App. 122.  He noted that Gall\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history included a ticket for underage drinking when he was 18 years old and possession of marijuana that was contemporaneous with his offense in this case.  In summary, the District Judge observed that all of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history \xe2\x80\x9cincluding the present offense, occurred when he was twenty-one-years old or younger\xe2\x80\x9d and appeared \xe2\x80\x9cto stem from his addictions to drugs and alcohol.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 123.  The District Judge appended a long footnote to his discussion of Gall\xe2\x80\x99s immaturity.  The footnote includes an excerpt from our opinion in<em> Roper</em> v. <em>Simmons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/551/index.html">543 U. S. 551</a>, 569 (2005), which quotes a study stating that a lack of maturity and an undeveloped sense of responsibility are qualities that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98often result in impetuous and ill-considered actions.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  The District Judge clearly stated the relevance of these studies in the opening and closing sentences of the footnote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cImmaturity at the time of the offense conduct is not an inconsequential consideration.  Recent studies on the development of the human brain conclude that human brain development may not become complete until the age of twenty-five\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [T]he recent [National Institute of Health] report confirms that there is no bold line demarcating at what age a person reaches full maturity.  While age does not excuse behavior, a sentencing court should account for age when inquiring into the conduct of a defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 123, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the dramatic contrast between Gall\xe2\x80\x99s behavior before he joined the conspiracy and his conduct after withdrawing, it was not unreasonable for the District Judge to view Gall\xe2\x80\x99s immaturity at the time of the offense as a mitigating factor, and his later behavior as a sign that he had matured and would not engage in such impetuous and ill-considered conduct in the future.  Indeed, his consideration of that factor finds support in our cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/350/index.html">509 U. S. 350</a>, 367 (1993) (holding that a jury was free to consider a 19-year-old defendant\xe2\x80\x99s youth when determining whether there was a probability that he would continue to commit violent acts in the future and stating that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98youth is more than a chronological fact.  It is a time and condition of life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and to psychological damage\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 115 (1982))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court of Appeals thought that, even if Gall\xe2\x80\x99s rehabilitation was dramatic and permanent, a sentence of probation for participation as a middleman in a conspiracy distributing 10,000 pills of ecstasy \xe2\x80\x9clies outside the range of choice dictated by the facts of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 890.  If the Guidelines were still mandatory, and assuming the facts did not justify a Guidelines-based downward departure, this would provide a sufficient basis for setting aside Gall\xe2\x80\x99s sentence because the Guidelines state that probation alone is not an appropriate sentence for comparable offenses.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  But the Guidelines are not mandatory, and thus the \xe2\x80\x9crange of choice dictated by the facts of the case\xe2\x80\x9d is significantly broadened.  Moreover, the Guidelines are only one of the factors to consider when imposing sentence, and \xc2\xa73553(a)(3) directs the judge to consider sentences other than imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also note that the Government did not argue below, and has not argued here, that a sentence of probation could never be imposed for a crime identical to Gall\xe2\x80\x99s.  Indeed, it acknowledged that probation could be permissible if the record contained different\xe2\x80\x94but in our view, no more compelling\xe2\x80\x94mitigating evidence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (stating that probation could be an appropriate sentence, given the exact same offense, if \xe2\x80\x9cthere are compelling family circumstances where individuals will be very badly hurt in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s family if no one is available to take care of them\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court quite reasonably attached great weight to Gall\xe2\x80\x99s self-motivated rehabilitation, which was undertaken not at the direction of, or under supervision by, any court, but on his own initiative.  This also lends strong support to the conclusion that imprisonment was not necessary to deter Gall from engaging in future criminal conduct or to protect the public from his future criminal acts.  See<em> </em>18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(2)(B), (C).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals clearly disagreed with the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that consideration of the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors justified a sentence of probation; it believed that the circumstances presented here were insufficient to sustain such a marked deviation from the Guidelines range.  But it is not for the Court of Appeals to decide <em>de novo</em> whether the justification for a variance is sufficient or the sentence reasonable.  On abuse-of-discretion review, the Court of Appeals should have given due deference to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoned and reasonable decision that the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, on the whole, justified the sentence.

The fact that \xc2\xa73553(a) explicitly directs sentencing courts to consider the Guidelines supports the premise that district courts must begin their analysis with the Guidelines and remain cognizant of them throughout the sentencing process.</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0District judges sentence, on average, 117 defendants every year.

Whether a sentencing scheme uses mandatory Guidelines, a \xe2\x80\x9cproportionality test\xe2\x80\x9d for Guidelines variances, or a deferential abuse-of-discretion standard, there will be some sentences upheld only on the basis of additional judge-found facts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I continue to believe that substantive-reasonableness review is inherently flawed, I give <em>stare decisis</em> effect to the statutory holding of <em>Rita</em>.  The highly deferential standard adopted by the Court today will result in far fewer unconstitutional sentences than the proportionality standard employed by the Eighth Circuit.  Moreover, as I noted in <em>Rita</em>, the Court has not foreclosed as-applied constitutional challenges to sentences.  The door therefore remains open for a defendant to demonstrate that his sentence, whether inside or outside the advisory Guidelines range, would not have been upheld but for the existence of a fact found by the sentencing judge and not by the jury.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962571">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n552 U.

S. 220</a> (2005), a district court must give the policy decisions that are embodied in the Sentencing Guidelines at least some significant weight in making a sentencing decision.  I would answer that question in the affirmative and would therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Booker, </em>a bare majority held that the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (Sentencing Reform Act), as amended, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73551 <em>et seq.</em>, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991 <em>et seq.</em>, violated the Sixth Amendment insofar as it required district judges to follow the United States Sentencing Guidelines, but another bare majority held that this defect could be remedied by excising the two statutory provisions, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV), that made compliance with the Guidelines mandatory.  As a result of these two holdings, the lower federal courts were instructed that the Guidelines must be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively advisory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 245, and that individual sentencing decisions are subject to appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 262.  The <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion did not explain exactly what it meant by a system of \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory\xe2\x80\x9d guidelines or by \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d review, and the opinion is open to different interpretations.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is possible to read the opinion to mean that district judges, after giving the Guidelines a polite nod, may then proceed essentially as if the Sentencing Reform Act had never been enacted.  This is how two of the dissents interpreted the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Justice Stevens wrote that sentencing judges had \xe2\x80\x9cregain[ed] the unconstrained discretion Congress eliminated in 1984\xe2\x80\x9d when it enacted the Sentencing Reform Act.  <em>Id.,</em> at 297.  Justice Scalia stated that \xe2\x80\x9clogic compels the conclusion that the sentencing judge \xe2\x80\xa6 has full discretion, as full as what he possessed before the Act was passed, to sentence anywhere within the statutory range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 305.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this is a possible understanding of the remedial opinion, a better reading is that sentencing judges must still give the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 policy decisions some significant weight and that the courts of appeals must still police compliance.  In a key passage, the remedial opinion stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0A. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(4), (5) (Supp. 2004). <em> But compare post, at 305 (<font i="1" scaps="1">Scalia, J., dissenting in part) (claiming that the sentencing judge has the same discretion \xe2\x80\x98he possessed before the Act was passed\xe2\x80\x99)</font></em><font i="1" scaps="1">.  The courts of appeals review sentencing decisions for unreasonableness.  These features of the remaining system, while not the system Congress enacted, nonetheless <em>continue to move sentencing in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preferred direction, helping to avoid excessive sentencing disparities</em> while maintaining flexibility sufficient to individualize sentences where necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 264\xe2\x80\x93265 (emphasis added).</font></p><font i="1" scaps="1">\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The implication of this passage is that district courts are still required to give some deference to the policy decisions embodied in the Guidelines and that appellate review must monitor compliance.  District courts must not only \xe2\x80\x9cconsult\xe2\x80\x9d the Guidelines, they must \xe2\x80\x9ctake them into account.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 264.  In addition, the passage distances the remedial majority from Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s position that, under an advisory Guidelines scheme, a district judge would have \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to sentence anywhere within the ranges authorized by statute\xe2\x80\x9d so long as the judge \xe2\x80\x9cstate[d] that \xe2\x80\x98this court does not believe that the punishment set forth in the Guidelines is appropriate for this sort of offense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 305 (opinion dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in the passage quoted above and at other points in the remedial opinion, the Court expressed confidence that appellate review for reasonableness would help to avoid \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98excessive sentencing disparities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwould tend to iron out sentencing differences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 263.  Indeed, a major theme of the remedial opinion, as well as our decision last Term in <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 551 U. S. ___ (2007), was that the post-<em>Booker</em> sentencing regime would still promote the Sentencing Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of reducing sentencing disparities.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 551 U. S., at __ (slip op., at 8), __ (slip op., at 9), __ (slip op., at 15); <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 259\xe2\x80\x93260, 263\xe2\x80\x93264.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is unrealistic to think this goal can be achieved over the long term if sentencing judges need only give lip service to the Guidelines.  The other sentencing factors set out in \xc2\xa73553(a) are so broad that they impose few real restraints on sentencing judges.  See <em>id.,</em> at 305 (Scalia, J., dissenting in part).  Thus, if judges are obligated to do no more than consult the Guidelines before deciding upon the sentence that is, in their independent judgment, sufficient to serve the other \xc2\xa73553(a) factors, federal sentencing will not \xe2\x80\x9cmove \xe2\x80\xa6 in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 preferred direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 264 (opinion of the Court).  On the contrary, sentencing disparities will gradually increase.  Appellate decisions affirming sentences that diverge from the Guidelines (such as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today) will be influential, and the sentencing habits developed during the pre-<em>Booker </em>era will fade.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in reading the <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion, we should not forget the decision\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional underpinnings.  <em>Booker </em>and its antecedents are based on the Sixth Amendment right to trial by jury.  The Court has held that (at least under a mandatory guidelines system) a defendant has the right to have a jury, not a judge, find facts that increase the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s authorized sentence.  See <em>id.,</em> at 230\xe2\x80\x93232; <em>Blakely</em> v.<em> Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, 303\xe2\x80\x93304 (2004).  It is telling that the rules set out in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in the present case have nothing to do with juries or factfinding and, indeed, that not one of the facts that bears on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence is disputed.  What is at issue, instead, is the allocation of the authority to decide issues of substantive sentencing policy, an issue on which the Sixth Amendment says absolutely nothing.  The yawning gap between the Sixth Amendment and the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion should be enough to show that the <em>Blakely-Booker</em> line of cases has gone astray.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Blakely</em>, the Court drew a distinction\xe2\x80\x94between judicial factfinding under a guidelines system and judicial factfinding under a discretionary sentencing system, see<em> </em>542 U. S., at 309\xe2\x80\x93310\xe2\x80\x94that, in my judgment, cannot be defended as a matter of principle.  It would be a coherent principle to hold that any fact that increases a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence beyond the minimum required by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict of guilt must be found by a jury.  Such a holding, however, would clash with accepted sentencing practice at the time of the adoption of the Sixth Amendment.  By that time, many States had enacted criminal statutes that gave trial judges the discretion to select a sentence from within a prescribed range,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and the First Congress enacted federal criminal statutes that were cast in this mold.  See An Act for the Punishment of certain Crimes against the United States, 1 Stat. 112.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a sentencing system of this type, trial judges inevitably make findings of fact (albeit informally) that increase sentences beyond the minimum required by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  For example, under a statute providing that the punishment for burglary is, say, imprisonment for up to <em>x</em> years, the sentencing court might increase the sentence that it would have otherwise imposed by some amount based on evidence introduced at trial that the defendant was armed or that, before committing the crime, the defendant had told a confederate that he would kill the occupants if they awakened during the burglary.  The only difference between this sort of factfinding and the type that occurs under a guidelines system is that factfinding under a guidelines system is explicit and the effect of each critical finding is quantified.  But in both instances, facts that cause a defendant to spend more time in prison are found by judges, not juries, and therefore no distinction can be drawn as a matter of Sixth Amendment principle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of this distinction also produced strange collateral consequences.  A sentencing system that gives trial judges the discretion to sentence within a specified range not only permits judicial factfinding that may increase a sentence, such a system also gives individual judges discretion to implement their own sentencing policies.  This latter feature, whether wise or unwise, has nothing to do with the concerns of the Sixth Amendment, and a principal objective of the Sentencing Reform Act was to take this power out of the hands of individual district judges.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Booker</em> remedy, however, undid this congressional choice.  In curing the Sentencing Reform Act\xe2\x80\x99s perceived defect regarding judicial factfinding, <em>Booker</em> restored to the district courts at least a measure of the policymaking authority that the Sentencing Reform Act had taken away.  (How much of this authority was given back is, of course, the issue here.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that the Court is committed to the <em>Blakely-Booker</em> line of cases, but we are not required to continue along a path that will take us further and further off course.  Because the <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion may be read to require sentencing judges to give weight to the Guidelines, I would adopt that interpretation and thus minimize the gap between what the Sixth Amendment requires and what our cases have held.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Read fairly, the opinion of the Court of Appeals holds that the District Court did not properly exercise its sentencing discretion because it did not give sufficient weight to the policy decisions reflected in the Guidelines.  Petitioner was convicted of a serious crime, conspiracy to distribute \xe2\x80\x9cecstasy.\xe2\x80\x9d  He distributed thousands of pills and made between $30,000 and $40,000 in profit.  Although he eventually left the conspiracy, he did so because he was worried about apprehension.  The Sentencing Guidelines called for a term of imprisonment of 30 to 37 months, but the District Court imposed a term of probation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Compelled to interpret the <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion, the District Court, it appears, essentially chose the interpretation outlined in Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 and Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s dissents.  The District Court considered the sentence called for by the Guidelines, but I see no evidence that the District Court deferred to the Guidelines to any significant degree.  Rather, the court determined what it thought was appropriate under the circumstances and sentenced petitioner accordingly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the question before us was whether a reasonable jurist could conclude that a sentence of probation was sufficient in this case to serve the purposes of punishment set out in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a)(2), the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision could not be disturbed.  But because I believe that sentencing judges must still give some significant weight to the Guidelines sentencing range, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities, \xc2\xa73553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V), I agree with the Eighth Circuit that the District Court did not properly exercise its discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellate review for abuse of discretion is not an empty formality.  A decision calling for the exercise of judicial discretion \xe2\x80\x9chardly means that it is unfettered by meaningful standards or shielded from thorough appellate review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73553(a)(3), (4), and (5) (2000 ed. and Supp. V)\xe2\x80\x94namely, the Guidelines sentencing range, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statements, and the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities.  Although the Guidelines called for a prison term of at least 30 months, the District Court did not require any imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94not one day.  The opinion of the Court makes much of the restrictions and burdens of probation, see <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, but in the real world there is a huge difference between imprisonment and probation.  If the District Court had given any appreciable weight to the Guidelines, the District Court could not have sentenced petitioner to probation without very strong countervailing considerations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court listed five considerations as justification for a sentence of probation: (1) petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) his \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary behavior while on bond,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthe support manifested by family and friends,\xe2\x80\x9d (4) \xe2\x80\x9cthe lack of criminal history, especially a complete lack of any violent criminal history,\xe2\x80\x9d (5) and his age at the time of the offense, 21.  App. 97.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two of the considerations that the District Court cited\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe support manifested by family and friends\xe2\x80\x9d and his age, <em>ibid.</em>\xe2\x80\x94amounted to a direct rejection of the Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s authority to decide the most basic issues of sentencing policy.  In the Sentencing Reform Act, Congress required the Sentencing Commission to consider and decide whether certain specified factors\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ceducation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprevious employment record,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cphysical condition,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfamily ties and responsibilities,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity ties\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chave any relevance to the nature [and] extent\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 of an appropriate sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994(d).  These factors come up with great frequency, and judges in the pre-Sentencing Reform Act era disagreed regarding their relevance.  Indeed, some of these factors were viewed by some judges as reasons for increasing a sentence and by others as reasons for decreasing a sentence.  For example, if a defendant had a job, a supportive family, and friends, those factors were sometimes viewed as justifying a harsher sentence on the ground that the defendant had squandered the opportunity to lead a law-abiding life.  Alternatively, those same factors were sometimes viewed as justifications for a more lenient sentence on the ground that a defendant with a job and a network of support would be less likely to return to crime.  If each judge is free to implement his or her personal views on such matters, sentencing disparities are inevitable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In response to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 direction to establish uniform national sentencing policies regarding these common sentencing factors, the Sentencing Commission issued policy statements concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cage,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfamily ties,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccommunity ties\xe2\x80\x9d are relevant to sentencing only in unusual cases.  See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa75H1.1 (age), 5H1.6 (family and community ties) (Nov. 2006).  The District Court in this case did not claim that there was anything particularly unusual about petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s family or community ties or his age, but the court cited these factors as justifications for a sentence of probation.  Although the District Court was obligated to take into account the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policy statements and the need to avoid sentencing disparities, the District Court rejected Commission policy statements that are critical to the effort to reduce such disparities.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court relied on petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s lack of criminal history, but criminal history (or the lack thereof) is a central factor in the calculation of the Guidelines range.  Petitioner was given credit for his lack of criminal history in the calculation of his Guidelines sentence.  Consequently, giving petitioner additional credit for this factor was nothing more than an expression of disagreement with the policy determination reflected in the Guidelines range.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court mentioned petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexemplary behavior while on bond,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 97, but this surely cannot be regarded as a weighty factor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the District Court was plainly impressed by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntary and explicit withdrawal from the conspiracy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  As the Government argues, the legitimate strength of this factor is diminished by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motivation in withdrawing.  He did not leave the conspiracy for reasons of conscience, and he made no effort to stop the others in the ring.  He withdrew because he had become afraid of apprehension.  446 F. 3d 884, 886 (CA8 2006).  While the District Court was within its rights\nin regarding this factor and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cself-rehabilitat[ion],\xe2\x80\x9d App. 75, as positive considerations, they are not enough, in light of the Guidelines\xe2\x80\x99 call for a 30- to 37-month prison term, to warrant a sentence of probation.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court attacks straw men.  The Court unjustifiably faults the Eighth Circuit for using what it characterizes as a \xe2\x80\x9crigid mathematical formula.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  The Eighth Circuit (following a Seventh Circuit opinion) stated that a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s justifications for a sentence outside the Guidelines range must be \xe2\x80\x9cproportional to the extent of the difference between the advisory range and the sentence imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 889 (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Claiborne</em>, 439 F.\xc2\xa03d 479, 481 (CA8 2006), in turn quoting<em> United States </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, 427 F.\xc2\xa03d 423, 426\xe2\x80\x93427 (CA7 2005); internal quotation marks omitted).  Taking this language literally as requiring a mathematical computation, the Court has an easy time showing that mathematical precision is not possible:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he mathematical approach assumes the existence of some ascertainable method of assigning percentages to various justifications.  Does withdrawal from a conspiracy justify more or less than, say, a 30% reduction? \xe2\x80\xa6 What percentage, if any, should be assigned to evidence that a defendant poses no future threat to society, or to evidence that innocent third parties are dependent on him?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This criticism is quite unfair.  It is apparent that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits did not mean to suggest that proportionality review could be reduced to a mathematical equation, and certainly the Eighth Circuit in this case did not assign numbers to the various justifications offered by the District Court.  All that the Seventh and Eighth Circuits meant, I am convinced, is what this Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion states, <em>i.e.</em>, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent of the difference between a particular sentence and the recommended Guidelines range\xe2\x80\x9d is a relevant consideration in determining whether the District Court properly exercised its sentencing discretion.  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is also wrong in suggesting that the Eighth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s approach was inconsistent with the abuse-of-discretion standard of appellate review.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  The Eighth Circuit stated unequivocally that it was conducting abuse-of-discretion review, 446 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 888\xe2\x80\x93889; abuse-of-discretion review is not toothless; and it is entirely proper for a reviewing court to find an abuse of discretion when important factors\xe2\x80\x94in this case, the Guidelines, policy statements, and the need to avoid sentencing disparities\xe2\x80\x94are \xe2\x80\x9cslighted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, 487 U. S., at 337.  The mere fact that the Eighth Circuit reversed is hardly proof that the Eighth Circuit did not apply the correct standard of review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I believe that the Eighth Circuit correctly interpreted and applied the standards set out in the <em>Booker</em> remedial opinion, I must respectfully dissent.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To take some examples, Connecticut, as of 1784, punished burglary and robbery without violence with imprisonment of up to 10 years \xe2\x80\x9cat the Discretion of the Superior Court before whom the Conviction is had.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Acts and Laws of the State of Connecticut 18 (1784).
