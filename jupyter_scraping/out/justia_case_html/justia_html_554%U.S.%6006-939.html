The District Court granted the plaintiffs partial summary judgment, holding that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) pre-empts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2 and 16645.7 because they regulate employer speech about union organizing under circumstances in which Congress intended free debate.

In 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act amended the NLRA by, among other things, adding \xc2\xa78(c), which protects from National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) regulation noncoercive speech by both unions and employers about labor organizing.  The section both responded to prior NLRB rulings that employers\xe2\x80\x99 attempts to persuade employees not to organize amounted to coercion prohibited as an unfair labor practice by the previous version of \xc2\xa78 and manifested a \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Linn</em> v. <em>Plant Guard Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/index.html">383 U.

Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645\xe2\x80\x9316649 (West Supp. 2008).  The question presented to us is whether two of its provisions\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa716645.2, applicable to grant recipients, and \xc2\xa716645.7, applicable to private employers receiving more than $10,000 in program funds in any year\xe2\x80\x94are pre-empted by federal law mandating that certain zones of labor activity be unregulated.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As set forth in the preamble, the State of California enacted AB 1889 for the following purpose:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the policy of the state not to interfere with an employee\xe2\x80\x99s choice about whether to join or to be represented by a labor union.  For this reason, the state should not subsidize efforts by an employer to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.  It is the intent of the Legislature in enacting this act to prohibit an em-\nployer from using state funds and facilities for the purpose of influencing employees to support or oppose unionization and to prohibit an employer from seeking to influence employees to support or oppose unionization while those employees are performing work on a state contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \xc2\xa71.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0AB 1889 forbids certain employers that receive state funds\xe2\x80\x94whether by reimbursement, grant, contract, use of state property, or pursuant to a state program\xe2\x80\x94from using such funds to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.1 to 16645.7.  This prohibition encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cany attempt by an employer to influence the decision of its employees\xe2\x80\x9d regarding \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether to support or oppose a labor organization\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether to become a member of any labor organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716645(a).  The statute specifies that the spending restriction applies to \xe2\x80\x9cany expense, including legal and consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and employees, incurred for . . . an activity to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716646(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite the neutral statement of policy quoted above, AB 1889 expressly exempts \xe2\x80\x9cactivit[ies] performed\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cexpense[s] incurred\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with certain undertakings that promote unionization, including \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llowing a labor organization or its representatives access to the employer\xe2\x80\x99s facilities or property,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]egotiating, entering into, or carrying out a voluntary recognition agreement with a labor organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716647(b), (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To ensure compliance with the grant and program restrictions at issue in this case, AB 1889 establishes a formidable enforcement scheme.  Covered employers must certify that no state funds will be used for prohibited expenditures; the employer must also maintain and provide upon request \xe2\x80\x9crecords sufficient to show that no state funds were used for those expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2(c), 16645.7(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  If an employer commingles state and other funds, the statute presumes that any expenditures to assist, promote, or deter union organizing derive in part from state funds on a pro\xc2\xa0rata basis.  \xc2\xa716646(b).  Violators are liable to the State for the amount of funds used for prohibited purposes plus a civil penalty equal to twice the amount of those funds.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2(d), 16645.7(d).  Suspected violators may be sued by the state attorney general or any private taxpayer, and prevailing plaintiffs are \xe2\x80\x9centitled to recover reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716645.8(d).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In April 2002, several organizations whose members do business with the State of California (collectively, Chamber of Commerce), brought this action against the California Department of Health Services and appropriate state officials (collectively, the State) to enjoin enforcement of AB 1889.  Two labor unions (collectively, AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO) intervened to defend the statute\xe2\x80\x99s validity.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted partial summary judgment in favor of the Chamber of Commerce,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] holding that the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), 49 Stat. 449, as amended, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7151 <em>et seq. </em>pre-empts Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716645.2 (concerning grants) and \xc2\xa716645.7 (concerning program funds) because those provisions \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[e] employer speech about union organizing under specified circumstances, even though Congress intended free debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Lockyer</em>, 225 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1199, 1205 (CD Cal. 2002).  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, after twice affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, granted rehearing en banc and reversed.  See <em>Chamber of Commerce </em>v. <em>Lockyer</em>, 463 F.\xc2\xa03d 1076, 1082 (2006).  While the en banc majority agreed that California enacted \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2 and 16645.7 in its capacity as a regulator, and not as a mere proprietor or market participant, see <em>id.</em>, at 1082\xe2\x80\x931085, it concluded that Congress did not intend to preclude States from imposing such restrictions on the use of their own funds, see <em>id.</em>, at 1085\xe2\x80\x931096.  We granted certiorari, 552 U. S. ___ (2007), and now reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Although the NLRA itself contains no express pre-emption provision, we have held that Congress implicitly mandated two types of pre-emption as necessary to implement federal labor policy.  The first, known as <em>Garmon</em> pre-emption, see <em>San Diego Building Trades Council</em> v. <em>Garmon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/359/236/index.html">359 U. S. 236</a> (1959), \xe2\x80\x9cis intended to preclude state interference with the National Labor Relations Board\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation and active enforcement of the \xe2\x80\x98integrated scheme of regulation\xe2\x80\x99 established by the NLRA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Golden State Transit Corp.</em> v. <em>Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/608/index.html">475 U. S. 608</a>, 613 (1986) <em>(Golden State I)</em>.  To this end, <em>Garmon </em>pre-emption forbids States to \xe2\x80\x9cregulate activity that the NLRA protects, prohibits, or arguably protects or prohibits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Industry</em> v. <em>Gould Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/282/index.html">475 U. S. 282</a>, 286 (1986).  The second, known as <em>Machinists </em>pre-emption, forbids both the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and States to regulate conduct that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cbe unregulated because left \xe2\x80\x98to be controlled by the free play of economic forces.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Machinists</em> v. <em>Wisconsin Employment Relations Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/132/index.html">427 U. S. 132</a>, 140 (1976) (quoting <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Nash-Finch Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/138/index.html">404 U. S. 138</a>, 144 (1971)).  <em>Machinists </em>pre-emption is based on the premise that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Congress struck a balance of protection, prohibition, and laissez-faire in respect to union organization, collective bargaining, and labor disputes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  427 U. S., at 140, n.\xc2\xa04 (quoting Cox, Labor Law Preemption Revisited, 85 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1337, 1352 (1972)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today we hold that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2 and 16645.7 are pre-empted under <em>Machinists</em> because they regulate within \xe2\x80\x9ca zone protected and reserved for market freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em> v. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/218/index.html">507 U. S. 218</a>, 227 (1993) <em>(Boston Harbor)</em>.  We do not reach the question whether the provisions would also be pre-empted under <em>Garmon</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As enacted in 1935, the NLRA, which was commonly known as the Wagner Act, did not include any provision that specifically addressed the intersection between employee organizational rights and employer speech rights.  See 49 Stat. 449.  Rather, it was left to the NLRB, subject to review in federal court, to reconcile these interests in its construction of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77 and 8.  Section 7, now codified at 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157, provided that workers have the right to organize, to bargain collectively, and to engage in concerted activity for their mutual aid and protection.  Section 8(1), now codified at 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7158(a)(1), made it an \xe2\x80\x9cunfair labor practice\xe2\x80\x9d for employers to \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of the rights guaranteed by section 7.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Among the frequently litigated issues under the Wagner Act were charges that an employer\xe2\x80\x99s attempts to persuade employees not to join a union\xe2\x80\x94or to join one favored by the employer rather than a rival\xe2\x80\x94amounted to a form of coercion prohibited by \xc2\xa78.  The NLRB took the position that \xc2\xa78 demanded complete employer neutrality during organizing campaigns, reasoning that any partisan employer speech about unions would interfere with the \xc2\xa77 rights of employees.  See 1 J. Higgins, The Developing Labor Law 94 (5th ed. 2006).  In 1941, this Court curtailed the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s aggressive interpretation, clarifying that nothing in the NLRA prohibits an employer \xe2\x80\x9cfrom expressing its view on labor policies or problems\xe2\x80\x9d unless the employer\xe2\x80\x99s speech \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with other circumstances [amounts] to coercion within the meaning of the Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Virginia Elec. &amp; Power Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/314/469/index.html">314 U. S. 469</a>, 477 (1941).  We subsequently characterized <em>Virginia Electric</em> as recognizing the First Amendment right of employers to engage in noncoercive speech about unionization.  <em>Thomas</em> v. <em>Collins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/516/index.html">323 U. S. 516</a>, 537\xe2\x80\x93538 (1945).  Notwithstanding these decisions, the NLRB continued to regulate employer speech too restrictively in the eyes of Congress. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Concerned that the Wagner Act had pushed the labor relations balance too far in favor of unions, Congress passed the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Taft-Hartley Act).  61 Stat. 136.  The Taft-Hartley Act amended \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77 and 8 in several key respects.  First, it emphasized that employees \xe2\x80\x9chave the right to refrain from any or all\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77 activities.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7157.  Second, it added \xc2\xa78(b), which prohibits unfair labor practices by unions. 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7158(b).  Third, it added \xc2\xa78(c), which protects speech by both unions and employers from regulation\nby the NLRB.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7158(c).  Specifically, \xc2\xa78(c) provides:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe expressing of any views, argument, or opinion, or the dissemination thereof, whether in written, printed, graphic, or visual form, shall not constitute or be evidence of an unfair labor practice under any of the provisions of this subchapter, if such expression contains no threat of reprisal or force or promise of benefit.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From one vantage, \xc2\xa78(c) \xe2\x80\x9cmerely implements the First Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>NLRB</em> v. <em>Gissel Packing Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/575/index.html">395 U. S. 575</a>, 617 (1969), in that it responded to particular constitutional rulings of the NLRB.  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 105, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., pt. 2, pp. 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (1947).  But its enactment also manifested a \xe2\x80\x9ccongressional intent to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Linn</em> v. <em>Plant Guard Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/index.html">383 U. S. 53</a>, 62 (1966).  It is indicative of how important Congress deemed such \xe2\x80\x9cfree debate\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress amended the NLRA rather than leaving to the courts the task of correcting the NLRB\xe2\x80\x99s decisions on a case-by-case basis.  We have characterized this policy judgment, which suffuses the NLRA as a whole, as \xe2\x80\x9cfavoring uninhibited, robust, and wide-open debate in labor disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d stressing that \xe2\x80\x9cfreewheeling use of the written and spoken word . . . has been expressly fostered by Congress and approved by the NLRB.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Letter Carriers</em> v. <em>Austin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/264/index.html">418 U. S. 264</a>, 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (1974).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express protection of free debate forcefully buttresses the pre-emption analysis in this case.  Under <em>Machinists</em>, congressional intent to shield a zone of activity from regulation is usually found only \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit[ly] in the structure of the Act,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Livadas</em> v. <em>Bradshaw</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/107/index.html">512 U. S. 107</a>, 117, n.\xc2\xa011 (1994), drawing on the notion that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]hat Congress left unregulated is as important as the regulations that it imposed,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Golden State Transit Corp.</em> v. <em>Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/493/103/index.html">493 U. S. 103</a>, 110 (1989) <em>(Golden State II)</em> (quoting <em>New York Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>New York State Dept. of Labor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/519/index.html">440 U. S. 519</a>, 552 (1979) (Powell, J., dissenting)).  In the case of noncoercive speech, however, the protection is both implicit and explicit.  Sections 8(a) and 8(b) demonstrate that when Congress has sought to put limits on advocacy for or against union organization, it has expressly set forth the mechanisms for doing so.  Moreover, the amendment to \xc2\xa77 calls attention to the right of employees to refuse to join unions, which implies an underlying right to receive information opposing unionization.

We explained that when a State acts as a \xe2\x80\x9cmarket participant with no interest in setting policy,\xe2\x80\x9d as opposed to a \xe2\x80\x9cregulator,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not offend the pre-emption principles of the NLRA.  507 U.

In finding that the state agency had acted as a market participant, we stressed that the challenged action \xe2\x80\x9cwas specifically tailored to one particular job,\xe2\x80\x9d and aimed \xe2\x80\x9cto ensure an efficient project that would be completed as quickly and effectively as possible at the lowest cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 232.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is beyond dispute that California enacted AB 1889 in its capacity as a regulator rather than a market participant.  AB 1889 is neither \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically tailored to one particular job\xe2\x80\x9d nor a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate response to state procurement constraints or to local economic needs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gould</em>, 475 U. S., at 291.  As the statute\xe2\x80\x99s preamble candidly acknowledges, the legislative purpose is not the efficient procurement of goods and services, but the furtherance of a labor policy.  See 2000 Cal. Stats. ch. 872, \xc2\xa71.  Although a State has a legitimate proprietary interest in ensuring that state funds are spent in accordance with the purposes for which they are appropriated, this is not the objective of AB 1889.  In contrast to a neutral affirmative requirement that funds be spent solely for the purposes of the relevant grant or program, AB 1889 imposes a targeted negative restriction on employer speech about unionization.  Furthermore, the statute does not even apply this constraint uniformly.  Instead of forbidding the use of state funds for <em>all </em>employer advocacy regarding unionization, AB 1889 permits use of state funds for <em>select</em> employer advocacy activities that promote unions.  Specifically, the statute exempts expenses incurred in connection with, <em>inter alia</em>, giving unions access to the workplace, and voluntarily recognizing unions without a secret ballot election.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716647(b), (d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that although California did not act as a market participant in enacting AB 1889, the NLRA did not pre-empt the statute.  It purported to distinguish <em>Gould</em> on the theory that AB 1889 does not make employer neutrality a condition for <em>receiving </em>funds, but instead restricts only the <em>use </em>of funds.  According to the Court of Appeals, this distinction matters because when a State imposes a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d restriction instead of a \xe2\x80\x9creceipt\xe2\x80\x9d restriction, \xe2\x80\x9can employer has and retains the freedom to spend its own funds however it wishes.\xe2\x80\x9d  463 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1088.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d restriction rather than a \xe2\x80\x9creceipt\xe2\x80\x9d restriction is, at least in this case, no more consequential than Wisconsin\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on its spending power rather than its police power in <em>Gould</em>.  As explained below, AB 1889 couples its \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d restriction with compliance costs and litigation risks that are calculated to make union-related advocacy prohibitively expensive for employers that receive state funds.  By making it exceedingly difficult for employers to demonstrate that they have not used state funds and by imposing punitive sanctions for noncompliance, AB 1889 effectively reaches beyond \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of funds over which California maintains a sovereign interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 19.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning first to the compliance burdens, AB 1889 requires recipients to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain records sufficient to show that no state funds were used\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibited expenditures, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2(c), 16645.7(c), and conclusively presumes that any expenditure to assist, promote, or deter union organizing made from \xe2\x80\x9ccommingled\xe2\x80\x9d funds constitutes a violation of the statute, \xc2\xa716646(b).  Maintaining \xe2\x80\x9csufficient\xe2\x80\x9d records and ensuring segregation of funds is no small feat, given that AB 1889 expansively defines its prohibition to encompass \xe2\x80\x9cany expense\xe2\x80\x9d incurred in \xe2\x80\x9cany<em> </em>attempt\xe2\x80\x9d by an employer to \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence the decision of its employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645(a), 16646(a).  Prohibited expenditures include not only discrete expenses such as legal and consulting fees, but also an allocation of overhead, including \xe2\x80\x9csalaries of supervisors and employees,\xe2\x80\x9d for any time and resources spent on union-related advocacy.  See \xc2\xa716646(a).  The statute affords no clearly defined safe harbor, save for expenses incurred in connection with activities that either favor unions or are required by federal or state law.  See \xc2\xa716647.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute also imposes deterrent litigation risks.  Significantly, AB 1889 authorizes not only the California Attorney General but also any private taxpayer\xe2\x80\x94including, of course, a union in a dispute with an employer\xe2\x80\x94to bring a civil action against suspected violators for \xe2\x80\x9cinjunctive relief, damages, civil penalties, and other appropriate equitable relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa716645.8.  Violators are liable to the State for three times the amount of state funds deemed spent on union organizing.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2(d), 16645.7(d), 16645.8(a).  Prevailing plaintiffs, and certain prevailing taxpayer intervenors, are entitled to recover attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, \xc2\xa716645.8(d), which may well dwarf the treble damages award.  Consequently, a trivial violation of the statute could give rise to substantial liability.  Finally, even if an employer were confident that it had satisfied the recordkeeping and segregation requirements, it would still bear the costs of defending itself against unions in court, as well as the risk of a mistaken adverse finding by the factfinder.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these burdens, California\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d restriction rather than a \xe2\x80\x9creceipt\xe2\x80\x9d restriction \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not significantly lessen the inherent potential for conflict\xe2\x80\x9d between AB 1889 and the NLRA.  <em>Gould</em>, 475 U. S., at 289.  AB 1889\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement mechanisms put considerable pressure on an employer either to forgo his \xe2\x80\x9cfree speech right to communicate his views to his employees,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gissel Packing</em>, 395 U. S., at 617, or else to refuse the receipt of any state funds.  In so doing, the statute impermissibly \xe2\x80\x9cpredicat[es] benefits on refraining from conduct protected by federal labor law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Livadas</em>,<em> </em>512 U. S., at 116, and chills one side of \xe2\x80\x9cthe robust debate which has been protected under the NLRA,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Letter Carriers</em>, 418 U. S., at 275.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resisting this conclusion, the State and the AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO contend that AB 1889 imposes less onerous recordkeeping restrictions on governmental subsidies than do federal restrictions that have been found not to violate the First Amendment.  See <em>Rust</em> v. <em>Sullivan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/173/index.html">500 U.

The question, however, is not whether AB 1889 violates the First Amendment, but whether it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the NLRA.  <em>Livadas</em>, 512 U.

In my view, they do not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The operative sections of the California statute provide that employers who wish to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote or deter union organizing,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot use state money when they do so.  The majority finds these provisions pre-empted because in its view the sections regulate employer speech in a manner that weakens, or undercuts, a congressional policy, embodied in NLRA \xc2\xa78(c), \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to encourage free debate on issues dividing labor and management.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (citing <em>Linn</em> v. <em>Plant Guard Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/53/index.html">383 U. S. 53</a>, 62 (1966)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although I agree the congressional policy favors \xe2\x80\x9cfree debate,\xe2\x80\x9d I do not believe the operative provisions of the California statute amount to impermissible regulation that interferes with that policy as Congress intended it.  First, the only relevant Supreme Court case that found a State\xe2\x80\x99s labor-related spending limitations to be pre-empted differs radically from the case before us. In that case, <em>Wisconsin Dept. of Industry</em> v. <em>Gould Inc.</em>, 475 U. S.<em> </em>282, the Court considered a Wisconsin statute that prohibited the State from doing business with firms that repeatedly violated the NLRA.  The Court said that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmanifest purpose and inevitable effect\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cto enforce\xe2\x80\x9d the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, which \xe2\x80\x9crole Congress reserved exclusively for the [National Labor Relations Board].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 291.  In a word, the Wisconsin statute sought \xe2\x80\x9cto <em>compel</em> conformity with the NLRA.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Building &amp; Constr. Trades Council</em> v. <em>Associated Builders &amp; Contractors of Mass./R. I., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/218/index.html">507 U. S. 218</a>, 228 (1993) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s statute differs from the Wisconsin statute because it does not seek to compel labor-related activity.  Nor does it seek to forbid labor-related activity.  It permits all employers who receive state funds to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  It simply says to those employers, do not do so on our dime.  I concede that a federal law that forces States to pay for labor-related speech from public funds would encourage <em>more</em> of that speech.  But no one can claim that the NLRA is such a law.  And without such a law, a State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay for labor-related speech does not <em>impermissibly</em> discourage that activity.  To refuse to pay for an activity (as here) is not the same as to compel others to engage in that activity (as in <em>Gould</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, California\xe2\x80\x99s operative language does not weaken or undercut Congress\xe2\x80\x99 policy of \xe2\x80\x9cencourag[ing] free debate on issues dividing labor and management.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Linn</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 62.  For one thing, employers remain free to spend <em>their own</em> money to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter\xe2\x80\x9d unionization.  More importantly, I cannot conclude that California\xe2\x80\x99s statute would weaken or undercut any such congressional policy because Congress itself has enacted three statutes that, <em>using identical language,</em> do precisely the same thing.  Congress has forbidden recipients of Head Start funds from using the funds to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79839(e).  It has forbidden recipients of Workforce Investment Act of 1998 funds from using the funds to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72931(b)(7).  And it has forbidden recipients of National Community Service Act of 1990 funds from using the funds to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter union organizing.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712634(b)(1).  Could Congress have thought that the NLRA would prevent the States from enacting the very same kinds of laws that Congress itself has enacted?  Far more likely, Congress thought that directing government funds away from labor-related activity was <em>consistent</em>, not <em>inconsistent</em>, with, the policy of \xe2\x80\x9cencourag[ing] free debate\xe2\x80\x9d embedded in its labor statutes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the law normally gives legislatures broad authority to decide how to spend the People\xe2\x80\x99s money.  A legislature, after all, generally has the right <em>not</em> to fund activities that it would prefer not to fund\xe2\x80\x94even where the activities are otherwise protected.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Wash.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/index.html">461 U. S. 540</a>, 549 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have held in several contexts that a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has made the same point in the context of labor law.  See <em>Lyng</em> v. <em>Automobile Workers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/360/index.html">485 U. S. 360</a>, 368 (1988) (holding that the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to provide food stamp benefits to striking workers was justified because \xe2\x80\x9c[s]trikers and their union would be much better off if food stamps were available,\xe2\x80\x9d but the \xe2\x80\x9cstrikers\xe2\x80\x99 right of association does not require the Government to furnish funds to maximize the exercise of that right\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As far as I can tell, States that <em>do</em> wish to pay for employer speech are generally free to do so.  They might make clear, for example, through grant-related rules and regulations that a grant recipient can use the funds to pay salaries and overhead, which salaries and overhead might include expenditures related to management\xe2\x80\x99s role in labor organizing contests.  If so, why should States that do <em>not </em>wish to pay be deprived of a similar freedom?  Why should they be conscripted into paying?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I can find nothing in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that convincingly answers these questions.  The majority says that California <em>must</em> be acting as an impermissible regulator because it is not acting as a \xe2\x80\x9cmarket participant\xe2\x80\x9d (a role we all agree would permit it broad leeway to act like private firms in respect to labor matters).  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  But the regulator/market-participant distinction suggests a false dichotomy.  The converse of \xe2\x80\x9cmarket participant\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cregulator.\xe2\x80\x9d  A State may appropriate funds without either participating in or regulating the labor market.  And the NLRA pre-empts a State\xe2\x80\x99s actions, when taken as an \xe2\x80\x9cappropriator,\xe2\x80\x9d only if those actions amount to impermissible regulation.  I have explained why I believe that California\xe2\x80\x99s actions do not amount to impermissible regulation here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority also complains that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cimposes a targeted negative restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d one applicable only to labor.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  I do not find this a fatal objection, because the congressional statutes just discussed (which I believe are consistent with the NLRA) do exactly the same.  In any event, if, say, a State can tell employers not to use state funds to pay for a large category of expenses (say, overhead), why can it not tell employers the same about a smaller category of expenses (say, only those overhead expenses related to taking sides in a labor contest).  And where would the line then be drawn?  Would the statute pass master if California had said, do not use our money\nto pay for interior decorating, catered lunches, or labor relations?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority further objects to the fact that the statute does not \xe2\x80\x9capply\xe2\x80\x9d the constraint \xe2\x80\x9cuniformly,\xe2\x80\x9d because it permits use of state funds for \xe2\x80\x9c<em>select </em>employer advocacy activities that promote unions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  That last phrase presumably refers to an exception in the California statute that permits employers to spend state funds to negotiate a voluntary recognition of a union.  But this exception underscores California\xe2\x80\x99s basic purpose\xe2\x80\x94maintaining a position of spending neutrality on <em>contested</em> labor matters.  Where labor and management agree on unionization, there is no conflict.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I turn now to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s compliance provisions.  They require grant recipients to maintain \xe2\x80\x9crecords sufficient to show that no state funds were used\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibited expenditures; they deter the use of commingled funds for prohibited expenditures; and they impose serious penalties upon violators.  Cal. Govt. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2(c), 16645.7(b)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  The majority seems to rest its conclusions in part upon its belief that these requirements are too strict, that, under the guise of neutral enforcement, they discourage the use of <em>nonstate </em>money to engage in free debate on labor/management issues.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the majority that, should the compliance provisions, as a practical matter, unreasonably discourage expenditure of <em>nonstate </em>funds, the NLRA may well pre-empt California\xe2\x80\x99s statute.  But I cannot say on the basis of the record before us that the statute will have that effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language of the statute is clear.  The statute requires recipients of state money to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain records sufficient to show that no state funds were used\xe2\x80\x9d for prohibited expenditures.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa716645.2, 16645.7(c).  And the class of prohibited expenditures is quite broad: It covers \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any</em> expense\xe2\x80\x9d incurred in \xe2\x80\x9cany attempt\xe2\x80\x9d by an employer to \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence the decision of its employees,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9clegal and consulting fees and salaries of supervisors and employees\xe2\x80\x9d incurred during research for or the preparation, planning, coordination, or execution of activities to \xe2\x80\x9cassist, promote, or deter\xe2\x80\x9d union organizing.  \xc2\xa716646(a) (emphasis added).  And where an employer mingles state funds and non-state funds, (say, to pay a particular employee who spends part of her time dealing with unionization matters) the employer must determine \xe2\x80\x9con a pro\xc2\xa0rata basis,\xe2\x80\x9d the portion of the labor-related expenditure paid for by state funds, and maintain sufficient supporting documentation.  \xc2\xa716646(b).  Any violation of these provisions is then subject to strict penalties, including treble damages and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs.  \xc2\xa716645.8.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is less clear is the degree to which these provisions actually will deter a recipient of state funds from using non-state funds to engage in unionization matters.  And no lower court has ruled on this matter.  In the District Court, the Chamber of Commerce moved for summary judgment arguing that the statute, by placing restrictions on state funds, was pre-empted by <em>Machinists</em> and <em>Garmon</em> and also arguing that the compliance provisions are so burdensome that they would chill even private expenditures. California opposed the motion.  And California submitted expert evidence designed to show that its \xe2\x80\x9caccounting and recordkeeping requirements \xe2\x80\xa6 are similar to requirements imposed in other contexts,\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly less burdensome than the detailed requirements for federal grant recipients,\xe2\x80\x9d and allow \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility in establishing proper accounting procedures and controls.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 282\xe2\x80\x93283.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted the Chamber of Commerce\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment in part, finding that the operative sections of the statute were pre-empted for the reasons I have discussed in Part I, namely, that the operative provisions interfered with the NLRA\xe2\x80\x99s policy of encouraging \xe2\x80\x9cfree debate.\xe2\x80\x9d  225 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1199, 1204 (CD Cal. 2002).  But in doing so, it did not address the Chamber of Commerce\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the California statute\xe2\x80\x99s compliance provisions affected non-state-funded speech to the point that the NLRA pre-empted the statute.  Neither did the Court of Appeals address the question whether the compliance provisions themselves constitute sufficient grounds for finding the statute pre-empted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not believe that we can, and I would not, decide this question until the lower courts have had an opportunity to consider and rule upon the compliance-related questions.  Accordingly, I would vote to vacate the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand for further proceedings on this issue.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
