JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The appellee, Vallejo, presented to the board of land commissioners a claim for three square leagues of land, known by the name of Yulupa, situate in the County of Sonoma, California, having derived his title from Miguel Alvarado, the original grantee.</p>\n<p>The documentary evidence of the title is:  1st., a grant in due form, dated Monterey, 23d November, 1844, purporting to be signed by Micheltorena, Governor, and Francisco Arce, Secretary, with a memorandum by the secretary:  "Note has been made of this title in the proper book," and 2d, a certificate of approval by the departmental assembly, bearing date </p><p><a class="page-number" name="422">Page 63 U. S. 422</a></p><p> at the City of Los Angeles, 18 February, 1845, signed by Pio Pico, Governor, and Jose M. Corvarubias, Secretary.</p>\n<p>Neither the grant nor the certificate of approval has been found among the Mexican archives, nor the record of them upon any book of records. Both papers came from the hands of the claimant.  The genuineness of the title depends upon proof of the official signatures and some evidence of possession.</p>\n<p>The board rejected the claim, but on appeal to the district court and the production of further proof of possession that court affirmed it.</p>\n<p>The case falls within the views of the court in the <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/63/392/case.html">United States v.
