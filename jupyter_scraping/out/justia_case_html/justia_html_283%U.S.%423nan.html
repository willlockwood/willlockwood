The Boulder Canyon Project Act, December 21, 1928, authorizes the Secretary of the Interior at the expense of the United States, to construct at Black Canyon on the Colorado River a dam, a storage reservoir, and a hydroelectric plant; provides for their control, management, and operation by the United States, and declares that the authority is conferred "subject to the terms of the Colorado River Compact,"</p>\n<p>"for the purpose of controlling the floods, improving navigation, and regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof for reclamation of public lands and other beneficial uses exclusively within the United States, and for the generation of electrical energy as a means of making the project herein authorized a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking."</p>\n<p>The compact referred to is an agreement for the apportionment of the water of the river and its tributaries, entered into by all the states </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 283 U. S. 424</a></p><p> in which they flow except Arizona.  The compact declares that,</p>\n<p>"inasmuch as the Colorado River has ceased to be navigable for commerce and the reservation of its waters for navigation would seriously limit the development of its basin, the use of its waters for purposes of navigation shall be subservient to the uses of such waters for domestic, agricultural, and power purposes."</p>\n<p>The compact is approved by the Act.  This was a suit by Arizona, against the Secretary of the Interior and the states which made the compact, to enjoin operations under the Act as invasions of Arizona\'s interests in the river and as threatening existing and future use of the water within her limits, principally for irrigation.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>(1) The Court cannot inquire into the motives of the members of Congress in passing the Act.

Whether the particular structures proposed are reasonably necessary is not for the Court to determine.  <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p>(3) The fact that purposes other than navigation will also be served could not invalidate the exercise of the authority conferred by the Act even if those other purposes, standing alone, would not have justified an exercise of Congressional power.  <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p>(4) Although the authority conferred by the Act is therein stated to be "subject to the Colorado River Compact," which instrument would make the improvement of navigation subservient to all other purposes, yet the specific statement of primary purpose in the Act governs the general references to the compact, and the Court may not assume that Congress had no purpose to aid navigation, and that its real intention was that the stored water shall be so used as to defeat the declared primary purpose  P.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/283/423/case.html#456">283 U.

In support of the prayer for injunction, Arizona alleges that the mere existence of the Act will invade her <em>quasi</em>-sovereign rights in respect of the appropriation of waters within or on her borders; that the state has great need of further appropriations from the river for irrigation; that vested rights of appropriation under her laws can be acquired only by diverting the water and applying it to beneficial use; that, owing to topographical conditions, this can only be accomplished through large and costly projects, involving large-scale financing that will be impossible unless it clearly appear at or before the time of constructing the requisite works that vested rights to permanent use of the water will be acquired; that actual projects have been planned and approved under the state\'s laws which look to appropriation of a large part of the unappropriated water of the river, and which would irrigate an immense area in the state, including a large area of state land; that the needed appropriations will be prevented because, under the Act, it is proposed to store the entire unappropriated flow at the dam, and Arizona, and those claiming under her, will not be permitted to take water from the reservoir except upon agreeing that the use shall be subject to the compact, by the terms of which they will not be entitled to appropriate any water in excess of that to which there are now perfected rights in Arizona, and that the Act prevents Arizona, and those claiming under her, from acquiring necessary rights of way over lands of the United States for the irrigation of Arizona land, by subjecting such rights to the compact.</p>\n<p><em>Held</em> that there is no ground for an injunction, because:</p>\n<p>(1) The contention is based not upon any actual or threatened impairment of Arizona\'s rights, but upon assumed potential invasions.

JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Boulder Canyon Project Act, December 21, 1928, c. 42, 45 Stat. 1057,authorizes the Secretary of the Interior, at the expense of the United States, to construct at Black Canyon, on the Colorado River, a dam, a storage reservoir, and a hydroelectric plant; provides for their control, management, and operation by the United States, and declares that the authority is conferred "subject to the terms of the Colorado River compact,"</p>\n<p>"for the purpose of controlling the floods, improving navigation, and regulating the flow of the Colorado River, providing for storage and for the delivery of the stored waters thereof for reclamation of public lands, and other beneficial uses </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 283 U. S. 449</a></p><p> exclusively within the United States, and for the generation of electrical energy as a means of making the project herein authorized a self-supporting and financially solvent undertaking."</p>\n<p>Section 1.</p>\n<p>The Colorado River Compact is an agreement for the apportionment of the water of the river and its tributaries.  After several years of preliminary informal discussion, Colorado, Wyoming, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California -- the seven states through which the river system extends -- appointed commissioners in 1921 to formulate an agreement, and Congress, upon request, gave its assent, and authorized the appointment of a representative to act for the United States.  Act of August 19, 1921, c. 72, 42 Stat. 171.  On November 24, 1922, these commissioners and the federal representative signed an agreement to become effective when ratified by Congress and the legislatures of all of these states.  The Boulder Canyon Project Act approved this agreement subject to certain limitations and conditions, the approval to become effective upon the ratification of the compact, as so modified, by the legislatures of California and at least five of the six other states. T he legislatures of all these states, except Arizona, ratified the modified compact, and the Act was accordingly declared to be in effect.  Proclamation of June 25, 1929, 46 Stat. 20.</p>\n<p>On October 13, 1930, Arizona filed this original bill of complaint against Ray Lyman Wilbur, Secretary of the Interior, and the States of California, Nevada, Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Wyoming.  It charges that Wilbur is proceeding in violation of the laws of Arizona to invade its <em>quasi</em>-sovereign rights by building at Black Canyon on the Colorado River a dam, half of which is to be in Arizona, and a reservoir to store all the water of the river flowing above it in Arizona, for the purpose of diverting part of these waters from Arizona for consumptive use </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 283 U. S. 450</a></p><p> elsewhere, and of preventing the beneficial consumptive use in Arizona of the unappropriated water of the river now flowing in that state; that these things are being done under color of authority of the Boulder Canyon Project Act; that this Act purports to authorize the construction of the dam and reservoir, the diversion of the water from Arizona, and its perpetual use elsewhere; that the Act directs and requires Wilbur to permit no use or future appropriation of the unappropriated water of the main stream of the Colorado River, now flowing in Arizona and to be stored by the said dam and reservoir, except subject to the conditions and reservations contained in the Colorado River Compact, and that the Act thus attempts to enforce as against Arizona, and to its irreparable injury, the compact which it has refused to ratify.  The bill prays that the compact and the Act</p>\n<p>"and each and every part thereof be decreed to be unconstitutional, void, and of no effect; that the defendants and each of them be permanently enjoined and restrained from enforcing or carrying out said compact or said Act, or any of the provisions thereof, and from carrying out the three pretended contracts hereinabove referred to, or any of them, or any of their provisions [meaning certain contracts executed by Wilbur on behalf of the United States for the use of the stored water and developed power after the project shall have been completed], and from doing any other act or thing pursuant to or under color of said Boulder Canyon Project Act."</p>\n<p>Process was made returnable on January 12, 1931, and, on that day, all of the defendants moved that the bill be dismissed.  The grounds assigned in the motions are:  (1) that the bill does not join the United States, an indispensable party; (2) that the bill does not present any case or controversy of which the court can take judicial cognizance; (3) that the proposed action of the defendants will not invade any vested right of the plaintiff or of any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 283 U. S. 451</a></p><p> of its citizens; (4) that the bill does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action against any of the defendants.  The case was heard on these motions.</p>\n<p>The wrongs against which redress is sought are, first, the threatened invasion of the <em>quasi</em>-sovereignty of Arizona by Wilbur in building the dam and reservoir without first securing the approval of the state engineer as prescribed by its laws, and, second, the threatened invasion of Arizona\'s <em>quasi</em>-sovereign right to prohibit or to permit appropriation, under its own laws, of the unappropriated water of the Colorado River flowing within the state.  The latter invasion, it is alleged, will consist in the exercise, under the Act and the compact, of a claimed superior right to store, divert, and use such water.</p>\n<p><em>First.</em>  The claim that <em>quasi</em>-sovereign rights of Arizona will be invaded by the mere construction of the dam and reservoir rests upon the fact that both structures will be located partly within the state.  At Black Canyon, the site of the dam, the middle channel of the river is the boundary between Nevada and Arizona.  The latter\'s statutes prohibit the construction of any dam whatsoever until written approval of plans and specifications shall have been obtained from the state engineer, and the statutes declare in terms that this provision applies to dams to be erected by the United States.  Arizona Laws 1929, c. 102, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1-4.  <em>See also</em> Revised Code of 1928, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3280-3286.  The United States has not secured such approval, nor has any application been made by Wilbur, who is proceeding to construct said dam in complete disregard of this law of Arizona.</p>\n<p>The United States may perform its functions without conforming to the police regulations of a state.  <em>Johnson v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/254/51/case.html">254 U. S. 51</a></span>; <em>Hunt v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/278/96/case.html">278 U. S. 96</a></span>.

The opportunity and need for further appropriations are fully set forth in the bill.  Arizona is arid, and irrigation is necessary for cultivation of additional land.  The future growth and welfare of the state are largely dependent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 283 U. S. 459</a></p><p> upon such reclamation.  It is alleged that there are within Arizona 2,000,000 acres not now irrigated which are susceptible of irrigation by further appropriations from the Colorado River. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  To appropriate water means to take and divert a specified quantity thereof and put it to beneficial use in accordance with the laws of the state where such water is found, and, by so doing, to acquire under such laws a vested right to take and divert from the same source, and to use and consume the same quantity of water annually forever, subject only to the right of prior appropriations.  Under the law of Arizona, the perfected vested right to appropriate water flowing within the state cannot be acquired without the performance of physical acts through which the water is and will in fact be diverted to beneficial use.  Topographical conditions make it necessary that land in the state be irrigated in large projects.  The Colorado River flows, both on the boundary between Arizona and Nevada and in Arizona alone, through an almost continuous series of deep canyons, the walls of which rise in Arizona to a height varying from a few hundred to more than 5,000 feet.  The cost of installing the dams, reservoirs, canals, and distribution works required to effect any diversion will be very heavy, and financing on a large scale is indispensable.  Such financing will be impossible unless it clearly appears that, at or prior to the time of constructing such works, vested rights to the permanent use of the water will be acquired. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 283 U. S. 460</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The alleged interference with the right of the state to control additional appropriations is based upon the following facts.  The average annual flow of the Colorado River system, including the tributaries, is 18,000,000 acre-feet. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Only 9,000,000 acre-feet have been appropriated by Arizona and the defendant states.  Of this, 3,500,000 acre-feet have been appropriated in Arizona under its laws, and the remaining 5,500,000 acre-feet by the other states.  The 9,000,000 acre-feet unappropriated are now subject to appropriation in Arizona under its laws.  It is alleged that there are numerous sites suitable for the construction, maintenance, and operation of dams and reservoirs required for the irrigation of land in Arizona, and that actual projects have been planned for the irrigation of 1,000,000 acres, including 100,000 acres owned by the state.  For this purpose, 4,500,000 acre-feet annually will be additionally required.  Permits to appropriate this water have been granted by the state, and definite plans to carry out projects for the building of dams on that part of the river flowing in or on the borders of Arizona have been approved by the state engineer.  It is stated that, but for the passage of the Boulder Canyon Project Act, construction work would long since have commenced.</p>\n<p>It is conceded that the continued use of the 3,500,000 acre-feet of water already appropriated in Arizona is not now threatened.  And there is no allegation that, at the present time, the enjoyment of these rights is being interfered with in any way.  The claim strenuously urged is that the existence of the Act, and the threatened exercise of the authority to use the stored water pursuant to its terms, will prevent Arizona from exercising its right to control the making of further appropriations.  It is argued </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 283 U. S. 461</a></p><p> that such needed additional appropriations will be prevented because Wilbur proposes to store the entire unappropriated flow of the main stream of the Colorado River at the dam; that Arizona, and those claiming under it, will not be permitted to take any water from the reservoir except upon agreeing that the use shall be subject to the compact; that, under the terms of the compact, they will not be entitled to appropriate any water in excess of that to which there are now perfected rights in Arizona, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] and that, in order irrigate land in Arizona, it is frequently necessary to utilize rights of way over lands of the United States, and, since the Act provides that all such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 283 U. S. 462</a></p><p> rights of way or other privileges to be granted by the United States shall be upon the express condition and with the express covenant that they shall be subject to the compact, the Act in effect prevents Arizona and those claiming under it from acquiring such rights.</p>\n<p>This contention cannot prevail, because it is based not on any actual or threatened impairment of Arizona\'s rights, but upon assumed potential invasions.  The Act does not purport to affect and legal right of the state, or to limit in any way the exercise of its legal right to appropriate any of the unappropriated 9,000,000 acre-feet which may flow within or on its borders.  On the contrary, \xc2\xa7 18 specifically declares that nothing therein</p>\n<p>"shall be construed as interfering with such rights as the states now have either to the waters within their borders or to adopt such policies and enact such laws as they may deem necessary with respect to the appropriation, control, and use of waters within their borders, except as modified"</p>\n<p>by interstate agreement.  As Arizona has made no such agreement, the Act leaves its legal rights unimpaired.  There is no allegation of definite physical acts by which Wilbur is interfering, or will interfere, with the exercise by Arizona of its right to make further appropriations by means of diversions above the dam or with the enjoyment of water so appropriated. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Nor any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 283 U. S. 463</a></p><p> specific allegation of physical acts impeding the exercise of its right to make future appropriations by means of diversions below the dam, or limiting the enjoyment of rights so acquired, unless it be by preventing an adequate quantity of water from flowing in the river at any necessary point of diversion.</p>\n<p>When the bill was filed, the construction of the dam and reservoir had not been commenced.  Years must elapse before the project is completed.  If, by operations at the dam, any then perfected right of Arizona, or of those claiming under it, should hereafter be interfered with, appropriate remedies will be available.  <em>Compare Kansas v. Colorado,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/46/case.html">206 U. S. 46</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/206/46/case.html#117">206 U.

But Wilbur threatens no physical interference with these projects, and the Act interposes no legal inhibitions on their execution.

S. 458</a></span>.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The allegation is, in substance, this:  of the average annual flow of 18,000,000 acre-feet, the Act and compact permit the present final appropriation of only 15,000,000.  This quantity must satisfy all existing appropriations as well as all future appropriations.  Of these 15,000,000, one-half is apportioned to the so-called Upper Basin, which includes Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, and New Mexico.  The remaining 7,500,000 acre-feet have been allotted to the so-called Lower Basin, which includes Arizona and parts of Nevada and California.  Of the water thus allotted to the Lower Basin, 6,500,000 acre-feet have already been appropriated, and, under a contract made by Wilbur with the Metropolitan water district of Southern California, the remaining 1,000,000 are to be diverted to it.  Thus, it is argued that, consistently with the Act and compact, it will be impossible for Arizona to make any further appropriation unless it be under the following provision.  The compact provides that no part of the 3,000,000 acre-feet of the estimated annual flow not now apportioned shall be appropriated until after October 1, 1963, as such water may be required to satisfy rights of Mexico, through which country the river flows after leaving the United States.  If the satisfaction of recognized Mexican rights reduces the unappropriated water below 1,000,000 acre-feet annually, the Lower Basin states may require the Upper Basin states to deliver, from their apportionment, one-half of the amount required to meet the deficit.  It is claimed that Arizona thus may use, but not legally appropriate, any unappropriated water which is available for use by it, and that this restricted right does not justify the expenditures necessary for putting the water to beneficial use in Arizona.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>There is in the bill a further allegation that, under color of the Act, Wilbur has seized and taken possession of all that part of the Colorado River which flows in Arizona and on the boundary thereof, and of the water now flowing therein, and of all the dam sites and reservoir sites suitable for irrigation of the Arizona land and for the generation of electric power,</p>\n<p>"and now has said river, said water, and said sites in his possession, and has excluded and is now excluding the State of Arizona, its citizens, inhabitants, and property owners from said river, said water, and said sites, and from all access thereto; has prevented and is now preventing said state, its citizens, inhabitants, and property owners from appropriating any of said 8,000,000 acre-feet of unappropriated water. . . ."</p>\n<p>But, from other parts of the bill and from the argument, it is clear that there has been no physical taking of possession of anything, and that Wilbur has not trespassed on lands belonging either to Arizona or any of its citizens.  This allegation is thus merely a conclusion of law from the fact that Wilbur, in conformity with the provisions of the Act, has made plans for the construction of the dam and reservoir, promulgated regulations concerning the use of the water to be stored, and executed contracts for the use of some of it.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>It is also argued that, of the 7,500,000 acre-feet allotted by the compact to the Upper Basin states, only 2,500,000 have already been appropriated, and that thus the presently unused surplus of 5,000,000 acre-feet cannot be appropriated in Arizona.  But Arizona is not bound by the compact as it has withheld ratification.  If and when withdrawals pursuant to the compact by the Upper Basin states diminish the amount of water actually available for use in Arizona, appropriate action may then be brought.</p>\n<p>The allegation that the inclusion in the compact of the waters of the Gila river (all of which are said to have been appropriated in Arizona) operates to reduce the amount of water which may be taken by that state can likewise be disregarded.  Not being bound by the compact, Arizona has not assented to this inclusion of the Gila appropriations in the allotment to the Lower Basin, and there is no allegation that Wilbur or any of the defendant states are interfering with perfected rights to the waters of that river, which enters the Colorado 286 miles below Black Canyon.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
