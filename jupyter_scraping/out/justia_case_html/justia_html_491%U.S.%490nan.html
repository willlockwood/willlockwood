Co. v. Ry. Labor Execs.\' Ass\'n, 491 U.S.  490 (1989)</h3><p><b>Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad Co. v.</b></p><p><b>Railway Labor Executives\' Association</b></p><p><b>No. 87-1589</b></p><p><b>Argued March 29, 1989</b></p><p><b>Decided June 21, 1989</b></p><p><b>491 U.S. 490</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>Faced with heavy losses, petitioner Pittsburgh and Lake Erie Railroad Co. (P&amp;LE) agreed to sell its assets to P&amp;LE Rail Co., Inc. (Railco), a newly formed subsidiary of another railroad.  Railco intended to operate the railroad as P&amp;LE had except that it would not assume P&amp;LE\'s various collective bargaining contracts, and would need only 250 of the 750 employees then working for P&amp;LE.  P&amp;LE rejected the assertion of the unions representing its employees that the proposed sale could not be implemented until P&amp;LE complied with the Railway Labor Act (RLA) provisions prohibiting carriers from changing rates of pay, rules, or working conditions embodied in agreements, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 152 Seventh, unless they first give at least 30 days\' written notice of, and proceed to bargain over, the intended agreement change, \xc2\xa7 156.  Section 156 also requires that the working conditions in question remain in <em>status quo</em> until the controversy is resolved.  Most of the unions then filed \xc2\xa7 156 notices proposing extensive changes in existing agreements to ameliorate the proposed sale\'s adverse impact on employees.  P&amp;LE again refused to bargain, asserting that the sale was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) under the Interstate Commerce Act (ICA), which requires that noncarriers such as Railco seeking to acquire a rail line first obtain the ICC\'s approval, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10901.  Respondent Railway Labor Executives\' Association (RLEA) filed suit on behalf of the unions in the District Court, seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to P&amp;LE\'s RLA obligations and an injunction against the sale pending completion of RLA bargaining.  The unions then went on strike, and the District Court denied P&amp;LE\'s request for a restraining order on the ground that the Norris-LaGuardia Act (NLGA) prohibited it from enjoining a work stoppage growing out of a labor dispute.  Subsequently, Railco filed an application for exemption from \xc2\xa7 10901\'s requirements pursuant to the ICC\'s <em>Ex Parte No. 392</em> Class Exemption (Ex Parte 392), which provides abbreviated procedures </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 491 U. S. 491</a></p><p> for seeking approval for acquisitions by noncarriers of an operating railroad or its assets, and the ICC allowed the exemption to become effective on the date required by <em>Ex Parte 392.</em>   Although \xc2\xa7 10901 and <em>Ex Parte 392</em> allow the ICC to require the acquiring company to provide protection for railroad employees affected by a sale, none of the unions requested protective provisions.  The District Court then granted P&amp;LE\'s reapplication for an order restraining the strike, ruling that the ICC\'s approval of the sale negated any duty that P&amp;LE had to bargain over the sale\'s effects on its employees, and that the NLGA did not forbid issuance of an injunction under such circumstances.  However, the Court of Appeals summarily reversed, holding that the ICA did not require accommodation of the NLGA\'s restrictions on the District Court\'s powers, and remanding for a determination whether the sale or strike violated the RLA.  The District Court then held that, although P&amp;LE did not have a duty to bargain over its decision to sell, the RLA required it to bargain over the sale\'s effects on its employees, and that \xc2\xa7 156\'s <em>status quo</em> provision required that P&amp;LE\'s RLA bargaining obligations be satisfied before the sale could be consummated despite the ICC\'s approval of the transaction.  The court therefore granted RLEA\'s request for an injunction against the sale, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.  This Court then granted P&amp;LE\'s petitions for certiorari challenging, in No. 87-1888, the Court of Appeals\' affirmance of the injunction against the sale and seeking, in No. 87-1589, reversal of the Court of Appeals\' judgment setting aside the strike injunction.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. The RLA did not require or authorize an injunction against the sale of P&amp;LE\'s assets to Railco.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#502">491 U. S. 502</a></span>-512.</p>\n<p>(a) The RLA did not require P&amp;LE itself to give notice of its decision to sell and thereafter to bargain about the effects of the sale.  Section 156 requires those actions only when the carrier is proposing a "change in agreements."  In holding that the loss of jobs resulting from the proposed sale clearly would require such a "change," the Court of Appeals did not point out how the sale would alter any specific provision of any agreement; did not suggest that any such agreement dealt with the possibility of a sale, sought to confer any rights on employees in the event of a sale, or guaranteed that jobs would be available indefinitely; and did not explain how P&amp;LE\'s decision to remove itself from the railroad business and terminate its position as a railroad employer would violate or require changing any agreement.  Nor did the court purport to find an implied agreement that P&amp;LE would not go out of business, would not sell its assets, or would protect its employees from the adverse consequences of a sale.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#503">491 U. S. 503</a></span>-504. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 491 U. S. 492</a></p><p></p>\n<p>(b) Although the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 notices may have proposed far-reaching changes in the existing agreements, the giving of those notices did not obligate P&amp;LE to maintain the <em>status quo</em> and to postpone its sale to Railco beyond the time the sale was approved by the ICC and was scheduled to be consummated.  <em>Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line Railroad Co. v. Transportation Union,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html">396 U. S. 142</a></span> -- which held that, when a rail union files a \xc2\xa7 156 notice, the <em>status quo</em> provision forbids the railroad to make any change in preexisting "objective working conditions" even if those conditions are not contained in express or implied agreements -- does not control here, primarily because that case did not involve a carrier\'s decision to quit the railroad business, sell its assets, and cease to be a railroad employer.  <em>Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/263/case.html">380 U. S. 263</a></span>, established that the decision to close down a business entirely is so much a management prerogative that only an unmistakable expression of congressional intent will require a ruling to the contrary.  The RLA contains no expression of intent to render an employer\'s decision to go out of business and consequently to reduce to zero the number of available jobs a change in the conditions of employment forbidden by \xc2\xa7 156\'s <em>status quo</em> provision.  Where, as here, the collective bargaining agreement is silent concerning the sale of a railroad\'s assets and the railroad has proceeded in accordance with the ICA to obtain the ICC\'s approval of the sale, a union cannot delay the immediate consummation of the sale by filing a \xc2\xa7 156 notice.  This construction of the RLA satisfies the Court\'s obligation to avoid conflicts between overlapping statutory regimes, since it maintains the ICC\'s plenary authority over rail acquisitions by noncarriers.  In contrast, enjoining the sale\'s consummation based on the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 notices would likely result in the sale\'s cancellation and the frustration of Congress\' intent through ICA amendments to deregulate the rail industry and to assist small rail lines with financial problems.  Pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#504">491 U. S. 504</a></span>-511</p>\n<p>(c) However, P&amp;LE did have a limited duty to bargain in response to the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 notices.  Its decision to sell, as such, was not a bargainable subject.  Nevertheless, to the extent that it could satisfy the unions\' proposals for changes, it was required to bargain about the effects that the sale would or might have upon its employees.  That obligation ceased on the date for closing the sale after the <em>Ex Parte 392</em> exemption became effective.  P.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#512">491 U. S. 512</a></span></p>\n<p>2. The record is insufficient to allow this Court to determine whether the Court of Appeals correctly set aside the injunction against the strike.  Although the NLGA\'s general limitation on district courts\' power to issue injunctions in labor disputes must give way when necessary to enforce a duty specifically imposed by another statute, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the ICA creates no such duty.  While \xc2\xa7 10901 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="493">Page 491 U. S. 493</a></p><p> does authorize the ICC to impose labor protective provisions and gives unions the right to seek such protection and the right to judicial review if dissatisfied, no applicable ICA provision requires unions to participate in ICC proceedings or to seek protection rather than striking.  Furthermore, labor protection provisions run against the acquiring railroad rather than the seller, and nothing in the ICA relieved P&amp;LE of its duty to bargain with the unions until its transaction was completed or empowered the ICC to intrude into the relationship between P&amp;LE and the unions.  However, the NLGA\'s limitation on injunctions must also be accommodated to the specific provisions of the RLA, such that district courts have jurisdiction and power to issue injunctive orders against strikes violative of those provisions.  Since neither of the lower courts ever ruled on whether the RLA creates a duty not to strike while its dispute resolution mechanisms are underway, the matter must be resolved on remand.

P&amp;LE has experienced financial problems of increasing severity, having lost $60 million during the five years preceding the onset of these cases.  After other efforts to improve its condition failed, notably workforce reductions, concessions from its employees, and market expansion, P&amp;LE decided that in order to recoup for its owners any part of their investments it must sell its assets. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  On July 8, 1987, P&amp;LE agreed to sell its assets for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="495">Page 491 U. S. 495</a></p><p> approximately $70 million to a newly formed subsidiary, P&amp;LE Rail Co., Inc. (Railco), of Chicago West Pullman Transportation Corporation (CWP). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Railco intended to operate the railroad as P&amp;LE had except that Railco would not assume P&amp;LE\'s collective bargaining contracts with its various unions and would need only about 250 employees, rather than the 750 then working for P&amp;LE. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  When the unions representing P&amp;LE\'s employees were notified of the proposed sale, they asserted that the sale would have an effect on the working conditions of the carrier\'s employees, and therefore was subject to the requirements of the RLA, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 152 Seventh and 156, which provide:</p>\n<p>"\xc2\xa7 152 . . .

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>The unions advised that they stood ready to negotiate all aspects of the matter, including the decision to sell the railroad assets.  P&amp;LE responded that it was willing to discuss the matter, but that \xc2\xa7 156 notice and bargaining were not required, since the transaction was subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC or Commission) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 491 U. S. 497</a></p><p> under the ICA, and since the requirements of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 155 and 156 would intrude on that regime as well as upon management\'s prerogatives to conduct the affairs of the company with respect to the sales transaction.</p>\n<p>Most of the unions then responded by themselves filing \xc2\xa7 156 notices proposing changes in existing agreements to ameliorate the adverse impacts of the proposed sale upon P&amp;LE\'s employees.  The unions sought guarantees that the sale would not cause any employee to be deprived of employment or to be placed in any worse position with respect to pay or working conditions and that P&amp;LE would require that the purchaser of its rail line assume P&amp;LE\'s collective bargaining agreements. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  P&amp;LE again declined to bargain, asserting that the transaction was within the exclusive jurisdiction of the ICC.  On August 19, respondent, Railway Labor Executives\' Association (RLEA), on behalf of P&amp;LE\'s unions, filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, seeking a declaratory judgment with respect to P&amp;LE\'s obligations under the RLA </p><p><a class="page-number" name="498">Page 491 U.

Section 10901(e) specifies the procedures for this purpose, and provides that the ICC "may" require the acquiring company</p>\n<p>"to provide a fair and equitable arrangement for the protection of railroad employees who may be affected thereby no less protective of and beneficial to the interests of such employees than those established pursuant to section 11347 of this title.

A petition to revoke filed by RLEA on October 2 is still pending before the Commission.

The District Court granted the request on October 8, ruling that the authorization of the sale by the ICC negated any duty that P&amp;LE had to bargain over the effects of the sale on its employees, and that the NLGA did not forbid issuance of an injunction under such circumstances. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  On October 26, however, the Court of Appeals summarily reversed, holding that the ICA did not require accommodation of the NLGA\'s restrictions on the District Court\'s powers.  831 F.2d 1231 (CA3 1987).  A remand was ordered to determine whether the sale or strike violated the RLA.  The unions did not resume their strike when the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s injunction, but threatened to do so if P&amp;LE attempted to consummate the sale to Railco.

Addressing the unions\' request for an injunction, the District Court held that, although P&amp;LE did not have a duty to bargain over its decision to sell, P&amp;LE was required by the RLA to bargain over the effects of the sale on employees, and that the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156 required that its bargaining obligations under the RLA must be satisfied before the sale could be consummated, despite approval of the transaction by the ICC acting pursuant to the ICA.  677 F.Supp. 830 (WD Pa. 1987).

We first address whether the RLA required P&amp;LE to give notice of its decision to sell and to bargain about the effects of the sale.  We then consider whether the unions\' own notices and the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156 justified the injunction. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 491 U.

The Court of Appeals rejected this submission, focusing on the effects the sale would have on employees and concluding that the</p>\n<p>"loss of jobs by possibly two-thirds of the employees clearly would require a \'change in agreements affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.\'"</p>\n<p>845 F.2d at 428.  The court did not point out how the proposed sale would require changing any specific provision of any of P&amp;LE\'s collective bargaining agreements.  It did not suggest that any of those agreements dealt with the possibility of the sale of the company, sought to confer any rights on P&amp;LE\'s employees in the event of the sale, or guaranteed that jobs would continue to be available indefinitely. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  What P&amp;LE proposed to do would remove it from the railroad business and terminate its position as a railroad employer; and, like the Court of Appeals, RLEA does not explain how such action would violate or require changing any of the provisions of the unions\' written contracts with P&amp;LE.</p>\n<p>Of course, not all working conditions to which parties may have agreed are to be found in written contracts.  <em>Detroit &amp; Toledo Shore Line Railroad Co. v.

But the Court of Appeals did not purport to find an implied agreement that P&amp;LE would not go out of business, would not sell its assets, or, if it did, would protect its employees from the adverse consequences of such action.  Neither does RLEA.  We therefore see no basis for holding that P&amp;LE should have given a \xc2\xa7 156 notice of a proposed "change" in its express or implied agreements with the unions when it contracted to sell its assets to Railco.  Nor was it, based on its own decision to sell, obligated to bargain about the impending sale or to delay its implementation.  We find RLEA\'s arguments to the contrary quite unconvincing.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>There is more substance to the Court of Appeals\' holding, and to RLEA\'s submission, that the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 notices proposed far-reaching changes in the existing agreements over which P&amp;LE was required to bargain, and that the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156 prohibited P&amp;LE from going forward with the sale pending completion of the "purposely long and drawn-out" procedures which the Act requires to be followed in order to settle a "major" dispute.  <em>Railway Clerks v.

RLEA submits that the relationship of employer-employee and the state of being employed are among those working conditions that may not be changed until the RLA procedures are satisfied.  We are unconvinced, for several reasons, that this is the case.</p>\n<p>The facts of <em>Shore Line,</em> briefly stated, were these:  Shore Line operated 50 miles of rail line between Lang Yard in Toledo, Ohio, and Dearoad Yard near Detroit, Michigan.  For many years, all train and engine crews reported for duty and finished the day at Lang Yard.  When it was necessary to perform switching and other operations at other points, crews were transported at railroad expense to those outlying points.  The company proposed to establish outlying work assignments at Trenton, Michigan, some 35 miles north of Lang Yard.  Crews assigned there would have to report there.  The proposed change was not forbidden by, and would not have violated, the parties\' collective bargaining agreement.  The union filed a \xc2\xa7 156 notice seeking to amend the agreement to forbid the railroad from making outlying assignments.  The issue was not settled by the parties, and the union called for mediation.  While the Mediation Board proceedings were pending, the railroad posted a bulletin creating the disputed assignment at Trenton.  The union threatened a strike, the company sued to restrain the strike, and the union counterclaimed for an injunction relying on the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156.  The District Court and the Court of Appeals held for the union, and we affirmed over a dissent by Justice Harlan, joined by Chief Justice Burger.  We held that, even though Shore Line did not propose to change any of its agreements, the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156 -- "rates of pay, rules, or working conditions shall not be altered" pending exhaustion of the required procedure -- forbade any change by Shore Line in the "objective working conditions" then existing.  396 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html#153">396 U. S. 153</a></span>.  We noted that had it been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="506">Page 491 U. S. 506</a></p><p> the practice to make outlying work assignments, the company would have been within its rights to make the Trenton assignment; but the prior practice, the objective working condition, was to have crews report for work and come back to Lang Yard.  That working condition could not be changed pending resolution of the dispute without violating the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156, even though there was nothing in the agreement between the parties to prevent outlying assignments.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html#153">396 U. S. 153</a></span>-154.</p>\n<p><em>Shore Line,</em> in our view, does not control this case.  In the first place, our conclusion in that case that the <em>status quo</em> provision required adherence not only to working conditions contained in express or implied agreements between the railroad and its union but also to conditions "objectively" in existence when the union\'s notice was served, and that otherwise could be changed without violating any agreement, extended the relevant language of \xc2\xa7 156 to its outer limits, and we should proceed with care before applying that decision to the facts of this case. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Second, reporting at Lang Yard, we thought, had been the unquestioned practice for many years, and we considered it reasonable for employees to deem it sufficiently established that it would not be changed without bargaining and compliance with the <em>status quo</em> provisions of the RLA.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 491 U. S. 507</a></p><p> Third, and more fundamentally, the decision did not involve a proposal by the railroad to terminate its business.  Here, it may be said that the working condition existing prior to the \xc2\xa7 156 notice was that P&amp;LE was operating a railroad through the agency of its employees, but there was no reason to expect, simply from the railroad\'s long existence, that it would stay in business, especially in view of its losses, or that rail labor would have a substantial role in the decision to sell or in negotiating the terms of the sale.  Whatever else <em>Shore Line</em> might reach, it did not involve the decision of a carrier to quit the railroad business, sell its assets, and cease to be a railroad employer at all, a decision that we think should have been accorded more legal significance than it received in the courts below.  Our cases indicate as much.</p>\n<p>In <em>Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/263/case.html">380 U. S. 263</a></span> (1965), an employer closed its textile mill when a union won a representation election.  The National Labor Relations Board concluded that this action was an unfair labor practice under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 8(a)(1) and (3) of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA).  The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the complete or partial liquidation of an employer\'s business, even though motivated by antiunion animus, was not an unfair practice.  We affirmed in part, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] ruling that, insofar as the NLRA is concerned, an employer "has an absolute right to terminate his entire business for any reason he pleases. . . ."  380 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/263/case.html#268">380 U.

S. 509</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Although Darlington arose under the NLRA, we are convinced that we should be guided by the admonition in that case that the decision to close down a business entirely is so much a management prerogative that only an unmistakable expression of congressional intent will suffice to require the employer to postpone a sale of its assets pending the fulfillment of any duty it may have to bargain over the subject matter of union notices such as were served in this case.  Absent statutory direction to the contrary, the decision of a railroad employer to go out of business and consequently to reduce to zero the number of available jobs is not a change in the conditions of employment forbidden by the <em>status quo</em> provision of \xc2\xa7 156.  In this case, P&amp;LE concluded that it must sell its assets, and its agreement to sell to Railco, if implemented, would have removed it from the railroad business; no longer would it be a railroad employer.  No longer would it need the services of members of the rail unions.  The RLEA concedes that, had the collective bargaining agreements expressly waived bargaining concerning sale of P&amp;LE\'s assets, the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 notices to change the agreements could not trump the terms of the agreements, and could not delay the sale.  Brief for Respondent 44.  We think the same result follows where the agreement is silent on the matter and the railroad employer has proceeded in accordance with the ICA.  In these circumstances, there is little or no basis for the unions to expect that a \xc2\xa7 156 notice would be effective to delay the company\'s departure from the railroad business.  Congress clearly requires that sales transactions like P&amp;LE\'s proposal must satisfy the requirements of the ICA, but we find nothing in the RLA to prevent the immediate consummation of P&amp;LE\'s contract to sell.  When the ICC approved the sale by permitting the <em>Ex Parte 392</em> exemption to become effective, P&amp;LE was free to close the transaction, and should not have been enjoined from doing so. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="510">Page 491 U. S. 510</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This construction of the RLA also responds to our obligation to avoid conflicts between two statutory regimes, namely, the RLA and ICA, that in some respects overlap.  As the Court has said, we</p>\n<p>"are not at liberty to pick and choose among congressional enactments, and when two statutes are capable of coexistence, it is the duty of the courts, absent a clearly expressed congressional intention to the contrary, to regard each as effective."</p>\n<p><em>Morton v.

We act accordingly in this case.</p>\n<p>Congress has exercised its Commerce Clause authority to regulate rail transportation for over a century.  <em>See</em> Act to regulate commerce of 1887 (the Interstate Commerce Act), ch. 104, 24 Stat. 379.  In doing so, Congress has assigned to the ICC plenary authority over rail transactions, ranging from line extensions, consolidations, and abandonments, to acquisitions.  In particular, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10901(a) of the ICA permits noncarriers to acquire a rail line only if the ICC determines that "the present or future public convenience and necessity require or permit" the rail acquisition and operation.  The ICC may approve certification on satisfaction of various conditions.  Specifically, it has authority to impose labor protection provisions, though it is not obligated to do so.  \xc2\xa7 10901(e).  Acting pursuant to \xc2\xa7 10505, the ICC, in its <em>Ex Parte 392</em> exemption proceedings, declared all noncarrier acquisitions presumptively exempt from \xc2\xa7 10901 regulation.  Such transactions would be deemed approved seven days after a notice filed by the acquiring entities.  49 CFR \xc2\xa7 1150.32(b) (1987).  And absent a showing of exceptional circumstances, which rail labor was entitled to demonstrate, labor protection provisions would not be imposed.  The <em>Ex Parte 392</em> procedures, and the ICA, \xc2\xa7 10505 exemption authority generally, like amendments to ICA in the last two </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 491 U. S. 511</a></p><p> decades, <em>see, e.g.,</em> the Railroad Revitalization and Regulatory Reform Act of 1976, Pub.L. 94-210, 90 Stat. 31; the Staggers Rail Act of 1980, Pub.L. 96-448, 94 Stat. 1895, aimed at reversing the rail industry\'s decline through deregulatory efforts, above all by streamlining procedures to effectuate economically efficient transactions.</p>\n<p>Here P&amp;LE agreed to sell its assets to Railco.  The transaction was presented to the ICC and an <em>Ex Parte 392</em> exemption was requested.  The ICC rejected the unions\' applications to stay or reject the exemption, which became effective seven days after it was requested.  The unions then successfully sought an injunction delaying the closing of the transaction based on their \xc2\xa7 156 notices.  The Court of Appeals several times noted the tension between the two regimes, but concluded that the provisions of the RLA left no room for a construction easing those tensions.  This was the case even though the injunction that was affirmed would likely result in cancellation of P&amp;LE\'s sale and the frustration of Congress\' intent through ICA amendments to deregulate the rail and air industries generally, and more specifically to assist small rail lines with financial problems.  We disagree with that conclusion, for, as we have said, we are confident that the RLA is reasonably subject to a construction that would, at least to a degree, harmonize the two statutes. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  The injunction, which effectively prevented the sale from going forward, should not have been granted. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 491 U. S. 512</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Our holding in this case, which rests on our construction of the RLA and not on the preemptive force of the ICA, is that petitioner was not obligated to serve its own \xc2\xa7 156 notice on the unions in connection with the proposed sale.  We also conclude that the unions\' notices did not obligate P&amp;LE to maintain the <em>status quo</em> and postpone the sale beyond the time the sale was approved by the Commission and was scheduled to be consummated.  We do not hold, however, that P&amp;LE had no duty at all to bargain in response to the unions\' \xc2\xa7 156 motions.  The courts below held, and RLEA agrees, that P&amp;LE\'s decision to sell, as such, was not a bargainable subject.  The disputed issue is whether P&amp;LE was required to bargain about the effects that the sale would or might have upon its employees.  P&amp;LE, in our view, was not entirely free to disregard the unions\' demand that it bargain about such effects.  When the unions\' notices were served, however, the terms of P&amp;LE\'s agreement with Railco were more or less settled, and P&amp;LE\'s decision to sell on those terms had been made.  To the extent that the unions\' demands could be satisfied only by the assent of the buyers, they sought to change or dictate the terms of the sale, and in effect challenged the decision to sell itself.  At that time, P&amp;LE was under no obligation to bargain about the terms it had already negotiated.  To the extent that the unions\' proposals could be satisfied by P&amp;LE itself, those matters were bargainable, but only until the date for closing the sale arrived, which, of course, could not occur until the <em>Ex Parte 392</em> exemption became effective. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  We are therefore constrained to reverse the Court of Appeals in No. 87-1888. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="513">Page 491 U.

At that time, the Ex Parte 392 exemption had become effective, and the District Court held that, because the ICC had in effect authorized the sale and had ruled that delay would be prejudicial to the parties and the public interests, the NLGA prohibition against issuing injunctions in labor dispute cases must be accommodated to the ICC\'s decision that the sale of assets should go forward.  It was this decision, based on the legal significance of the ICA and its impact on the NLGA, that the Court of Appeals summarily reversed.  We agree with that decision.</p>\n<p>We have held that the NLGA \xc2\xa7 4 general limitation on district courts\' power to issue injunctions in labor disputes must be accommodated to the more specific provisions of the RLA:  "[T]he District Court has jurisdiction and power to issue necessary injunctive orders" to enforce compliance with the requirements of the RLA "notwithstanding the provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act."  <em>Trainmen v.

Thus, a union may be enjoined from striking when the dispute concerns the interpretation or application of its contract and is therefore subject to compulsory arbitration.  <em>Trainmen v.

S. 514</a></p><p> labor to seek such provisions from the ICC, and its right to judicial review if dissatisfied.  It is urged that the ICA provides a comprehensive scheme for the resolution of labor protection issues arising out of ICC-regulated transactions, and that rail labor must take advantage of those procedures, rather than strike.  We are unpersuaded that this is the case.</p>\n<p>The prohibition of the NLGA must give way when necessary to enforce a duty specifically imposed by another statute.  But no applicable provision has been called to our attention that imposes any duty on rail unions to participate in ICC proceedings and to seek ICC protections with which they must be satisfied.  Furthermore, labor protection provisions run against the acquiring railroad, rather than the seller.  Yet here it is with the seller, P&amp;LE, that the unions wanted to bargain, seeking to ease the adverse consequences of the sale.  To that end, the unions served \xc2\xa7 156 notices which, at least to some extent, obligated P&amp;LE to bargain until its transaction was closed.  We find nothing in the ICA that relieved P&amp;LE of that duty, nor anything in that Act that empowers the ICC to intrude into the relationship between the selling carrier and its railroad unions.  We are thus quite sure that the NLGA forbade an injunction against that strike unless the strike was contrary to the unions\' duties under the RLA.</p>\n<p>As to that issue, the Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p>"We intimate no view as to whether the provisions of the Railway Labor Act are applicable to this dispute so that the district court would be entitled to enjoin the strike while that Act\'s dispute resolution mechanisms are underway.  RLEA\'s complaint seeking a declaration that the Railway Labor Act is applicable to this dispute is the merits issue before the district court."</p>\n<p>831 F.2d at 1237.  On remand, the District Court held that the RLA was indeed applicable to the dispute, and on that basis issued an injunction against P&amp;LE.  It did not, however, ever address the question whether the unions\' </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 491 U.

P&amp;LE perfunctorily asserts in its briefs in this Court that the strike injunction was proper because the unions were obligated to bargain, rather than strike, after their \xc2\xa7 156 notices were served.  RLEA did not respond to this assertion.  With the case in this position, we shall not pursue the issue.  Instead, we vacate the judgment of the Court of Appeals, and leave the matter, if it is a live issue, to be dealt with on remand.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals in No. 87-1888 is reversed and the judgment in No. 87-1589 is vacated, and the cases are remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>Attempts to interest major rail lines in the property were unavailing because of the high cost of labor protection that would have been mandatory under the section of the ICA applicable to purchases by an existing carrier.  49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 11347 (1982 ed., Supp. V), which is set forth in  <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>P&amp;LE would keep certain real estate and some 6,000 rail cars.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>CWP anticipated inviting all P&amp;LE employees to submit applications, and intended to give preference to them in hiring.

No. 96-448, 94 Stat. 194-45, numerous new short lines and regional rail lines were created, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10901, through the sale of marginally profitable and unprofitable rail lines to new entities eager to provide rail service.  In considering and approving these sales, the Commission became convinced that the expense imposed on such sales by the imposition of labor protective conditions was hampering the development of short line railroads and, indeed, was forcing the selling carriers to abandon these marginal lines pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 10903 of the ICA."</p>\n<p>"In order to foster the development of short line railroads to preserve rail facilities, service and employment that would otherwise be lost through abandonments, the Commission began withholding labor protections in individual sales.  After considering over five years many such applications, the Commission determined that the formation of new rail carriers should be encouraged.  In order to aid rail formations, the Commission promulgated the procedures in Ex Parte No. 392.  In <em>Ex Parte 392,</em> the Commission exempted rail line sales to new carriers from full compliance with Commission procedures while retaining authority, under its revocation power, to review the transaction and correct any problem arising out of the transaction."</p>\n<p>Brief for Interstate Commerce Commission 3-4 (footnote and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>In the <em>Ex Parte 392</em> proceedings, the RLEA demanded that the Commission impose labor conditions in all \xc2\xa7 10901 sale transactions.  The Commission, however, ruled that labor protective provisions would be imposed in individual cases only upon a showing of exceptional circumstances.  1 I.C.C.2d 810, 815 (1985), <em>review denied sub nom., Illinois Commerce Commission v. ICC,</em> 260 U.S.App.D.C. 38, 817 F.2d 145 (1987).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The ICC modified the <em>Ex Parte 392</em> procedure in 1988 to extend the waiting period from 7 to 35 days.  <em>See</em> 53 Fed.Reg. 5981-5982 (1988).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See</em> n. 7, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The order was to remain in effect until the District Court ruled on the preliminary injunction sought by P&amp;LE.  It was this order that was reviewed by the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The strike and the decisions of the Court of Appeals effectively terminated the proposed sale to Railco.  Efforts to find another buyer were unsuccessful, but since P&amp;LE is still interested in selling its assets and the issues in these cases have a bearing on those efforts, the cases, as the Court of Appeals recognized and the parties agree, are not moot.</p>\n<p>Also, in late September, P&amp;LE and its unions had informal exchanges about the effects of the sale.  On October 14, one of the unions invoked the services of the Mediation Board.  After the April 8, 1988, Court of Appeals\' decision, 845 F.2d 420 (CA3), effects bargaining proceeded, and as these cases indicate, the parties have not resolved their differences.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Court of Appeals stated that</p>\n<p>"P&amp;LE\'s agreements with its unions, however, do not appear to contemplate this type of transaction [<em>i.e.,</em> sale of the rail lines], and thus neither expressly permit nor prohibit the sale."</p>\n<p>845 F.2d at 428, n. 9.  RLEA asserts that P&amp;LE had granted job security guarantees to some of its employees, <em>see</em> Brief for Respondent RLEA 3, but the record does not contain the collective bargaining contracts, and if there were such guarantees, there is no claim that they would survive the sale of the rail line.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 156 deals with bargaining and settlement procedures with respect to changes in <em>agreements</em> affecting rates of pay, rules, or working conditions.  There must be notice of such intended changes, as well as bargaining and mediation if requested or proffered.  And in every case involving such notice, <em>i.e.,</em> of intended changes in agreements, rates of pay, rules or working conditions shall not be changed by the carrier until the specified procedures are satisfied.  Because \xc2\xa7 156 concerns changes in <em>agreements,</em> it is surely arguable that it is open to a construction that would not require the <em>status quo</em> with respect to working conditions that have never been the subject of an agreement, expressed or implied, and that, if no notice of changes had been served by the union, could be changed by the carrier without any bargaining whatsoever.  <em>Shore Line</em> rejected that construction, but, as indicated in the text, we are not inclined to apply <em>Shore Line</em> to the decision of P&amp;LE to go out of business.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>We thought that a partial liquidation might present a different case, and remanded for further findings.  <em>See</em> 380 U.S. at 268, 276-277.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>First National Maintenance Corp. v.

S. 263</a></span> (1965), arose under the NLRA, we concluded that</p>\n<p>"the harm likely to be done to an employer\'s need to operate freely in deciding whether to shut down part of its business purely for economic reasons outweighs the incremental benefit that might be gained through the union\'s participation in making the decision."</p>\n<p>452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/666/case.html#686">452 U. S. 686</a></span>.  Further, we held that the employer\'s decision to close down a segment of its business "is not part of \xc2\xa7 8 (d)\'s <em>terms and conditions,\' . . . over which Congress has mandated bargaining."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In so holding, we did not feel constrained by the Court\'s decision in <em>Railroad Telegraphers v. Chicago &amp; N.W. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/330/case.html">362 U. S. 330</a></span> (1960).  Indeed, we rejected the argument that <em>Telegraphers</em> compelled us to find bargaining over this decision mandatory.  Although we pointed in <em>First National Maintenance</em> to the important distinctions between the RLA and the NLRA, there are other reasons why <em>Telegraphers</em> does not dictate the result in this case.  In <em>Telegraphers,</em> the Court held that the District Court was without jurisdiction to grant injunctive relief against a labor strike under the provisions of the NLGA.  A closelY divided Court reasoned that a railroad\'s proposal to abandon certain single-agent stations, and hence abolish some jobs, was a bargainable issue.  In <em>Darlington</em> and <em>First National Maintenance,</em> we concluded that the analysis in <em>Telegraphers,</em> which rested on an "expansive" reading of the RLA and the NLGA, did not govern a decision under the NLRA.  452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/666/case.html#687">452 U. S. 687</a></span>, n. 23.  In this case, we examine <em>Telegraphers</em> once again in the context of the RLA.  In <em>Telegraphers,</em> a railroad was seeking simply to eliminate or consolidate some of its little-used local stations.  The railroad here, by contrast, sought to sell all its lines and go out of business.  There is nothing in <em>Telegraphers</em> that forces us to reach the result, in this extreme case, that P&amp;LE was prohibited from terminating its operations without first bargaining with the unions.  Notwithstanding the policy considerations prompting the enlarged scope of mandatory bargaining under the RLA, in light of <em>Darlington,</em> which <em>First National Maintenance</em> reaffirmed, we are not inclined to extend <em>Telegraphers</em> to a case in which the railroad decides to retire from the railroad business.\n</em></p>\n<p>The dissent, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#518">491 U. S. 518</a></span>-520, seems to assert that <em>Shore Line</em> and <em>Telegraphers</em> dealt with a railroad\'s freedom to leave the market.  But as we point out, that is precisely what those cases did not involve.  We are plainly at odds with the dissent with respect to the significance of P&amp;LE\'s decision to leave the railroad business.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>P&amp;LE argues that the RLA injunction was an impermissible collateral attack on the ICC order approving the sale.  But the ICA, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10901, and the RLA, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 156, as we construe them, are complementary regimes.  Here, the ICC simply granted an exemption from the strictures of \xc2\xa7 10901, which permitted, but did not order, the consummation of the sale.  It made no finding that would prevent enforcement of \xc2\xa7 156.</p>\n<p>The dissent, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#515">491 U. S. 515</a></span>, asserts that we ignore the principle that P&amp;LE, a regulated utility, may not enter or leave the market without agency approval.  Of course, we do not, for we set out the law that requires ICC consent to the sale, which was obtained.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>We address the duty to bargain about the effects of the sale only in the context of the facts existing when the unions\' notices were served.

[<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  They may not raise rates or cut services, for example, without permission from a regulatory agency.  Most significantly for this case, they may neither enter nor leave the market without agency approval.  Ignoring this principle, the Court in Part II of its opinion arrives at a result that, while perhaps preferable as a matter of policy, contradicts our previous interpretations of the relevant statute.

Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 10101 <em>et seq.</em> (1982 ed. and Supp. V).  Regulation of employment relationships within the rail industry followed, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  and, in 1926, Congress enacted the Railway Labor Act (RLA), 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 151 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>The intervening six decades were marked by relatively peaceful coexistence between the two statutes.  During the course of the employment relationship, the RLA provided the means for resolving disputes.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#496">491 U.

If a railroad sought to end that relationship by sale, consolidation, or abandonment, the ICC routinely conditioned approval on the railroad\'s acceptance of either job protection or some form of severance pay for employees who would be affected by the change.  <em>See United States v.

No. 1), Class Exemption for the Acquisition and Operation of Rail Lines Under 49 U.S.C. 10901,</em> 1 I.C.C.2d 810, 815 (1985), <em>review denied sub nom. Illinois Commerce Comm\'n v.

Unlike other employment contracts, however, rail labor agreements are altered not by periodic renegotiation, but by notification, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 6 of the RLA, 45 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 156, of a desire to change terms in the agreements.  <em>See</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 66-67.  Thus, it is not surprising that the unions in this case did not seek labor protective provisions until -- just 18 months after the ICC abdicated its traditional protective role -- plans to sell the railroad surfaced. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>There is no disagreement that labor protective provisions related to the effects of an abandonment or sale may be the subject of collective bargaining.

Co. v. Transportation Union,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html">396 U. S. 142</a></span> (1969) (<em>Shore Line</em>), concerned a railroad\'s proposal to make new work assignments, a change neither authorized nor prohibited by the collective bargaining agreement.  The Court held that, once the union had served notice of its desire to bargain, the railroad was obligated to maintain the <em>status quo</em> until completion of the RLA\'s "<em>purposely long and drawn out\'" bargaining process.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html#149">396 U.

Instead, the section speaks plainly of \'rates of pay, rules, or working conditions,\' without any limitation to those obligations already embodied in collective agreements.

S. 153</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Today the Court proffers three reasons why <em>Shore Line</em> does not control this case.  First, it asserts that the <em>Shore Line</em> holding that "<em>status quo</em>" includes "conditions <em>objectively\' in existence when the union\'s notice was served" stretched the language of the statute "to its outer limits," <em>ante</em> at 506.  I am not at all sure that is true; even if it is, the holding is unambiguous, and has the force of law.  Second, the Court suggests that the fact that the work assignment changed in <em>Shore Line</em> had been in effect for many years justified an expectation "that it would not be changed without bargaining and compliance with the <em>status quo</em> provisions of the RLA."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#506">491 U. S. 506</a></span>.  This effectively restates Justice Harlan\'s argument in dissent that, while not limited to the terms of written agreements, the <em>status quo</em> obligation is limited to a change in settled practice.  <em>See Shore Line,</em> 396 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/142/case.html#159">396 U. S. 159</a></span>-160.  The Court\'s emphasis on those dissenting remarks avails it nothing, because the instant controversy also arose out of a change in established procedure.  By either a subjective or objective measure, therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that these employees\' jobs are among the "working conditions" that must be preserved throughout the bargaining process.\n</em></p>\n<p>Third, and most importantly, the Court points out that, in contrast with this case, the railroad in <em>Shore Line</em> had not proposed "to quit the railroad business, sell its assets, and cease to be a railroad employer at all," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#507">491 U. S. 507</a></span>.  The simple reply is that, in spite of claims of "<em>managerial prerogative\'" much like those advanced here, [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] the Court in <em>Telegraphers</em> </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 491 U. S. 521</a></em></p><p><em> held that the effects of a railroad\'s decision to terminate a part of its business constituted a proper subject of bargaining.  There is no relevant difference between the partial abandonment in <em>Telegraphers</em> and the transfer of ownership proposed in this case:  in both, rail service would continue as before, but many employees would lose their jobs.\n</em></p>\n<p>Management\'s motive in <em>Telegraphers,</em> to cut costs by eliminating a large number of dispensable jobs, was of course perfectly reasonable.  Thus, when the Court held that the RLA required the railroad to bargain over the effects of the change, Justice Clark wrote:</p>\n<p>"Today the Court tells the railroad that it must bargain with the union or suffer a strike.  The latter would be the death knell of the railroad.  Hence, for all practical purposes, the Court is telling the railroad that it must secure the union\'s approval before severing the hundreds of surplus employees now carried on its payroll.  Everyone knows what the answer of the union will be.  It is like the suitor who, when seeking the hand of a young lady, was told by her to \'go to father.\'  But, as the parody goes,"</p>\n<p>"she knew that he knew that her father was dead; she knew that he knew what a life he had led; and she knew that he knew what she meant when she said \'go to father.\'"</p>\n<p>362 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/362/330/case.html#343">362 U. S. 343</a></span>-344 (dissenting opinion).  Had the sale in this case proceeded, the railroad would have operated the same service with a workforce of 250, as compared to 750 employees.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/490/case.html#495">491 U. S. 495</a></span>.  The economic benefits of that reduction are as obvious as those that would have been achieved by closing obsolete stations on the railroad system in <em>Telegraphers.</em>  It is just as obvious, I believe, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 491 U. S. 522</a></p><p> the RLA again commands bargaining.  As Judge Becker noted in his opinion for the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<p>"We are fully aware of the unfortunate ramifications and irony of our decision.  A bargaining order, and a <em>status quo</em> injunction, designed to foster conciliation, promote labor peace, and ultimately keep the rails running, may ultimately have the perverse effect of destroying the only chance P&amp;LE has for survival, and perhaps even the very jobs that the unions are now trying to protect.  Although we are not happy with this result, we feel constrained to reach it, because the Supreme Court has appropriately admonished the judiciary not to apply its own brand of \'common sense\' in the face of a contrary statutory mandate."</p>\n<p>845 F.2d 420, 446 (CA3 1988) (citing <em>TVA v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html">437 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html#193">437 U. S. 193</a></span>-195 (1978)).</p>\n<p>To evade the natural result of adherence to <em>Shore Line</em> and <em>Telegraphers,</em> the Court relies on two later opinions declaring that "an employer has the absolute right to terminate his entire business for any reason he pleases," <em>Textile Workers v. Darlington Mfg. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/263/case.html">380 U.
