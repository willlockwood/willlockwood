It has an affiliation agreement with Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospital), which requires the Hospital to offer vacant staff physician posts to University faculty members.  Respondent, a physician of Middle Eastern descent who was both a University faculty member and a Hospital staff physician, claimed that Dr. Levine, one of his supervisors at the University, was biased against him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage.  He complained to Dr. Fitz, Levine\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor.  But after he arranged to continue working at the Hospital without also being on the University\xe2\x80\x99s faculty, he resigned his teaching post and sent a letter to Fitz and others, stating that he was leaving because of Levine\xe2\x80\x99s harassment.  Fitz, upset at Levine\xe2\x80\x99s public humiliation and wanting public exoneration for her, objected to the Hospital\xe2\x80\x99s job offer, which was then withdrawn.  Respondent filed suit, alleging two discrete Title VII violations.  First, he alleged that Levine\xe2\x80\x99s racially and religiously motivated harassment had resulted in his constructive discharge from the University, in violation of \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a), which prohibits an employer from discriminating against an employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, and national origin\xe2\x80\x9d (referred to here as status-based discrimination).  Second, he claimed that Fitz\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prevent the Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Levine\xe2\x80\x99s harassment, in violation of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), which prohibits employer retaliation \xe2\x80\x9cbecause [an employee] has opposed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. an unlawful employment practice .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. made a [Title VII] charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  The jury found for respondent on both claims.  The Fifth Circuit vacated as to the constructive-discharge claim, but affirmed as to the retaliation finding on the theory that retaliation claims brought under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a)\xe2\x80\x94like \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) status-based claims\xe2\x80\x94require only a showing that retaliation was a motivating factor for the adverse employment action, not its but-for cause, see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  And it found that the evidence supported a finding that Fitz was motivated, at least in part, to retaliate against respondent for his complaints about Levine.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).

See Meyer v. Holley, \n\n537 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280\n.  An employee alleging status-based discrimination under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 need not show \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation.  It suffices instead to show that the motive to discriminate was one of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives for the decision.  This principle is the result of Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228\n, and the ensuing Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), which substituted a new burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.  As relevant here, that Act added a new subsection to \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932, providing that \xe2\x80\x9can unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlso relevant here is this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167\n, which interprets the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA) phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. age,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  Gross holds two insights that inform the analysis of this case.  The first is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d as it relates to the principles of causation underlying both \xc2\xa7623(a) and \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  The second is the significance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 structural choices in both Title VII itself and the 1991 Act.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision appears in a different section from its status-based discrimination ban.  And, like \xc2\xa7623(a)(1), the ADEA provision in Gross, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse employment action against an employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d of certain criteria.  Given the lack of any meaningful textual difference between \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) and \xc2\xa7623(a)(1), the proper conclusion is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action.  Respondent and the United States maintain that \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)\xe2\x80\x99s motivating-factor test applies, but that reading is flawed.  First, it is inconsistent with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s plain language, which addresses only race, color, religion, sex, and national origin discrimination and says nothing about retaliation.  Second, their reading is inconsistent with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s design and structure.  Congress inserted the motivating-factor provision as a subsection within \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932, which deals only with status-based discrimination.  The conclusion that Congress acted deliberately in omitting retaliation claims from \xc2\xa72000\xe2\x80\x932(m) is reinforced by the fact that another part of the 1991 Act, \xc2\xa7109, expressly refers to all unlawful employment actions.  See EEOC v. Arabian American Oil Co., \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244\n.  Third, the cases they rely on, which state the general proposition that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrimination, see, e.g., CBOCS West, Inc. v. Humphries, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 442\n\xe2\x80\x93453; G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez v. Potter, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474\n, do not support the quite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d especially in a precise, complex, and exhaustive statute like Title VII.  The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, which contains seven paragraphs of detailed description of the practices constituting prohibited discrimination, as well as an express antiretaliation provision, and which was passed only a year before \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, shows that when Congress elected to address retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so clearly.

Lessening the causation standard could also contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, siphoning resources from efforts by employers, agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.

Swift &amp; Co., \n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134\n.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s final argument\xe2\x80\x94that if \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) does not control, then the Price Waterhouse standard should\xe2\x80\x94is foreclosed by the 1991 Act\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to Title VII, which displaced the Price Waterhouse framework.

The requisite relation between prohibited conduct and compensable injury is governed by the principles of causation, a subject most often arising in elaborating the law of torts.  This case requires the Court to define those rules in the context of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e et\xc2\xa0seq., which provides remedies to employees for injuries related to discriminatory conduct and associated wrongs by employers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTitle VII is central to the federal policy of prohibiting wrongful discrimination in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s workplaces and in all sectors of economic endeavor.  This opinion discusses the causation rules for two categories of wrongful employer conduct prohibited by Title VII.  The first type is called, for purposes of this opinion, status-based discrimination.  The term is used here to refer to basic workplace protection such as prohibitions against employer discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, in hiring, firing, salary structure, promotion and the like.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  The second type of conduct is employer retaliation on account of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s having opposed, complained of, or sought remedies for, unlawful workplace discrimination.  See \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn employee who alleges status-based discrimination under Title VII need not show that the causal link between injury and wrong is so close that the injury would not have occurred but for the act.  So-called but-for causation is not the test.  It suffices instead to show that the motive to discriminate was one of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s motives, even if the employer also had other, lawful motives that were causative in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  This principle is the result of an earlier case from this Court, Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228 (1989)\n, and an ensuing statutory amendment by Congress that codified in part and abrogated in part the holding in Price Waterhouse, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B).  The question the Court must answer here is whether that lessened causation standard is applicable to claims of unlawful employer retaliation under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the Court has not addressed the question of the causation showing required to establish liability for a Title VII retaliation claim, it has addressed the issue of causation in general in a case involving employer discrimination under a separate but related statute, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 (ADEA), \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623.  See Gross v. FBL Financial Services, Inc., \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167 (2009)\n.  In Gross, the Court concluded that the ADEA requires proof that the prohibited criterion was the but-for cause of the prohibited conduct.  The holding and analysis of that decision are instructive here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner, the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center (University), is an academic institution within the University of Texas system.  The University specializes in medical education for aspiring physicians, health professionals, and scientists.  Over the years, the University has affiliated itself with a number of healthcare facilities including, as relevant in this case, Parkland Memorial Hospital (Hospital).  As provided in its affiliation agreement with the University, the Hospital permits the University\xe2\x80\x99s students to gain clinical experience working in its facilities.  The agreement also requires the Hospital to offer empty staff physician posts to the University\xe2\x80\x99s faculty members, see App. 361\xe2\x80\x93362, 366, and, accordingly, most of the staff physician positions at the Hospital are filled by those faculty members.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent is a medical doctor of Middle Eastern descent who specializes in internal medicine and infectious diseases.  In 1995, he was hired to work both as a member of the University\xe2\x80\x99s faculty and a staff physician at the Hospital.  He left both positions in 1998 for additional medical education and then returned in 2001 as an assistant professor at the University and, once again, as a physician at the Hospital.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2004, Dr. Beth Levine was hired as the University\xe2\x80\x99s Chief of Infectious Disease Medicine.  In that position Levine became respondent\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate (though not direct) superior.  Respondent alleged that Levine was biased against him on account of his religion and ethnic heritage, a bias manifested by undeserved scrutiny of his billing practices and productivity, as well as comments that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Middle Easterners are lazy.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  674 F.\xc2\xa03d 448, 450 (CA5 2012).  On different occasions during his employment, respondent met with Dr. Gregory Fitz, the University\xe2\x80\x99s Chair of Internal Medicine and Levine\xe2\x80\x99s supervisor, to complain about Levine\xe2\x80\x99s alleged harassment.  Despite obtaining a promotion with Levine\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in 2006, respondent continued to believe that she was biased against him.  So he tried to arrange to continue working at the Hospital without also being on the University\xe2\x80\x99s faculty.  After preliminary negotiations with the Hospital suggested this might be possible, respondent resigned his teaching post in July 2006 and sent a letter to Dr. Fitz (among others), in which he stated that the reason for his departure was harassment by Levine.  That harassment, he asserted, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stems from .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religious, racial and cultural bias against Arabs and Muslims.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 451.  After reading that letter, Dr. Fitz expressed consternation at respondent\xe2\x80\x99s accusations, saying that Levine had been \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly humiliated by th[e] letter\xe2\x80\x9d and that it was \xe2\x80\x9cvery important that she be publicly exonerated.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 41.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, the Hospital had offered respondent a job as a staff physician, as it had indicated it would.  On learning of that offer, Dr. Fitz protested to the Hospital, asserting that the offer was inconsistent with the affiliation agreement\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that all staff physicians also be members of the University faculty.  The Hospital then withdrew its offer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter exhausting his administrative remedies, respondent filed this Title VII suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas.  He alleged two discrete violations of Title VII.  The first was a status-based discrimination claim under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  Respondent alleged that Dr. Levine\xe2\x80\x99s racially and religiously moti- vated harassment had resulted in his constructive discharge from the University.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s second claim was that Dr. Fitz\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to prevent the Hospital from hiring him were in retaliation for complaining about Dr. Levine\xe2\x80\x99s harassment, in violation of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  674 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 452.  The jury found for respondent on both claims.  It awarded him over $400,000 in backpay and more than $3 million in compensatory damages.  The District Court later reduced the compensatory damages award to $300,000.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed in part and vacated in part.  The court first concluded that respondent had submitted insufficient evidence in support of his constructive-discharge claim, so it vacated that portion of the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  The court affirmed as to the retaliation finding, however, on the theory that retaliation claims brought under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a)\xe2\x80\x94like claims of status-based discrimination under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)\xe2\x80\x94require only a showing that retaliation was a motivating factor for the adverse employment action, rather than its but-for cause.

Five of them\xe2\x80\x94race, color, religion, sex, and national origin\xe2\x80\x94are personal characteristics and are set forth in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932.  (As noted at the outset, discrimination based on these five characteristics is called status-based discrimination in this opinion.)  And then there is a point of great import for this case: The two remaining categories of wrongful employer conduct\xe2\x80\x94the employee\xe2\x80\x99s opposition to employment discrimination, and the employee\xe2\x80\x99s submission of or support for a complaint that alleges employment discrimination\xe2\x80\x94are not wrongs based on personal traits but rather types of protected employee conduct.  These latter two categories are covered by a separate, subsequent section of Title VII, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the status-based discrimination provision, it is an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto discriminate against any individual .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  In its 1989 decision in Price Waterhouse, the Court sought to explain the causation standard imposed by this language.  It addressed in particular what it means for an action to be taken \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d an individual\xe2\x80\x99s race, religion, or nationality.  Although no opinion in that case commanded a majority, six Justices did agree that a plaintiff could prevail on a claim of status-based discrimination if he or she could show that one of the prohibited traits was a \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d factor in the employer\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259 (White, J., concurring in judgment); id., at 276 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  If the plaintiff made that showing, the burden of persuasion would shift to the employer, which could escape liability if it could prove that it would have taken the same employment action in the absence of all discriminatory animus.  Id., at 258 (plurality opinion); id., at 259\xe2\x80\x93260 (opinion of White, J.); id., at 276\xe2\x80\x93277 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  In other words, the employer had to show that a discriminatory motive was not the but-for cause of the adverse employment action.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo years later, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1991 (1991 Act), \n\n105Stat.\n1071.  This statute (which had many other provisions) codified the burden-shifting and lessened-causation framework of Price Waterhouse in part but also rejected it to a substantial degree.  The legislation first added a new subsection to the end of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932, i.e., Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s principal ban on status-based discrimination.  See \xc2\xa7107(a), \n\n105Stat.\n1075.  The new provision, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), states:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tThis, of course, is a lessened causation standard.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe 1991 Act also abrogated a portion of Price Waterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s framework by removing the employer\xe2\x80\x99s ability to defeat liability once a plaintiff proved the existence of an impermissible motivating factor.  See Gross, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 178, n.\xc2\xa05.  In its place, Congress enacted \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2), which provides:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(B) On a claim in which an individual proves a violation under section 2000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) of this title and [the employer] demonstrates that [it] would have taken the same action in the absence of the impermissible motivating factor, the court\xe2\x80\x94\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(i) may grant declaratory relief, injunctive relief .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and [limited] attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. ; and\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c(ii) shall not award damages or issue an order requiring any admission, reinstatement, hiring, promotion, or payment .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo, in short, the 1991 Act substituted a new burden-shifting framework for the one endorsed by Price Waterhouse.  Under that new regime, a plaintiff could obtain declaratory relief, attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs, and some forms of injunctive relief based solely on proof that race, color, religion, sex, or nationality was a motivating factor in the employment action; but the employer\xe2\x80\x99s proof that it would still have taken the same employment action would save it from monetary damages and a reinstatement order.

This time it arose in the context of a different, yet similar statute, the ADEA, \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a).  See Gross, supra.  Much like the Title VII statute in Price Waterhouse, the relevant portion of the ADEA provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]t shall be unlawful for an employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to fail or refuse to hire or to discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s age.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 176 (quoting \xc2\xa7623(a)(1); emphasis and ellipsis in original).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConcentrating first and foremost on the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. age,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court in Gross explained that the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98because of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98by reason of\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98on account of.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 176 (citing 1 Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 194 (1966); 1 Oxford English Dictionary 746 (1933); The Random House Dictionary of the English Language 132 (1966); emphasis in original).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that an employer took adverse action \xe2\x80\x98because of\xe2\x80\x99 age [meant] that age was the \xe2\x80\x98reason\xe2\x80\x99 that the employer decided to act,\xe2\x80\x9d or, in other words, that \xe2\x80\x9cage was the \xe2\x80\x98but-for\xe2\x80\x99 cause of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s adverse decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 176.

This different reading was necessary, the Court concluded, because Congress\xe2\x80\x99 1991 amendments to Title VII, including its \xe2\x80\x9ccareful tailoring of the \xe2\x80\x98motivating factor\xe2\x80\x99 claim\xe2\x80\x9d and the substitution of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B) for Price Waterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s full affirmative defense, indicated that the motivating-factor standard was not an organic part of Title VII and thus could not be read into the ADEA.

But the particular confines of Gross do not deprive it of all persuasive force.  Indeed, that opinion holds two insights for the present case.  The first is textual and concerns the proper interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d as it relates to the principles of causation underlying both \xc2\xa7623(a) and \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  The second is the significance of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 structural choices in both Title VII itself and the law\xe2\x80\x99s 1991 amendments.  These principles do not decide the present case but do inform its analysis, for the issues possess significant parallels.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs noted, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s antiretaliation provision, which is set forth in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), appears in a different section from Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ban on status-based discrimination.  The antiretaliation provision states, in relevant part:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer to discriminate against any of his employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. because he has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by this subchapter, or because he has made a charge, testified, assisted, or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under this subchapter.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis enactment, like the statute at issue in Gross, makes it unlawful for an employer to take adverse employment action against an employee \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d of certain criteria.  Cf. \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7623(a)(1).  Given the lack of any meaningful textual difference between the text in this statute and the one in Gross, the proper conclusion here, as in Gross, is that Title VII retaliation claims require proof that the desire to retaliate was the but-for cause of the challenged employment action.  See Gross, supra, at 176.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe principal counterargument offered by respondent and the United States relies on their different understanding of the motivating-factor section, which\xe2\x80\x94on its face\xe2\x80\x94applies only to status discrimination, discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.  In substance, they contend that: (1) retaliation is defined by the statute to be an unlawful employment practice; (2) \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) allows unlawful employment practices to be proved based on a showing that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for\xe2\x80\x94and not necessarily the but-for factor in\xe2\x80\x94the challenged employment action; and (3) the Court has, as a matter of course, held that \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation for complaining about race discrimination is \xe2\x80\x98discrimination based on race.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 14; see id., at 11\xe2\x80\x9314; Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9319.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere are three main flaws in this reading of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  The first is that it is inconsistent with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.  It must be acknowledged that because Title VII defines \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d to include retaliation, the question presented by this case would be different if \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) extended its coverage to all unlawful employment practices.  As actually written, however, the text of the motivating-factor provision, while it begins by referring to \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practices,\xe2\x80\x9d then proceeds to address only five of the seven prohibited discriminatory actions\xe2\x80\x94actions based on the employee\xe2\x80\x99s status, i.e., race, color, religion, sex, and national origin.  This indicates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to confine that provision\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to only those types of employment practices.  The text of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) says nothing about retaliation claims.  Given this clear language, it would be improper to conclude that what Congress omitted from the statute is nevertheless within its scope.  Gardner v. Collins, 2 Pet. 58, 93 (1829) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the legislative intention was, can be derived only from the words they have used; and we cannot speculate beyond the reasonable import of these words\xe2\x80\x9d); see Sebelius v.

See Gross, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175, n.\xc2\xa02, 178, n.\xc2\xa05.  Just as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of words is presumed to be deliberate, so too are its structural choices.  See id., at 177, n.\xc2\xa03.  When Congress wrote the motivating-factor provision in 1991, it chose to insert it as a subsection within \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932, which contains Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ban on status-based discrimination, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) to (d), (l), and says nothing about retaliation.

See Arabian American Oil Co., supra, at 256.  Or, it could have inserted the motivating-factor provision as part of a section that applies to all such claims, such as \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935, which establishes the rules and remedies for all Title VII enforcement actions.  See FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120, \n160 (2000)\n.

In support of this proposition, both respondent and the United States rely upon decisions in which this Court has \xe2\x80\x9cread [a] broadly worded civil rights statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as including an antiretaliation remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  CBOCS West, Inc. v.

And in G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez v. Potter, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 474 (2008)\n, the Court likewise read a bar on retaliation into the broad wording of the federal-employee provisions of the ADEA.  Id., at 479, 487 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll personnel actions affecting [federal] employees .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. who are at least 40 years of age .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be made free from any discrimination based on age,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(a)); see also Jackson v.

It is true these cases do state the general proposition that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of a broadly phrased antidiscrimination statute may signal a concomitant intent to ban retaliation against individuals who oppose that discrimination, even where the statute does not refer to retaliation in so many words.  What those cases do not support, however, is the quite different rule that every reference to race, color, creed, sex, or nationality in an antidiscrimination statute is to be treated as a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  For one thing, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) is not itself a substantive bar on discrimination.  Rather, it is a rule that establishes the causation standard for proving a violation defined elsewhere in Title VII.  The cases cited by respondent and the Government do not address rules of this sort, and those precedents are of limited relevance here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe approach respondent and the Government suggest is inappropriate in the context of a statute as precise, complex, and exhaustive as Title VII.  As noted, the laws at issue in CBOCS, Jackson, and G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez were broad, general bars on discrimination.  In interpreting them the Court concluded that by using capacious language Congress expressed the intent to bar retaliation in addition to status-based discrimination.  See G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez, supra, at 486\xe2\x80\x93488.  In other words, when Congress\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of the subject of prohibited discrimination was both broad and brief, its omission of any specific discussion of retaliation was unremarkable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf Title VII had likewise been phrased in broad and general terms, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s argument might have more force.  But that is not how Title VII was written, which makes it incorrect to infer that Congress meant anything other than what the text does say on the subject of retaliation.  Unlike Title IX, \xc2\xa71981, \xc2\xa71982, and the federal-sector provisions of the ADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory scheme.  This statute enumerates specific unlawful employment practices.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1), (b), (c)(1), (d) (status-based discrimination by employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and training programs, respectively); \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(l) (status-based discrimination in employment-related testing); \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) (retaliation for opposing, or making or supporting a complaint about, unlawful employment actions); \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(b) (advertising a preference for applicants of a particular race, color, religion, sex, or national origin).  It defines key terms, see \xc2\xa72000e, and exempts certain types of employers, see \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x931.  And it creates an administrative agency with both rulemaking and enforcement authority.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935, 2000e\xe2\x80\x9312.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis fundamental difference in statutory structure renders inapposite decisions which treated retaliation as an implicit corollary of status-based discrimination.  Text may not be divorced from context.  In light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 special care in drawing so precise a statutory scheme, it would be improper to indulge respondent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Congress meant to incorporate the default rules that apply only when Congress writes a broad and undifferentiated statute.  See G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez, supra, at 486\xe2\x80\x93488 (when construing the broadly worded federal-sector provision of the ADEA, Court refused to draw inferences from Congress\xe2\x80\x99 amendments to the detailed private-sector provisions); Arabian American Oil Co., 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 256; cf.

In the ADA Congress provided not just a general prohibition on discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of [an individual\xe2\x80\x99s] disability,\xe2\x80\x9d but also seven paragraphs of detailed description of the practices that would constitute the prohibited discrimination, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7102(a), (b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(7), id., at 331\xe2\x80\x93332 (codified at \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712112).  And, most pertinent for present purposes, it included an express antiretaliation provision, see \xc2\xa7503(a), \n\n104Stat.\n370 (codified at \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712203).  That law, which Congress passed only a year before enacting \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) and which speaks in clear and direct terms to the question of retaliation, rebuts the claim that Congress must have intended to use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d as the textual equivalent of \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  To the contrary, the ADA shows that when Congress elected to address retaliation as part of a detailed statutory scheme, it did so in clear textual terms.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court confronted a similar structural dispute in Lehman v. Nakshian, \n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 156 (1981)\n.  The question there was whether the federal-employment provisions of the ADEA, \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a, provided a jury-trial right for claims against the Federal Government.  Nakshian, 453 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 157.  In concluding that it did not, the Court noted that the portion of the ADEA that prohibited age discrimination by private, state, and local employers, \xc2\xa7626, expressly provided for a jury trial, whereas the federal-sector provisions said nothing about such a right.  Id., at 162\xe2\x80\x93163, 168.  So, too, here.  Congress has in explicit terms altered the standard of causation for one class of claims but not another, despite the obvious opportunity to do so in the 1991 Act.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe proper interpretation and implementation of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) and its causation standard have central importance to the fair and responsible allocation of resources in the judicial and litigation systems.  This is of particular significance because claims of retaliation are being made with ever-increasing frequency.  The number of these claims filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) has nearly doubled in the past 15 years\xe2\x80\x94from just over 16,000 in 1997 to over 31,000 in 2012.  EEOC, Charge Statistics FY 1997 Through FY 2012, http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/statistics/enforcement/ charges.cfm (as visited June 20, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Indeed, the number of retaliation claims filed with the EEOC has now outstripped those for every type of status-based discrimination except race.  See ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition lessening the causation standard could also contribute to the filing of frivolous claims, which would siphon resources from efforts by employer, administrative agencies, and courts to combat workplace harassment.  Consider in this regard the case of an employee who knows that he or she is about to be fired for poor perform- ance, given a lower pay grade, or even just transferred to a different assignment or location.  To forestall that lawful action, he or she might be tempted to make an unfounded charge of racial, sexual, or religious discrimination; then, when the unrelated employment action comes, the employee could allege that it is retaliation.  If respondent were to prevail in his argument here, that claim could be established by a lessened causation standard, all in order to prevent the undesired change in employment circumstances.  Even if the employer could escape judgment after trial, the lessened causation standard would make it far more difficult to dismiss dubious claims at the summary judgment stage.  Cf. Vance v. Ball State Univ., post, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311.  It would be inconsistent with the structure and operation of Title VII to so raise the costs, both financial and reputational, on an employer whose actions were not in fact the result of any discriminatory or retaliatory intent.  See Brief for National School Boards Association as Amicus Curiae 11\xe2\x80\x9322.  Yet there would be a significant risk of that consequence if respondent\xe2\x80\x99s position were adopted here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe facts of this case also demonstrate the legal and factual distinctions between status-based and retaliation claims, as well as the importance of the correct standard of proof.  Respondent raised both claims in the District Court.  The alleged wrongdoer differed in each: In respondent\xe2\x80\x99s status-based discrimination claim, it was his indirect supervisor, Dr. Levine.  In his retaliation claim, it was the Chair of Internal Medicine, Dr. Fitz.  The proof required for each claim differed, too.  For the status-based claim, respondent was required to show instances of racial slurs, disparate treatment, and other indications of nationality-driven animus by Dr. Levine.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim, by contrast, relied on the theory that Dr. Fitz was committed to exonerating Dr. Levine and wished to punish respondent for besmirching her reputation.  Separately instructed on each type of claim, the jury returned a separate verdict for each, albeit with a single damages award.  And the Court of Appeals treated each claim separately, too, finding insufficient evidence on the claim of status-based discrimination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf it were proper to apply the motivating-factor standard to respondent\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation claim, the University might well be subject to liability on account of Dr. Fitz\xe2\x80\x99s alleged desire to exonerate Dr. Levine, even if it could also be shown that the terms of the affiliation agreement pre- cluded the Hospital\xe2\x80\x99s hiring of respondent and that the University would have sought to prevent respondent\xe2\x80\x99s hiring in order to honor that agreement in any event.  That result would be inconsistent with the both the text and purpose of Title VII.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, Title VII defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x9d as discrimination on the basis of any of seven prohibited criteria: race, color, religion, sex, national origin, opposition to employment discrimination, and submitting or supporting a complaint about employment discrimination.  The text of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) mentions just the first five of these factors, the status-based ones; and it omits the final two, which deal with retaliation.  When it added \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) to Title VII in 1991, Congress inserted it within the section of the statute that deals only with those same five criteria, not the section that deals with retaliation claims or one of the sections that apply to all claims of unlawful employment practices.  And while the Court has inferred a congressional intent to prohibit retaliation when confronted with broadly worded antidiscrimination statutes, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s detailed structure makes that inference inappropriate here.  Based on these textual and structural indications, the Court now concludes as follows: Title VII retaliation claims must be proved according to traditional principles of but-for causation, not the lessened causation test stated in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  This requires proof that the unlawful retaliation would not have occurred in the absence of the alleged wrongful action or actions of the employer.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent and the Government also argue that applying the motivating-factor provision\xe2\x80\x99s lessened causation standard to retaliation claims would be consistent with longstanding agency views, contained in a guidance manual published by the EEOC.  It urges that those views are entitled to deference under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co., \n\n323 U.\xc2\xa0S. 134 (1944)\n.  See National Railroad Passenger Corporation v. Morgan, \n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 101\n, n.\xc2\xa06 (2002).  The weight of deference afforded to agency interpretations under Skidmore depends upon \xe2\x80\x9cthe thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade.\xe2\x80\x9d  323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140; see Vance, post, at 9, n.\xc2\xa04.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccording to the manual in question, the causation element of a retaliation claim is satisfied if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is credible direct evidence that retaliation was a motive for the challenged action,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless of whether there is also \xe2\x80\x9c[e]vidence as to [a] legitimate motive.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II(E)(1), pp. 614:0007\xe2\x80\x93614:0008 (Mar. 2003).  After noting a division of authority as to whether motivating-factor or but-for causation should apply to retaliation claims, the manual offers two rationales in support of adopting the former standard.  The first is that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ourts have long held that the evidentiary framework for proving [status-based] discrimination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. also applies to claims of discrimination based on retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 614:0008, n. 45.  Second, the manual states that \xe2\x80\x9can interpretation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that permits proven retaliation to go unpunished undermines the purpose of the anti-retaliation provisions of maintaining unfettered access to the statutory remedial mechanism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese explanations lack the persuasive force that is a necessary precondition to deference under Skidmore.  See 323 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 140; Vance, post, at 9, n.\xc2\xa04.  As to the first rationale, while the settled judicial construction of a particular statute is of course relevant in ascertaining statutory meaning, see Lorillard v. Pons, \n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 575\n\xe2\x80\x93581 (1978), the manual\xe2\x80\x99s discussion fails to address the particular interplay among the status-based discrimination provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)), the antiretaliation provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a)), and the motivating-factor provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)).  Other federal antidiscrimination statutes do not have the structure of statutory subsections that control the outcome at issue here.  The manual\xe2\x80\x99s failure to address the specific provisions of this statutory scheme, coupled with the generic nature of its discussion of the causation standards for status-based discrimination and retaliation claims, call the manual\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions into serious question.  See Kentucky Retirement Systems v.

That assertion is incorrect.  First, this position is foreclosed by the 1991 Act\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to Title VII.  As noted above, Price Waterhouse adopted a complex burden-shifting framework.  Congress displaced this framework by enacting \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) (which adopts the motivating-factor standard for status-based discrimination claims) and \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(2)(B) (which replaces employers\xe2\x80\x99 total defense with a remedial limitation).  See Gross, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175, n.\xc2\xa02, 177, n.\xc2\xa03, 178, n.\xc2\xa05.  Given the careful balance of lessened causation and reduced remedies Congress struck in the 1991 Act, there is no reason to think that the different balance articulated by Price Waterhouse somehow survived that legislation\xe2\x80\x99s passage.  Second, even if this argument were still available, it would be inconsistent with the Gross Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading (and the plain textual meaning) of the word \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d as it appears in both \xc2\xa7623(a) and \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  See Gross, supra, at 176\xe2\x80\x93177.  For these reasons, the rule of Price Waterhouse is not controlling here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe text, structure, and history of Title VII demonstrate that a plaintiff making a retaliation claim under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) must establish that his or her protected activity was a but-for cause of the alleged adverse action by the employer.  The University claims that a fair application of this standard, which is more demanding than the motivating-factor standard adopted by the Court of Appeals, entitles it to judgment as a matter of law.  It asks the Court to so hold.  That question, however, is better suited to resolution by courts closer to the facts of this case.

This form of discrimination is commonly called \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation,\xe2\x80\x9d although Title VII itself does not use that term.  The Court has recognized that effective protection against retaliation, the office of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), is essential to securing \xe2\x80\x9ca workplace where individuals are not discriminated against because of their racial, ethnic, religious, or gender-based status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Burlington N. &amp; S.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, however, drives a wedge between the twin safeguards in so-called \xe2\x80\x9cmixed-motive\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  To establish discrimination, all agree, the complaining party need show only that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was \xe2\x80\x9ca motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d in an employer\xe2\x80\x99s adverse action; an employer\xe2\x80\x99s proof that \xe2\x80\x9cother factors also motivated the [action]\xe2\x80\x9d will not defeat the discrimination claim.  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  But a retaliation claim, the Court insists, must meet a stricter standard: The claim will fail unless the complainant shows \xe2\x80\x9cbut-for\xe2\x80\x9d causation, i.e., that the employer would not have taken the adverse employment action but for a design to retaliate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn so reining in retaliation claims, the Court misapprehends what our decisions teach: Retaliation for complaining about discrimination is tightly bonded to the core pro- hibition and cannot be disassociated from it.  Indeed, this Court has explained again and again that \xe2\x80\x9cretaliation in response to a complaint about [proscribed] discrimination is discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of the characteristic Congress sought to immunize against adverse employment action.

And jurors will puzzle over the rhyme or reason for the dual standards.  Of graver concern, the Court has seized on a provision, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), adopted by Congress as part of an endeavor to strengthen Title VII, and turned it into a measure reducing the force of the ban on retaliation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDr. Naiel Nassar is of Middle Eastern descent.

In that year, UTSW hired Dr. Beth Levine to oversee the Clinic and to supervise Keiser.  Before Levine commenced her employment at UTSW, she interviewed her potential subordinates.

In Sullivan v.

Section 2000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) provides that an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice is established\xe2\x80\x9d when the plaintiff shows that a protected characteristic was a factor driving \xe2\x80\x9cany employment practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Title VII, in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), explicitly denominates retaliation, like status-based discrimination, an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because \xe2\x80\x9cany employment prac- tice\xe2\x80\x9d necessarily encompasses practices prohibited under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), by its plain terms, covers retaliation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNotably, when it enacted \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), Congress did not tie the new provision specifically to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)\xe2\x80\x93(d), which proscribe discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d race, color, religion, gender, or national origin.

In contrast, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s substantive antidiscrimination provisions refer to the protected characteristics of the complaining party.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2), (c)(2) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9csuch individual\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d protected characteristics); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(b), (c)(1), (d) (re-ferring to \xe2\x80\x9chis race, color, religion, sex, or national origin\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress thus knew how to limit Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s coverage to victims of status-based discrimination when it was so minded.  It chose, instead, to bring within \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x93 2(m) \xe2\x80\x9cany employment practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  To cut out retaliation from \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)\xe2\x80\x99s scope, one must be blind to that choice.

Shortly after Congress amended Title VII to include the motivating-factor provision, the EEOC issued guidance advising that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough [\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)] does not specify retaliation as a basis for finding liability whenever it is a motivating factor for an action, neither does it suggest  any basis for deviating from the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s long-standing rule that it will find liability .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. whenever  retaliation plays any role in an employment decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  EEOC, Revised Enforcement Guidance on Recent Developments in Disparate Treatment Theory, p.\xc2\xa020, n.\xc2\xa014 (July 14, 1992)  (hereinafter EEOC Guidance), available at http://www.eeoc.gov/policy/docs/disparat.html (as visited June 21, 2013, and in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  As the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s initial guidance explained, \xe2\x80\x9cif retaliation were to go unremedied, it would have a chilling effect upon the willingness of individuals to speak out against employment discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn its compliance manual, the EEOC elaborated on its conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)] applies to retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  2 EEOC Compliance Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93II(E)(1), p. 614:0008, n.\xc2\xa045 (May 20, 1998) (hereinafter EEOC Compliance Manual).

If the breadth of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) can be deemed ambiguous (although I believe its meaning is plain), the provision should be construed to accord with the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s well-reasoned and longstanding guidance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court draws the opposite conclusion, ruling that retaliation falls outside the scope of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).  In so holding, the Court ascribes to Congress the unlikely purpose of separating retaliation claims from discrimination claims, thereby undermining the Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s effort to fortify the protections of Title VII.  None of the reasons the Court offers in support of its restrictive interpretation of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) survives inspection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court first asserts that reading \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) to encompass claims for retaliation \xe2\x80\x9cis inconsistent with the provision\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 12.  The Court acknowledges, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe text of the motivating-factor provision .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. begins by referring to unlawful employment practices,\xe2\x80\x9d a term that undeniably includes retaliation.  Ibid. (internal quotation marks omitted).  Nevermind that, the Court continues, for \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) goes on to reference as \xe2\x80\x9cmotivating factor[s]\xe2\x80\x9d only \xe2\x80\x9crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court thus sees retaliation as a protected activity entirely discrete from status-based discrimination.

See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Until today, the Court has been clear eyed on just what retaliation is: a manifestation of status-based discrimination.  As Jackson explained in the context of sex discrimination, \xe2\x80\x9cretalia- tion is discrimination \xe2\x80\x98on the basis of sex\xe2\x80\x99 because it is an intentional response to the nature of the complaint: an allegation of sex discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 174.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court does not take issue with Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s insight.  Instead, it distinguishes Jackson and like cases on the ground that they concerned laws in which \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 treatment of the subject of prohibited discrimination was both broad and brief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  Title VII, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cis a detailed statutory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cenumerates specific unlawful employment practices,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdefines key terms,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cexempts certain types of employers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 16.  Accordingly, the Court says, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be improper to indulge [the] suggestion that Congress meant to incorporate [in Title VII] the default rules that apply only when Congress writes a broad and undifferentiated statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is strange logic indeed to conclude that when Congress homed in on retaliation and codified the proscription, as it did in Title VII, Congress meant protection against that unlawful employment practice to have less force than the protection available when the statute does not mention retaliation.  It is hardly surprising, then, that our jurisprudence does not support the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.  In G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez, the Court construed the federal-sector provision of the ADEA, which proscribes \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination based on age,\xe2\x80\x9d \n\n29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7633a(a), to bar retaliation.  The Court did so mindful that another part of the Act, the provision applicable to private-sector employees, explicitly proscribes retaliation and, moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cset[s] out a specific list of forbidden employer practices.\xe2\x80\x9d  G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez, 553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 486\xe2\x80\x93487 (citing 29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a) and (d)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cthe la[w] at issue in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. G\xc3\xb3mez-P\xc3\xa9rez [was a] broad, general ba[r] on discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  But, as our opinion in that case observes, some of the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s provisions are brief, broad, and general, while others are extensive, specific, and detailed.  553 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 487.  So too of Title VII.  See ibid.  (\xe2\x80\x9cThe ADEA federal-sector provision was patterned di- rectly after Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s federal-sector discrimination ban .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

It makes little sense to apply a different mode of analysis to Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) and the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7633a(a), both brief statements on discrimination in the context of larger statutory schemes.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on \xc2\xa7109(b) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, \n\n105Stat.\n1077,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), \n\n104Stat.\n327, is similarly unavailing.

The same is true of the ADA, the Court says, as \xe2\x80\x9cCongress provided not just a general prohibition on discrimination \xe2\x80\x98because of [an individual\xe2\x80\x99s] disability,\xe2\x80\x99 but also seven paragraphs of detailed description of the practices that would constitute the prohibited discrimination .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Yes, Congress has sometimes addressed retaliation explicitly in antidiscrimination statutes.  When it does so, there is no occasion for interpretation.  But when Congress simply targets discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d protected characteristics, or, as in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), refers to employment practices motivated by race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, how should courts comprehend those phrases?  They should read them informed by this Court\xe2\x80\x99s consistent holdings that such phrases draw in retaliation, for, in truth, retaliation is a \xe2\x80\x9cform of intentional [status-based] discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Jackson, 544 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 173, described supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  That is why the Court can point to no prior instance in which an antidiscrimination law was found not to cover retaliation.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s volte-face is particularly imprudent in the context of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), a provision added as part of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 effort to toughen protections against workplace discrimination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also disassociates retaliation from status-based discrimination by stressing that the bar on the latter appears in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932, while the proscription of retaliation appears in a separate provision, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933.  Section 2000e\xe2\x80\x932, the Court asserts, \xe2\x80\x9ccontains Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ban on status-based discrimination . . . and says nothing about retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 13.   Retaliation, the Court therefore concludes, should not be read into \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m).

Section 2000e\xe2\x80\x932 does not deal exclusively with discrimination based on protected characteristics.  The provisions stated after \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)\xe2\x80\x93(d) deal with a variety of matters, some of them unquestionably covering retaliation.  For example, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(n), enacted in tandem with and located immediately after \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), limits opportunities to collaterally attack employment practices installed to im- plement a consent judgment.  Section 2000e\xe2\x80\x932(n) applies beyond the substantive antidiscrimination provisions in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932; indeed, it applies beyond Title VII to encom- pass claims \xe2\x80\x9cunder the Constitution or [other] Federal civil rights laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(n)(1)(A).  Thus, if an employee sues for retaliatory discharge in violation of \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), and a consent judgment orders reinstatement, any person adversely affected by that judgment (e.g., an employee who loses seniority as a result) would generally be barred from attacking the judgment if she was given actual no- tice of the proposed order and a reasonable opportunity to present objections.  That Congress placed the consent-judgment provision in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 and not in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933 is of no moment.  As the text of the provision plainly conveys, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(n) would reach consent judgments settling complaints about retaliation, just as it would cover consent judgments settling complaints about status-based discrimination.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 2000e\xe2\x80\x932(g) is similarly illustrative.  Under that provision, \xe2\x80\x9cit shall not be an unlawful employment practice for an employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to discharge [an] individual\xe2\x80\x9d if she fails to fulfill any requirement imposed in the interest of national security.  Because \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) renders retal- iation an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful employment practice,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(g)\xe2\x80\x99s exemption would no doubt apply to a Title VII retaliatory discharge claim.  Given these provisions, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 placement of the motivating-factor provision within \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 cannot bear the weight the Court places on it.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court gives no deference to the EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding position that \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) applies to retaliation because, the Court charges, the agency did not \xe2\x80\x9caddress the particular interplay among the status-based antidiscrimination provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)), the antiretaliation provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a)), and the motivating-factor provision (\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 21.

Scott Paper Co., 109 F.\xc2\xa03d 913 (CA3 1997).  In that decision, the Third Circuit acknowledged it was \xe2\x80\x9cgiven pause by the fact that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. courts have generally borrowed from discrimination law in determining the burdens and order of proof in retaliation cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 934.  One could therefore say, the Third Circuit continued, that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress knew of the practice of borrowing in retaliation cases, and presumed that courts would continue this practice after the 1991 Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile Woodson rejected that argument, the EEOC found it sound.  See EEOC Compliance Manual, at 614:0008, n.\xc2\xa045 (\xe2\x80\x9cCourts have long held that the evidentiary framework for proving employment discrimination based on race, sex, or other protected class status also applies to claims of discrimination based on retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also EEOC Guidance, at 20, n.\xc2\xa014 (while \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) does not explicitly refer to retaliation, nothing in the provision calls for deviation from the longstanding practice of finding liability when a plaintiff demonstrates that retaliatory intent motivated an adverse employment decision).  By adverting to Woodson, the EEOC made clear that it considered the very argument the Court relies on today.  Putting down the agency\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal as \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 22, is thus conspicuously unfair comment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s second reason for refusing to accord de- ference to the EEOC fares no better.  The EEOC\xe2\x80\x99s conclu- sion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lessened causation standard is necessary in order to prevent \xe2\x80\x98proven retaliation\xe2\x80\x99 from \xe2\x80\x98go[ing] unpunished,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court reasons, \xe2\x80\x9cis circular\xe2\x80\x9d because it \xe2\x80\x9cassumes the answer to the central question at issue here, which is what causal relationship must be shown in order to prove retaliation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That reasoning will not wash.  Under the motivating-factor test set out in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m), a plaintiff prevails if she shows that proscribed conduct \xe2\x80\x9cwas a motivating factor\xe2\x80\x9d for the adverse employment action she encountered, \xe2\x80\x9ceven though other factors also moti- vated the [action].\xe2\x80\x9d  She will succeed, although the relief to which she is entitled may be restricted.  See supra, at 9.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, proof that retaliation was a factor motivating an adverse employment action is insufficient to establish liability under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s but-for causation standard does not mean that the plaintiff has failed to prove she was subjected to unlawful retaliation.  It does mean, however, that proof of a retaliatory motive alone yields no victory for the plaintiff.  Put otherwise, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view \xe2\x80\x9cpermits proven retaliation to go unpunished,\xe2\x80\x9d just as the EEOC recognized.

FBL Financial Services, Inc., \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167 (2009)\n, to answer the question presented: Whether a plaintiff must demonstrate but-for causation to establish liability under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court held in Gross that, in contrast to Title VII, \xc2\xa7623(a) of the ADEA does not authorize any age discrimination claim asserting mixed motives.  Explaining that uniform interpretation of the two statutes is sometimes unwarranted, the Court noted in Gross that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. age\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7623(a) has not been read \xe2\x80\x9cto bar discrimination against people of all ages, even though the Court had previously interpreted \xe2\x80\x98because of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. race [or] sex\xe2\x80\x99 in Title VII to bar discrimination against people of all races and both sexes.\xe2\x80\x9d  557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 175, n. 2.  Yet Gross, which took pains to distinguish ADEA claims from Title VII claims, is invoked by the Court today as pathmarking.  See ante, at 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe holding and analysis of [Gross] are instructive here.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe word \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation provision, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a), the Court tells us, should be interpreted not to accord with the interpretation of that same word in the companion status-based discrimination provision of Ti- tle VII, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a).  Instead, statutory lines should be crossed: The meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation provision should be read to mean just what the Court held \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d means for ADEA-liability purposes.  But see Gross, 557 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 174 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen conducting statutory interpretation, we \xe2\x80\x98must be careful not to apply rules applicable under one statute to a different statute without careful and critical examination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d(quoting Holowecki, 552 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 393)).  In other words, the employer prevailed in Gross because, according to the Court, the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s antidiscrimination prescription is not like Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s.  But the employer prevails again in Nassar\xe2\x80\x99s case, for there is no \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful textual difference,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 11, between the ADEA\xe2\x80\x99s use of \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d and the use of the same word in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation provision.

See Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., \n\n551 U. S. 224, \n232 (2007)\n.  Following that principle, Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s retaliation provision, like its status-based discrimination provision, would permit mixed-motive claims, and the same causation standard would apply to both provisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to construe \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x933(a) to require but-for causation in line with Gross is even more confounding in light of Price Waterhouse.  Recall that Price Waterhouse interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a) to permit mixed-motive claims.  See supra, at 8.  The Court today rejects the proposition that, if \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) does not cover retaliation, such claims are governed by Price Water- house\xe2\x80\x99s burden-shifting framework, i.e., if the plaintiff shows that discrimination was a motivating factor in an adverse employment action, the defendant may escape liability only by showing it would have taken the same action had there been no illegitimate motive.  It is wrong to revert to Price Waterhouse, the Court says, because the 1991 Civil Rights Act\xe2\x80\x99s amendments to Title VII abrogated that decision.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis conclusion defies logic.  Before the 1991 amendments, several courts had applied Price Waterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s burden-shifting framework to retaliation claims.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  In the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, Congress designed \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m)\xe2\x80\x99s motivating-factor standard not only to exclude retaliation claims, but also to override, sub silentio, Circuit precedent apply- ing the Price Waterhouse framework to such claims.  And with what did the 1991 Congress replace the Price Waterhouse burden-shifting framework?  With a but-for causation requirement Gross applied to the ADEA 17 years after the 1991 amendments to Title VII.  Shut from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s sight is a legislative record replete with statements evincing Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to strengthen antidiscrimination laws and thereby hold employers accountable for prohibited discrimination.  See Civil Rights Act of 1991, \xc2\xa72, \n\n105Stat.\n1071; House Report Part II, at 18.  It is an odd mode of statutory interpretation that divines Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim in 1991 by looking to a decision of this Court, Gross, made under a different statute in 2008, while ignoring the overarching purpose of the Congress that enacted the 1991 Civil Rights Act, see supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court shows little regard for trial judges who must instruct juries in Title VII cases in which plaintiffs allege both status-based discrimination and retaliation.  Nor is the Court concerned about the capacity of jurors to follow instructions conforming to today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Causation is a complicated concept to convey to juries in the best of circumstances.  Asking jurors to determine liability based on different standards in a single case is virtually certain to sow confusion.

When more than one factor contributes to a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury, but-for causation is problematic.

When Title VII was enacted, Congress considered and rejected an amendment that would have placed the word \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d before \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of [the complainant\xe2\x80\x99s] race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 110 Cong. Rec. 2728, 13837\xe2\x80\x9313838 (1964).  Senator Case, a prime sponsor of Title VII, commented that a \xe2\x80\x9csole cause\xe2\x80\x9d standard would render the Act \xe2\x80\x9ctotally nugatory.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 13837.  Life does not shape up that way, the Senator suggested, commenting \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f anyone ever had an action that was motivated by a single cause, he is a different kind of animal from any I know of.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court holds, at odds with a solid line of decisions recognizing that retaliation is inextricably bound up with status-based discrimination, that \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) excludes retaliation claims.  It then reaches outside of Title VII to arrive at an interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cbecause\xe2\x80\x9d that lacks sensitivity to the realities of life at work.  In this endeavor, the Court is guided neither by precedent, nor by the aims of legislators who formulated and amended Title VII.  In- deed, the Court appears driven by a zeal to reduce the number of retaliation claims filed against employers.   See ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Congress had no such goal in mind when it added \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) to Title VII.  See House Report Part II, at 2.

See ante, at 16 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnlike Title IX, \xc2\xa71981, \xc2\xa71982, and the federal-sector provisions of the ADEA, Title VII is a detailed statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d).  That comparison is inapt.  Like Title VII, the ADEA is a \xe2\x80\x9cdetailed statutory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Compare ibid. (citing Title VII provisions that proscribe status-based discrimination by employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, and training programs; bar retaliation; prohibit advertising a preference for certain protected characteristics; define terms; exempt certain employers; and create an agency with rulemaking and enforcement authority), with 29 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7623(a)\xe2\x80\x93(e) (proscribing age discrimination by employers, employment agencies, and labor unions; barring retaliation; prohibiting advertising a preference for employees of a particular age), \xc2\xa7628 (granting rulemaking authority to the EEOC), and \xc2\xa7630 (defining terms).  Thus, \xc2\xa7633a is just like \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) in the relevant respect: both are single provisions comprised within a detailed scheme.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Now codified at \n\xe2\x80\x931(b), \xc2\xa7109(b) provides:\n\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall not be unlawful under \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932 or 2000e\xe2\x80\x933 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for an employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to take any action otherwise prohibited by such section, with respect to an employee in a workplace in a foreign country if compliance with such section would cause such employer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to violate the law of the foreign country in which such workplace is located.\xe2\x80\x9d  The provision was framed to accord with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in EEOC v.

Nakshian, \n,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 17, assumes its own conclusion.  As the Court explains, in Nakshian, the plaintiff argued that \xc2\xa7633a of the ADEA afforded the right to trial by jury.  453 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 157.  An amendment to the private-sector provision, codified at \n, granted that right to plaintiffs suing private employers, as well as state and local governmental entities.  But no one argued in Nakshian that the private-sector amendment applied to the federal-sector provision.  Hence, Nakshian\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the ADEA does not permit a federal-sector plaintiff to try her case before a jury is relevant only if the Court is correct that \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(m) does not cover retaliation claims.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0See Vislisel v.
