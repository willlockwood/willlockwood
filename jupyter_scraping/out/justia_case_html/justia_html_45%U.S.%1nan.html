An exception was taken to this opinion of the court, and the present writ of error brought by the marshal upon this judgment against him.</p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>As a general principle it is undoubtedly true that the marshal is responsible for the acts of his deputy in the execution of process, and if the deputy had taken the funds mentioned in the testimony without any orders from the plaintiffs or their attorney and returned the execution satisfied, the plaintiffs would not have been bound to accept these funds in discharge of their judgment, and might have insisted on the full amount from the marshal in gold and silver.</p>\n<p>But it is clear that the plaintiffs had a right to accept in payment of their execution whatever they thought proper.  The deputy marshal was bound to obey their directions upon that subject, and neither the deputy nor the marshal can be held responsible to the plaintiffs for any loss they may sustain by reason of an act done in pursuance of their own instructions.</p>\n<p>But the plaintiffs seem to suppose that the authority given to the deputy was not pursued, and that the payment of the money to them without delay was a condition annexed to the authority, which had been disregarded by the deputy.  But however this may be, as between him and the plaintiffs, the act or omission of the deputy in that respect cannot make the marshal himself liable.  Gwinn knew nothing of the directions given by the plaintiffs\' attorney.  So far as Ferguson was acting as deputy marshal, he had no right to receive, in payment of the debt, anything but gold and silver.  He had no authority from the marshal to take anything else.  But when the plaintiffs interfered, and directed him to receive the funds above mentioned, he was, in receiving such funds, not acting under the authority of the marshal as his deputy, but as agent of the plaintiffs.  And if, in executing the power they gave him, he disobeyed their instructions, they must look to him, and not to the marshal, who knew nothing of these instructions, had no concern with them, and who cannot, therefore, upon principles of law or equity, be held responsible for the manner in which they were executed.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the circuit court must, therefore be reversed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
