JACKSON<br/>\n562 U. S. ____ (2011)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">T. FELKNER <em>v.</em> STEVEN FRANK JACKSON</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 10\xe2\x80\x93797.\xe2\x80\x83Decided March 21, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A California jury convicted respondent Steven Frank Jackson of numerous sexual offenses stemming from his attack on a 72-year-old woman who lived in his apartment complex.  Jackson raised a <em>Batson </em>claim, asserting that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges to exclude black prospective jurors on the basis of their race.  See <em>Batson</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/79/index.html">476 U. S. 79</a> (1986).  Two of three black jurors had been struck; the third served on the jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49\xe2\x80\x9350.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did not object when the prosecutor struck the first of the black jurors, Juror S.  Counsel later explained that he did not make a \xe2\x80\x9cmotion at that time\xe2\x80\x9d because he thought the excusal of Juror S \xe2\x80\x9cwas a close call.\xe2\x80\x9d  After the prosecutor sought to dismiss the second juror, Juror J, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel made the <em>Batson</em> motion challenging both strikes.  Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 7, pp. 76\xe2\x80\x9377 (hereinafter Document 7).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor offered a race-neutral explanation for striking each juror: Juror S had stated that from the ages of 16 to 30 years old, he was frequently stopped by California police officers because\xe2\x80\x94in his view\xe2\x80\x94of his race and age.  As the prosecutor put it, \xe2\x80\x9cWhether or not he still harbors any animosity is not something I wanted to roll the dice with.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 78; Record in No. 2:07-cv-00555-RJB (ED Cal.), Doc. 29, Lodged Doc. No. 10, pp. 57\xe2\x80\x9358, 98\xe2\x80\x93100 (hereinafter Document 10).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor stated that he struck Juror J because she had a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in social work, and had interned at the county jail, \xe2\x80\x9cprobably in the psych unit as a sociologist of some sort.\xe2\x80\x9d  The prosecutor explained that he dismissed her \xe2\x80\x9cbased on her educational background,\xe2\x80\x9d stating that he does not \xe2\x80\x9clike to keep social workers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Document 7, at 78\xe2\x80\x9379; Document 10, at 188\xe2\x80\x93189; App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel expressly disagreed only with the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for the strike of Juror J, see App. to Pet. for Cert. 22\xe2\x80\x9323, 47, arguing that removing her on the basis of her educational background was \xe2\x80\x9citself invidious discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  The prosecutor responded that he was not aware that social workers were a \xe2\x80\x9cprotected class.\xe2\x80\x9d  As for Juror S, Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel explained that he \xe2\x80\x9clet [Juror S] slide\xe2\x80\x9d because he anticipated the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s response and, in any event, he \xe2\x80\x9conly need[ed] one to establish the grounds for\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>Batson</em> motion.  After listening to each side\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, the trial court denied Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  Document 7, at 78\xe2\x80\x9380.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jackson renewed his <em>Batson</em> claim on direct appeal, arguing that a comparative juror analysis revealed that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s explanations were pretextual.  With respect to Juror S, Jackson argued that a non-black juror\xe2\x80\x94Juror 8\xe2\x80\x94also had negative experiences with law enforcement but remained on the jury.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  Juror 8 stated during jury selection that he had been stopped while driving in Illinois several years earlier as part of what he believed to be a \xe2\x80\x9cscam\xe2\x80\x9d by Illinois police targeting drivers with California license plates.  Juror 8 also complained that he had been disappointed by the failure of law enforcement officers to investigate the burglary of his car.  Document 10, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327, 56\xe2\x80\x9357, 95\xe2\x80\x9397.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to Juror J, Jackson claimed that the prosecutor asked follow-up questions of several white jurors when he was concerned about their educational backgrounds, but struck Juror J without asking her any questions about her degree in social work.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 49.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California Court of Appeal upheld the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the <em>Batson </em>motion and affirmed Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  The appellate court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling on this issue is reviewed for substantial evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 43 (internal quotation marks omitted), which the California courts have characterized as equivalent to the \xe2\x80\x9cclear error\xe2\x80\x9d standard employed by federal courts, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>People </em>v. <em>Alvarez</em>, 14 Cal. 4th 155, 196, 926 P.\xc2\xa02d 365, 389 (1996).  With respect to whether the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s stated reasons were pretextual, the court explained that it \xe2\x80\x9cgive[s] great deference to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to distinguish bona fide reasons from sham excuses.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 43.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After comparing Juror S to Juror 8, the court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cJuror 8\xe2\x80\x99s negative experience out of state and the car burglary is not comparable to [Juror S\xe2\x80\x99s] 14 years of perceived harassment by law enforcement based in part on race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48.  As for Juror J, the court recognized that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal was based on her social services background\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ca proper race-neutral reason\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and that this explained his different treatment of jurors with \xe2\x80\x9cbackgrounds in law, bio-chemistry or environmental engineering.\xe2\x80\x9d  The court also noted that the \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutor focused on [Juror J\xe2\x80\x99s] internship experience\xe2\x80\x9d at the county jail.  <em>Id.</em>, at 49.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the California Supreme Court denied Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review, Jackson sought federal habeas relief.  The Federal District Court properly recognized that review of Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s claim was governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  That law provides, in pertinent part, that federal habeas relief may not be granted unless the state court adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  After considering the state Court of Appeal decision and reviewing the record evidence, the District Court held that the California Court of Appeal\xe2\x80\x99s findings were not unreasonable.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 24.  The District Court therefore denied Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed in a three-paragraph unpublished memorandum opinion.  389 Fed. Appx. 640 (2010).  In so doing, the court did not discuss any specific facts or mention the reasoning of the other three courts that had rejected Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Instead, after setting forth the basic background legal principles in the first two paragraphs, the Court of Appeals offered a one-sentence conclusory explanation for its decision:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s proffered race-neutral bases for peremptorily striking the two African-American jurors were not sufficient to counter the evidence of purposeful discrimination in light of the fact that two out of three prospective African-American jurors were stricken, and the record reflected different treatment of comparably situated jurors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 641.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThat decision is as inexplicable as it is unexplained.  It is reversed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Batson </em>issue before us turns largely on an \xe2\x80\x9cevaluation of credibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  476 U. S., at 98, n. 21.  The trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cgreat deference,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and \xe2\x80\x9cmust be sustained unless it is clearly erroneous,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Snyder</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/472/index.html">552 U. S. 472</a>, 477 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is the standard on direct review.  On federal habeas review, AEDPA \xe2\x80\x9cimposes a highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Renico</em> v. <em>Lett</em>, 559 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 5) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Here the trial court credited the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s race-neutral explanations, and the California Court of Appeal carefully reviewed the record at some length in upholding the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s findings.  The state appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was plainly not unreasonable.  There was simply no basis for the Ninth Circuit to reach the opposite conclusion, particularly in such a dismissive manner.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> are granted.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
