By its terms, \xc2\xa7212(c) applied only in exclusion proceedings, but the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) extended it decades ago to deportation proceedings as well.  Although Congress substituted a narrower discretionary remedy for \xc2\xa7212(c) in 1996, see \xc2\xa71229b, \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s broader relief remains available to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s repeal, INS v.

Unless that ground is one of the two falling outside \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s scope, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief.

If the deportation ground consists of a set of crimes \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially equivalent\xe2\x80\x9d to the set making up an exclusion ground, the alien can seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief.  But if the deportation ground covers different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is ineligible for relief, even if the alien\xe2\x80\x99s particular offense falls within an exclusion ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Judulang, who has lived continuously in the United States as a lawful permanent resident since 1974, pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter in 1988.

The Immigration Judge ordered Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s deportation, and the BIA affirmed, finding Judulang ineligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d deportation ground is not comparable to any exclusion ground.

Thus, in reviewing the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s action, this Court must assess, among other matters, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the decision was based on a consideration of the relevant factors and whether there has been a clear error of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d Motor Vehicle Mfrs.

By hinging a deportable alien\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories\xe2\x80\x94a matter irrelevant to the alien\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to reside in this country\xe2\x80\x94the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.

In other words, the BIA must use an approach that is tied to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system.  The comparable-grounds rule has no connection to these factors.  Instead, it makes \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility turn on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions.  Whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to stay in this country.  Here, Judulang was found ineligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d deportation ground includes a few offenses\xe2\x80\x94simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use of a vehicle\xe2\x80\x94not found in the similar moral turpitude exclusion ground.  But the inclusion of simple assaults and minor burglaries in the deportation ground is irrelevant to the merits of Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach has other odd features.  In applying the comparable-grounds rule, the BIA has denied relief to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely within a much broader exclusion ground.  Yet providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group.  In addition, the outcome of the comparable-grounds analysis may itself rest on an arbitrary decision.  An alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction could fall within a number of deportation grounds, only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground.  In such cases, an alien\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for relief would hinge on an individual official\xe2\x80\x99s decision as to which deportation ground to charge.  An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation, while an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn short, the comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien should be deported. Instead, it turns deportation decisions into a \xe2\x80\x9csport of chance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rosenberg v. Fleuti, \n\n374 U.\xc2\xa0S. 449\n.

First, \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text does not support the rule.  That section cannot provide a textual anchor for any method of providing discretionary relief in deportation cases because it addresses only exclusion.  Second, the history of the comparable-grounds rule does not work in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  The BIA repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying \xc2\xa7212(c) to deportable aliens, settling on the current rule only in 2005.  Third, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money falls short.  Cost may be an important factor for agencies to consider in many contexts, but cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary agency policy.  In any event, it is unclear that the comparable-grounds rule saves money when compared with alternative approaches.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9321.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-G">\n\t\t\t\t249 Fed.

Before 1996, these two kinds of action occurred in different procedural settings, with an alien seeking entry (whether for the first time or upon return from a trip abroad) placed in an \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d and an alien already here channeled to a \xe2\x80\x9cdeportation proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Landon v. Plasencia, \n\n459 U.\xc2\xa0S. 21\n\xe2\x80\x9326 (1982) (comparing the two).  Since that time, the Government has used a unified procedure, known as a \xe2\x80\x9cremoval proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d for exclusions and deportations alike.  See 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71229, 1229a.  But the statutory bases for excluding and deporting aliens have always varied.  Now, as before, the immigration laws provide two separate lists of substantive grounds, principally involving criminal offenses, for these two actions.  One list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien excludable (or in the term the statute now uses, \xe2\x80\x9cinadmissible\xe2\x80\x9d), see \xc2\xa71182(a) (2006 ed., Supp. IV), while another\xe2\x80\x94sometimes overlapping and sometimes divergent\xe2\x80\x94list specifies what kinds of crime render an alien deportable from the country, see \xc2\xa71227(a).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn additional, historic difference between exclusion and deportation cases involved the ability of the Attorney General to grant an alien discretionary relief.  Until repealed in 1996, \xc2\xa7212(c) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, \n\n66Stat.\n187, \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.), authorized the Attorney General to admit certain excludable aliens.  See also \xc2\xa7136(p) (1926 ed.) (predecessor provision to \xc2\xa7212(c)).  The Attorney General could order this relief when the alien had lawfully resided in the United States for at least seven years before temporarily leaving the country, unless the alien was excludable on one of two specified grounds.  See \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But by its terms, \xc2\xa7212(c) did not apply when an alien was being deported.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis discrepancy threatened to produce an odd result in a case called Matter of L-, 1 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 1 (1940), leading to the first-ever grant of discretionary relief in a deportation case.  L- was a permanent resident of the United States who had been convicted of larceny.  Although L-\xe2\x80\x99s crime made him inadmissible, he traveled abroad and then returned to the United States without any immigration official\xe2\x80\x99s preventing his entry.  A few months later, the Government caught up with L- and initiated a deportation action based on his larceny conviction.  Had the Government apprehended L- at the border a short while earlier, he would have been placed in an exclusion proceeding where he could have applied for discretionary relief.  But because L- was instead in a deportation proceeding, no such relief was available.  Responding to this apparent anomaly, Attorney General Robert Jackson (on referral of the case from the BIA) determined that L- could receive a waiver: L-, Jackson said, \xe2\x80\x9cshould be permitted to make the same appeal to discretion that he could have made if denied admission\xe2\x80\x9d when returning from his recent trip.  Id., at 6.  In accord with this decision, the BIA adopted a policy of allowing aliens in deportation proceedings to apply for discretionary relief under \xc2\xa7212(c) whenever they had left and reentered the country after be- coming deportable.  See Matter of S-, 6 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 392, 394\xe2\x80\x93396 (1954).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut this approach created another peculiar asymmetry: Deportable aliens who had traveled abroad and returned could receive \xc2\xa7212(c) relief, while those who had never left could not.  In Francis v. INS, 532 F.\xc2\xa02d 268 (1976), the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit concluded that this disparity violated equal protection.  Id., at 273 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n alien whose ties with this country are so strong that he has never departed after his initial entry should receive at least as much consideration as an individual who may leave and return from time to time\xe2\x80\x9d).  The BIA acquiesced in the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision, see Matter of Silva, 16 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 26 (1976), thus applying \xc2\xa7212(c) in deportation proceedings regardless of an alien\xe2\x80\x99s travel history.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll this might have become academic when Congress repealed \xc2\xa7212(c) in 1996 and substituted a new discretionary remedy, known as \xe2\x80\x9ccancellation of removal,\xe2\x80\x9d which is available in a narrow range of circumstances to excludable and deportable aliens alike.  See \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b.  But in INS v. St. Cyr, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 289, \n326 (2001)\n, this Court concluded that the broader relief afforded by \xc2\xa7212(c) must remain available, on the same terms as before, to an alien whose removal is based on a guilty plea entered before \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s repeal.  We reasoned that aliens had agreed to those pleas with the possibility of discretionary relief in mind and that eliminating this prospect would ill comport with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98familiar considerations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 323 (quoting Landgraf v. USI Film Products, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244, \n270 (1994)\n).  Accordingly, \xc2\xa7212(c) has had an afterlife for resident aliens with old criminal convictions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen the BIA is deciding whether to exclude such an alien, applying \xc2\xa7212(c) is an easy matter.  The Board first checks the statutory ground that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has identified as the basis for exclusion; the Board may note, for example, that DHS has charged the alien with previously committing a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude,\xe2\x80\x9d see \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).  Unless the charged ground is one of the pair falling outside \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s scope, see n.\xc2\xa01, supra, the alien is eligible for discretionary relief.  The Board then determines whether to grant that relief based on such factors as \xe2\x80\x9cthe seriousness of the offense, evidence of either rehabilitation or recidivism, the duration of the alien\xe2\x80\x99s residence, the impact of deportation on the family, the number of citizens in the family, and the character of any service in the Armed Forces.\xe2\x80\x9d  St. Cyr, 533 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 296, n.\xc2\xa05.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, when the BIA is deciding whether to deport an alien, applying \xc2\xa7212(c) becomes a tricky business.  Recall that \xc2\xa7212(c) applies on its face only to exclusion decisions.  So the question arises: How is the BIA to determine when an alien should receive \xc2\xa7212(c) relief in the deportation context?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne approach that the BIA formerly used considered how the alien would fare in an exclusion proceeding.  To perform this analysis, the Board would first determine whether the criminal conviction making the alien deportable fell within a statutory ground for exclusion.  Almost all convictions did so, largely because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d ground encompasses so many offenses.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Assuming that threshold inquiry were met, the Board would mimic its approach in exclusion cases\xe2\x80\x94first making sure the statutory ground at issue was not excepted from \xc2\xa7212(c) and then conducting the multi-factor analysis.  See Matter of Tanori, 15 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 566, 567\xe2\x80\x93568 (1976); In\xc2\xa0re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892 (BIA, Dec. 1, 2003).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA second approach is the one challenged here; definitively adopted in 2005 (after decades of occasional use), it often is called the \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable-grounds\xe2\x80\x9d rule.  See, e.g., De la Rosa v. U. S. Attorney General, 579 F.\xc2\xa03d 1327, 1332 (CA11 2009).  That approach evaluates whether the ground for deportation charged in a case has a close analogue in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s list of exclusion grounds.  See In\xc2\xa0re Blake, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 722, 728 (2005); In\xc2\xa0re Brieva-Perez, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N.

Blake, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 728.  But if the deportation ground charged covers significantly different or more or fewer offenses than any exclusion ground, the alien is not eligible for a waiver.  Such a divergence makes \xc2\xa7212(c) inapplicable even if the particular offense committed by the alien falls within an exclusion ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTwo contrasting examples from the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s cases may help to illustrate this approach.  Take first an alien convicted of conspiring to distribute cocaine, whom DHS seeks to deport on the ground that he has commit- ted an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9cillicit trafficking in a controlled substance.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  Under the comparable-grounds rule, the immigration judge would look to see if that deportation ground covers substantially the same offenses as an exclusion ground.  And according to the BIA in Matter of Meza, 20 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 257 (1991), the judge would find an adequate match\xe2\x80\x94the exclusion ground applicable to aliens who have committed offenses \xe2\x80\x9crelating to a controlled substance,\xe2\x80\x9d 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II) and (a)(2)(C).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNow consider an alien convicted of first-degree sexual abuse of a child, whom DHS wishes to deport on the ground that he has committed an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(A), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  May this alien seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief\xc2\xa0?  According to the BIA, he may not do so\xe2\x80\x94not because his crime is too serious (that is irrelevant to the analysis), but instead because no statutory ground of exclusion covers substantially the same offenses.  To be sure, the alien\xe2\x80\x99s own offense is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude,\xe2\x80\x9d \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I), and so fits within an exclusion ground.  Indeed, that will be true of most or all offenses included in this deportation category.  See supra, at 5.  But on the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s view, the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d exclusion ground \xe2\x80\x9caddresses a distinctly different and much broader category of offenses than the aggravated felony sexual abuse of a minor charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Blake, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 728.  And the much greater sweep of the exclusion ground prevents the alien from seeking discretionary relief from deportation.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThose mathematically inclined might think of the comparable-grounds approach as employing Venn dia- grams.

But courts retain a role, and an important one, in ensuring that agencies have engaged in reasoned decisionmaking.

By hinging a deportable alien\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for discretionary relief on the chance correspondence between statutory categories\xe2\x80\x94a matter irrelevant to the alien\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to reside in this country\xe2\x80\x94the BIA has failed to exercise its discretion in a reasoned manner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe parties here spend much time disputing whether the BIA must make discretionary relief available to deportable and excludable aliens on identical terms.  As this case illustrates, the comparable-grounds approach does not do so.  If Judulang were seeking entry to this country, he would be eligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief; voluntary manslaughter is \xe2\x80\x9ca crime involving moral turpitude,\xe2\x80\x9d and so his conviction falls within an exclusion ground.  But Judulang cannot apply for relief from deportation because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d ground charged in his case does not match any exclusion ground (including the one for \xe2\x80\x9cturpitudinous\xe2\x80\x9d crimes).  See infra, at 13.  Judulang argues that this disparity is impermissible because any disparity between excludable and deportable aliens is impermissible: If an alien may seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief in an exclusion case, he also must be able to seek such relief in a deportation case.  See Brief for Petitioner 47\xe2\x80\x9351.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But the Government notes that the immigration laws have always drawn distinctions between exclusion and deportation.  See Brief for Respondent 51.  And the Government presses a policy reason for making \xc2\xa7212(c) relief more readily available in exclusion cases.  Doing so, it argues, will provide an incentive for some resident aliens (i.e., those eligible for a waiver from exclusion, but not deportation) to report themselves to immigration officials, by applying for advance permission to exit and reenter the country.  In contrast, applying \xc2\xa7212(c) uniformly might lead all aliens to \xe2\x80\x9ctry to evade immigration officials for as long as possible,\xe2\x80\x9d because they could in any event \xe2\x80\x9cseek [discretionary] relief if caught.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 52.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the end, we think this dispute beside the point, and we do not resolve it.  The BIA may well have legitimate reasons for limiting \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s scope in deportation cases.  But still, it must do so in some rational way.  If the BIA proposed to narrow the class of deportable aliens eligible to seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief by flipping a coin\xe2\x80\x94heads an alien may apply for relief, tails he may not\xe2\x80\x94we would reverse the policy in an instant.  That is because agency action must be based on non-arbitrary, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98relevant factors,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d State Farm, 463 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 43 (quoting Bowman Transp., 419 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 285), which here means that the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s approach must be tied, even if loosely, to the purposes of the immigration laws or the appropriate operation of the immigration system.  A method for disfavoring deportable aliens that bears no relation to these matters\xe2\x80\x94that neither focuses on nor relates to an alien\xe2\x80\x99s fitness to remain in the country\xe2\x80\x94is arbitrary and capricious.  And that is true regardless whether the BIA might have acted to limit the class of deportable aliens eligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief on other, more rational bases.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe problem with the comparable-grounds policy is that it does not impose such a reasonable limitation.  Rather than considering factors that might be thought germane to the deportation decision, that policy hinges \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility on an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions.  Recall that the BIA asks whether the set of offenses in a particular deportation ground lines up with the set in an exclusion ground.  But so what if it does?  Does an alien charged with a particular deportation ground become more worthy of relief because that ground happens to match up with another?  Or less worthy of relief because the ground does not?  The comparison in no way changes the alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior offense or his other attributes and circumstances.  So it is difficult to see why that comparison should matter.  Each of these statutory grounds contains a slew of offenses.  Whether each contains the same slew has nothing to do with whether a deportable alien whose prior conviction falls within both grounds merits the ability to seek a waiver.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis case well illustrates the point.  In commencing Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s deportation proceeding, the Government charged him with an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d involving a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d based on his prior manslaughter conviction.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 11a\xe2\x80\x9312a.  That made him ineligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief because the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d deportation ground does not sufficiently overlap with the most similar exclusion ground, for \xe2\x80\x9ccrime[s] involving moral turpitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  The problem, according to the BIA, is that the \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d ground includes a few offenses\xe2\x80\x94simple assault, minor burglary, and unauthorized use of a vehicle\xe2\x80\x94that the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d ground does not.  See Brieva-Perez, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 772\xe2\x80\x93773; Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329, 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  But this statutory difference in no way relates to Judulang\xe2\x80\x94or to most other aliens charged with committing a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perhaps aliens like Judulang should be eligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief, or perhaps they should not.  But that determination is not sensibly made by establishing that simple assaults and minor burglaries fall outside a ground for exclusion.  That fact is as extraneous to the merits of the case as a coin flip would be.  It makes Judulang no less deserving of the opportunity to seek discretionary relief\xe2\x80\x94just as its converse (the inclusion of simple assaults and burglaries in the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d exclusion ground) would make him no more so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOr consider a different headscratching oddity of the comparable-grounds approach\xe2\x80\x94that it may deny \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility to aliens whose deportation ground fits entirely inside an exclusion ground.  The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s Blake decision, noted earlier, provides an example.  See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The deportation ground charged was \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d involving \xe2\x80\x9csexual abuse of a minor\xe2\x80\x9d; the closest exclusion ground was, once again, a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime [of] moral turpitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 727.  Here, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s problem was not that the deportation ground covered too many offenses; all or virtually all the crimes within that ground also are crimes of moral turpitude.  Rather, the BIA objected that the deportation ground covered too few crimes\xe2\x80\x94or put oppositely, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe moral turpitude ground of exclusion addresses a .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. much broader category of offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 728.  But providing relief in exclusion cases to a broad class of aliens hardly justifies denying relief in deportation cases to a subset of that group.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  (The better argument would surely be the reverse\xe2\x80\x94that giving relief in the one context supports doing so in the other.)  Again, we do not say today that the BIA must give all deportable aliens meeting \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements the chance to apply for a waiver.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  The point is instead that the BIA cannot make that opportunity turn on the meaningless matching of statutory grounds.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd underneath this layer of arbitrariness lies yet another, because the outcome of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s comparable-grounds analysis itself may rest on the happenstance of an immigration official\xe2\x80\x99s charging decision.  This problem arises because an alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction may fall within a number of deportation grounds, only one of which corresponds to an exclusion ground.  Consider, for example, an alien who entered the country in 1984 and commit- ted voluntary manslaughter in 1988.  That person could be charged (as Judulang was) with an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated fel- ony\xe2\x80\x9d involving a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d see 8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(F), 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii).  If so, the alien could not seek a waiver because of the absence of a comparable exclusion ground.  But the alien also could be charged with \xe2\x80\x9ca crime involving moral turpitude committed within five years .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. after the date of admission,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(A)(i)(I).  And if that were the deportation charge, the alien could apply for relief, because the ground corresponds to the \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude\xe2\x80\x9d ground used in exclusion cases.  See In\xc2\xa0re Salmon, 16 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 734 (1978).  So everything hangs on the charge.  And the Government has provided no reason to think that immigration officials must adhere to any set scheme in deciding what charges to bring, or that those officials are exercising their charging discretion with \xc2\xa7212(c) in mind.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 34\xe2\x80\x9336.  So at base everything hangs on the fortuity of an individual official\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  An alien appearing before one official may suffer deportation; an identically situated alien appearing before another may gain the right to stay in this country.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a foundational deportation case, this Court recognized the high stakes for an alien who has long resided in this country, and reversed an agency decision that would \xe2\x80\x9cmake his right to remain here dependent on circumstan- ces so fortuitous and capricious.\xe2\x80\x9d  Delgadillo v. Carmichael, \n\n332 U.\xc2\xa0S. 388, \n391 (1947)\n.  We think the policy before us similarly flawed.  The comparable-grounds approach does not rest on any factors relevant to whether an alien (or any group of aliens) should be deported.  It instead distinguishes among aliens\xe2\x80\x94decides who should be eligible for discretionary relief and who should not\xe2\x80\x94solely by comparing the metes and bounds of diverse statutory categories into which an alien falls.  The resulting Venn diagrams have no connection to the goals of the deportation process or the rational operation of the immigration laws.  Judge Learned Hand wrote in another early immigration case that deportation decisions cannot be made a \xe2\x80\x9csport of chance.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Di Pasquale v.

That is what the comparable-grounds rule brings about, and that is what the APA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9carbitrary and capricious\xe2\x80\x9d standard is designed to thwart.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government makes three arguments in defense of the comparable-grounds rule\xe2\x80\x94the first based on statutory text, the next on history, the last on cost.

Dec. 262, 287 (1990)).  In the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xc2\xa7212(c) is \xe2\x80\x9cphrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d; that phrasing, says the Government, counsels a comparative analysis of grounds when applying \xc2\xa7212(c) in the deportation context.  Brief for Respondent 21; see Tr. of Oral Arg. 34 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he reason [the comparable-grounds approach] makes sense is because the statute only provides for relief from grounds of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe first difficulty with this argument is that it is based on an inaccurate description of the statute.  Section 212(c) instructs that certain resident aliens \xe2\x80\x9cmay be admitted in the discretion of the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x9d notwithstanding any of \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of subsection (a) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. (other than paragraphs (3) and (9)(C)).\xe2\x80\x9d  \n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(c) (1994 ed.).  Subsection (a) contains the full list of exclusion grounds; paragraphs (3) and (9)(C) (which deal with national security and international child abduction) are two among these.  What \xc2\xa7212(c) actually says, then, is that the Attorney General may admit any excludable alien, except if the alien is charged with two specified grounds.  And that means that once the Attorney General determines that the alien is not being excluded for those two reasons, the ground of exclusion no longer matters.  At that point, the alien is eligible for relief, and the thing the Attorney General waives is not a particular exclusion ground, but the simple denial of entry.  So the premise of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument is wrong.  And if the premise, so too the conclusion\xe2\x80\x94that is, because \xc2\xa7212(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text is not \xe2\x80\x9cphrased in terms of waiving statutorily specified grounds of exclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 21, it cannot counsel a search for corresponding grounds of deportation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore fundamentally, the comparable-grounds approach would not follow from \xc2\xa7212(c) even were the Government right about the section\xe2\x80\x99s phrasing.  That is because \xc2\xa7212(c) simply has nothing to do with deportation: The provision was not meant to interact with the statutory grounds for deportation, any more than those grounds were designed to interact with the provision.  Rather, \xc2\xa7212(c) refers solely to exclusion decisions; its extension to deportation cases arose from the agency\xe2\x80\x99s extra-textual view that some similar relief should be available in that context to avoid unreasonable distinctions.  Cf., e.g., Matter of L-, 1 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 5; see also supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F11" name="T11">\n\t\t\t\t\t11\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Accordingly, the text of \xc2\xa7212(c), whether or not phrased in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cwaiving grounds of exclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d cannot support the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s use of the comparable-grounds rule\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, any other method for extending discretionary relief to deportation cases.  We well understand the difficulties of operating in such a text-free zone; indeed, we appreciate the Government\xe2\x80\x99s yearning for a textual anchor.  But \xc2\xa7212(c), no matter how many times read or parsed, does not provide one.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn disputing Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s contentions, the Government also emphasizes the comparable-grounds rule\xe2\x80\x99s vintage.  See Brief for Respondent 22\xe2\x80\x9323, 30\xe2\x80\x9343.  As an initial matter, we think this a slender reed to support a significant government policy.  Arbitrary agency action becomes no less so by simple dint of repetition.  (To use a prior analogy, flipping coins to determine \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility would remain as arbitrary on the thousandth try as on the first.)  And longstanding capriciousness receives no special exemption from the APA.  In any event, we cannot detect the consistency that the BIA claims has marked its approach to this issue.  To the contrary, the BIA has repeatedly vacillated in its method for applying \xc2\xa7212(c) to deportable aliens.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPrior to 1984, the BIA endorsed a variety of approaches.  In Matter of T-, 5 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 389, 390 (1953), for example, the BIA held that an alien was not eligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief because her \xe2\x80\x9cground of deportation\xe2\x80\x9d did not appear in the exclusion statute.  That decision anticipated the comparable-grounds approach that the BIA today uses.  But in Tanori, the BIA pronounced that a deportable alien could apply for a waiver because \xe2\x80\x9cthe same facts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in that case, a marijuana conviction\xe2\x80\x94would have allowed him to seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief in an exclusion proceeding.  15 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 568.  That approach is more nearly similar to the one Judulang urges here.  And then, in Matter of Granados, 16 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 726, 728 (1979), the BIA tried to have it both ways:  It denied \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility both because the deportation ground charged did not correspond to, and because the alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction did not fall within, a waivable ground of exclusion.  In short, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s cases were all over the map.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government insists that the BIA imposed order in Matter of Wadud, 19 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 182, 185\xe2\x80\x93186 (1984), when it held that a deportable alien could not seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief unless the deportation ground charged had an \xe2\x80\x9canalogous ground of inadmissibility.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Brief for Respondent 40\xe2\x80\x9341.  But the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s settlement, if any, was fleeting.  Just seven years later, the BIA adopted a new policy entirely, extending \xc2\xa7212(c) eligibility to \xe2\x80\x9caliens deportable under any ground of deportability except those where there is a comparable ground of exclusion which has been specifically excepted from section 212(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  Hernandez-Casillas, 20 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 266.  That new rule turned the comparable-grounds approach inside-out, allowing aliens to seek \xc2\xa7212(c) relief in deportation cases except when the ground charged corresponded to an exclusion ground that could not be waived.  To be sure, the Attorney General (on referral of the case from the BIA), disavowed this position in favor of the more standard version of the comparable-grounds rule.  Id., at 287.  But even while doing so, the Attorney General stated that \xe2\x80\x9can alien subject to deportation must have the same opportunity to seek discretionary relief as an alien . . . subject to exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That assertion is exactly the one Judulang makes in this case; it is consonant not with the comparable-grounds rule the BIA here defends, but instead with an inquiry into whether an alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction falls within an exclusion ground.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tGiven these mixed signals, it is perhaps not surprising that the BIA continued to alternate between approaches in the years that followed.  Immediately after the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Hernandez-Casillas, the BIA endorsed the comparable-grounds approach on several occasions.  See Meza, 20 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec., at 259; Matter of Montenegro, 20 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 603, 604\xe2\x80\x93605 (1992); Matter of Gabryelsky, 20 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 750, 753\xe2\x80\x93754 (1993); In\xc2\xa0re Esposito, 21 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 1, 6\xe2\x80\x937 (1995); In\xc2\xa0re Jimenez-Santillano, 21 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 567, 571\xe2\x80\x93572 (1996).  But just a few years later, the BIA issued a series of unpublished opinions that asked only whether a deportable alien\xe2\x80\x99s prior conviction fell within an exclusion ground.  See, e.g., In\xc2\xa0re Manzueta, No. A93 022 672, 2003 WL 23269892 (Dec. 1, 2003).  Not until the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in Blake and Brieva-Perez did the pendulum stop swinging.  That history hardly supports the Government\xe2\x80\x99s view of a consistent agency practice.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F12" name="T12">\n\t\t\t\t\t12\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government finally argues that the comparable-grounds rule saves time and money.  The Government claims that comparing deportation grounds to exclusion grounds can be accomplished in just a few \xe2\x80\x9cprecedential decision[s],\xe2\x80\x9d which then can govern broad swaths of cases.  See Brief for Respondent 46.  By contrast, the Government argues, Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s approach would force it to determine whether each and every crime of conviction falls within an exclusion ground.  Further, the Government contends that Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s approach would grant eligibility to a greater number of deportable aliens, which in turn would force the Government to make additional individualized assessments of whether to actually grant relief.  Id., at 47.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOnce again, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale comes up short.  Cost is an important factor for agencies to consider in many contexts.  But cheapness alone cannot save an arbitrary agency policy.  (If it could, flipping coins would be a valid way to determine an alien\xe2\x80\x99s eligibility for a waiver.)  And in any event, we suspect the Government exaggerates the cost savings associated with the comparable-grounds rule.  Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s proposed approach asks immigration officials only to do what they have done for years in exclusion cases; that means, for one thing, that officials can make use of substantial existing precedent governing whether a crime falls within a ground of exclusion.  And Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s proposal may not be the only alternative to the comparable-grounds rule.  See supra, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  In rejecting that rule, we do not preclude the BIA from trying to devise another, equally economical policy respecting eligibility for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief, so long as it comports with everything held in both this decision and St. Cyr.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe must reverse an agency policy when we cannot discern a reason for it.  That is the trouble in this case.  The BIA\xe2\x80\x99s comparable-grounds rule is unmoored from the purposes and concerns of the immigration laws.  It allows an irrelevant comparison between statutory provisions to govern a matter of the utmost importance\xe2\x80\x94whether lawful resident aliens with longstanding ties to this country may stay here.  And contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s protestations, it is not supported by text or practice or cost considerations.

Presumably, Congress thought those crimes particularly incompatible with an alien\xe2\x80\x99s continued residence in this country.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">12</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Because we find the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s prior practice so unsettled, we likewise reject Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Blake and Brieva-Perez were impermissibly retroactive.  To succeed on that theory, Judulang would have to show, at a minimum, that in entering his guilty plea, he had reasonably relied on a legal rule from which Blake and Brieva-Perez departed.  See Landgraf v. USI Film Products, \n (stating that retroactivity analysis focuses on \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderations of fair notice, reasonable reliance, and settled expectations\xe2\x80\x9d).  The instability of the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s prior practice prevents Judulang from making this showing:The BIA sometimes recognized aliens in Judulang\xe2\x80\x99s position as eligible for \xc2\xa7212(c) relief, but sometimes did not.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
