JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the case, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In  an indictment upon a statute, it is not sufficient to set forth the offense in the words of the statute unless those words of themselves fully, directly, and expressly, without any uncertainty or ambiguity, set forth all the elements necessary to constitute the offense intended to be punished, and the fact that the statute in question, read in the light of the common law and of other statutes on the like matter, enables the court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 105 U. S. 613</a></p><p> to infer the intent of the legislature, does not dispense with the necessity of alleging in the indictment all the facts necessary to bring the case within that intent.  <em>United States v. Cruikshank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/92/542/case.html">92 U. S. 542</a></span>; <em>United States v. Simmons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/360/case.html">96 U. S. 360</a></span>; <em>Commonwealth v. Clifford,</em> 8 Cush. (Mass.) 215; <em>Commonwealth v. Bean,</em> 11 <em>id.</em> 414; <em>Commonwealth v. Bean,</em> 14 Gray (Mass.) 52; <em>Commonwealth v. Filburn,</em> 119 Mass. 297.</p>\n<p>The language of the statute on which this indictment is founded includes the case of every person who, with intent to defraud, utters any forged obligation of the United States.  But the offense at which it is aimed is similar to the common law offense of uttering a forged or counterfeit bill.  In this case as in that, knowledge that the instrument is forged and counterfeited is essential to make out the crime, and an uttering, with intent to defraud of an instrument in fact counterfeit but supposed by the defendant to be genuine, though within the words of the statute, would not be within its meaning and object.</p>\n<p>This indictment, by omitting the allegation contained in the indictment in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/78/432/case.html">United States v. Howell,</a></span></em> 11 Wall. 432, and in all approved precedents, that the defendant knew the instrument which he uttered to be false, forged, and counterfeit, fails to charge him with any crime.  The omission is of matter of substance, and not a "defect or imperfection in matter of form only" within the meaning of sec. 1025 of the Revised Statutes.  By the settled rules of criminal pleading and the authorities above cited, therefore, the question of the sufficiency of the indictment must be</p>\n<p><em>Answered in the negative.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
