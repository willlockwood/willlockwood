S. 404</a></p><p></p>\n<p>THE CHIEF JUSTICE delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Several grounds are assigned for dismissing this writ.  It will be necessary to notice but three of them.</p>\n<p>The first of these is that the writ of error is prosecuted by O\'Dowd without summons and severance of his co-defendants.  Formerly this was held to be necessary when one of several defendants desired to prosecute his writ of error alone.  But in the case of <em>Masterson v. Herndon,</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] we held that such a writ of error would be sustained if it appeared from the record that the defendants, not joined, had been notified in writing and had refused to join.  In this case it appears by the record, that written notice was given to the co-defendants of O\'Dowd, and that they declined to join.  This was equivalent to summons and severance.</p>\n<p>It is also insisted that the motion to dismiss must be allowed, because the judgment was not final.  The judgment against Walker was reversed, because he was held not entitled to the exemption which he claimed under the Bankrupt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="405">Page 81 U. S. 405</a></p><p> Act, and the judgment against the sureties was affirmed, because they were held not entitled to the benefit of his discharge.  We think that both judgments were final, and that both are brought under review by the writ of error.</p>\n<p>Another reason assigned for dismissal is that the writ of error, the bond, the citation, and the copy of the writ of error for the defendants, were not seasonably served or filed.  It appears, from the record, that the judgment of the supreme court was rendered on the 31st of October, 1871, and on the 10th of November, 1871, a writ of error was issued returnable on the first Monday in December, and was served by filing in the clerk\'s office.  The writ is dated on the 16th of October, 1871.  This was before the judgment was affirmed, and is obviously a mistake.  It does not, however, vitiate the writ.  The case was removed by service on the 10th of November.</p>\n<p>The citation was served on the 3d of February, 1872.  This was sufficient to advise the opposite party that the cause had been removed to this Court, and was served and returned within the term.</p>\n<p>It does not, however, appear, from the record, that any copy of the writ was lodged for the defendants in error in the clerk\'s office of the supreme court.  It was necessary that such a copy should be filed within ten days to make the writ of error a supersedeas. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Nor does it appear when the bond was allowed and filed.  It bears date of the 10th of November.  The allowance is not dated; nor is its filing noted.</p>\n<p>We are of opinion, therefore, that a writ of error cannot operate as supersedeas, but the motion to dismiss must be</p>\n<p><em>Denied.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/77/416/case.html#418">77 U.
