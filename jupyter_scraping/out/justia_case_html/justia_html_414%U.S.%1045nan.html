After release, 4255 provides for a program of aftercare in the community. This aftercare, consisting of psychiatric, medical, and vocational support, was considered the crucial contribution of NARA to drug-addiction treatment. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] It is recognized that without such ongoing aftercare, the overwhelming majority of addicts return to their habits shortly after release from prison or voluntary drug-addiction programs. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p></p><p> Section 4252 undoubtedly preserves the discretion of the sentencing judge to refuse to apply the provisions of the NARA to even addicts who are \'eligible\' under 4251; the provisions of the NARA are available as an alternative and are not mandatory. See H.R. Rep.No.1486, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., in 1966 U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Adm.News, at 4249-4250, 4254. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1048">Page 414 U.S. 1045 , 1048</a></p><p> Nonetheless, it seems that Congress contemplated a more enlightened and less rigid approach to narcotics than was employed by the trial judge in the instant case. </p><p> The NARA was the product of extended consideration by the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Health, Education, and Welfare, which stressed the necessity for flexibility in dealing with the problem of drug addiction: </p><ul>\'These procedures mark a fundamental reorientation toward the problem of addition. The Attorney General in his testimony before the subcommittee stated that for too long the law had stressed punitive solutions and neglected medical and rehabilitative measures.</ul> <ul>\'. . . [T]he bill provides alternatives which provide a needed flexibility in the law. The practical effect of the implementation of the law provided for in the bill, is that strict punishment can be meted out where required to the hardened criminal, while justice can be tempered with judgment and fairness in those cases where it is to the best interest of society and the individual that such a course be followed.</ul> <ul>\'. . . The testimony presented at the hearings has clearly shown the need for the flexible approaches provided by civil commitment and post-conviction commitment which would be made possible by this legislation.\' Id., at 4249-4250.</ul> <p> Congress recognized that institutional treatment such as petitioner might receive in this case was ineffective, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1049">Page 414 U.S. 1045 , 1049</a></p><p> without more, in curing drug addiction, and that individuals will generally return to addiction when released from prison even if their physiological habits have been broken. It also explicitly acknowledged that addicts, like petitioner, will engage in criminal activity to support their habits and that they will often spread addiction to others. Id., at 4251; S.Rep.No.1667, 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 13. Weighing these considerations, Congress determined that even those who sold drugs, if they did so primarily to support their own habits, should be eligible for NARA consideration. The exception for addicts who sold to support their own habits was not created casually or without consideration. Hearings on Civil Commitment and Treatment of Narcotics Addicts before Subcomm. No. 2 of the House Judiciary Comm., 89th Cong., 1st &amp; 2d Sess., ser. 10, at 84- 85 (statement of Attorney General Katzenbach). It was felt that the exception did not endanger public safety or allow the NARA to be abused. See Hearings on the Narcotic Rehabilitation Act of 1966 before a Special Subcomm. of the Senate Judiciary Comm., 89th Cong., 2d Sess., 18 (1966) ( statement of Attorney General Katzenbach). </p><p> The District Court Judge in this case effectively wrote this congressional determination out of the NARA, since he apparently refused to extend the benefits of the Act to petitioner because petitioner had \'sold\' drugs. This was the ineffective and inflexible treatment into which judges were forced before the passage of the NARA and which Congress attempted to cure; it does not seem consonant with the congressional purpose to continue such simplistic treatment of the problem of addiction after the NARA is available. I would grant certiorari, vacate the judgment below, and remand the case for fuller consideration of the advisability of treatment under the NARA. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Petition for certiorari, at 11; Respondent\'s memorandum in opposition, at 3 n. 1. Similarly, the Solicitor General argues that discretion was properly exercised because petitioner was an \'active conduit\' of drugs who knew many drug wholesalers.

His body no longer requires the drug. But obviously, his underly emotional problems and the more immediate factors like environment and unemployment are as pressing as they ever were.</ul> <p> ...</p><ul>\'Clearly, neither voluntary commitment nor criminal imprisonment are working.
