Section 3(8) of the Act defines the term "occupational safety and health standard" as meaning a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, "reasonably necessary or appropriate" to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment.  Section 6(f) of the Act provides that the Secretary\'s determinations "shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole."  The Secretary, acting through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), promulgated the so-called Cotton Dust Standard limiting occupational exposure to cotton dust (an airborne particle byproduct of the preparation and manufacture of cotton products), exposure to which induces byssinosis, a serious and potentially disabling respiratory disease known in its more severe manifestations as "brown lung" disease.  Estimates indicate that at least 35,000 employed and retired cotton mill workers, or 1 in 12, suffer from the most disabling form of byssinosis, and 100,000 employed and retired workers suffer from some form of the disease.  The Standard sets permissible exposure levels to cotton dust for the different operations in the cotton industry.  Implementation of the Standard depends primarily on a mix of engineering controls, such as installation of ventilation systems, and work practice controls, such as special floor-sweeping procedures.  During the 4-year interim period permitted for full compliance with the Standard, employers are required to provide respirators to employees and to transfer employees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="491">Page 452 U. S. 491</a></p><p> unable to wear respirators to another position, if available, having a dust level that meets the Standard\'s permissible exposure limit, with no loss of earnings or other employment rights or benefits.  OSHA estimated the total industrywide cost of compliance as $656.5 million.  Petitioners, representing the cotton industry, challenged the validity of the Standard in the Court of Appeals, contending, <em>inter alia,</em> that the Act requires OSHA to demonstrate that the Standard reflects a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the Standard, that OSHA\'s determination of the Standard\'s "economic feasibility" was not supported by substantial evidence, and that the wage guarantee requirement was beyond OSHA\'s authority.  The Court of Appeals upheld the Standard in all major respects.  It held that the Act did not require OSHA to compare costs and benefits; that Congress itself balanced the costs and benefits in its mandate to OSHA under \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) to adopt the most protective feasible standard; and that OSHA\'s determination of economic feasibility was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  The court also held that OSHA had authority to require employers to guarantee employees\' wage and employment benefits following transfer because of inability to wear a respirator.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1. Cost-benefit analysis by OSHA in promulgating a standard under 6(b)(5) is not required by the Act because feasibility analysis is.

S. 506</a></span>-522.</p>\n<p>(a) The plain meaning of the word "feasible" is "capable of being done," and, thus, \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) directs the Secretary to issue the standard that most adequately assures that no employee will suffer material impairment of health, limited only by the extent to which this is "capable of being done."  In effect then, as the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits by placing the "benefit" of the worker\'s health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this "benefit" unachievable.  Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that strikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).

Even if the phrase "reasonably necessary or appropriate" in \xc2\xa7 3(8) might be construed to contemplate some balancing of costs and benefits, Congress specifically chose in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) to impose separate and additional requirements for issuance of standards dealing with such materials and agents:  it required that those standards be issued to prevent material health impairment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="492">Page 452 U.

To interpret \xc2\xa7 3(8) as imposing an additional and overriding cost-benefit analysis requirement on the issuance of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5)\'s "to the extent feasible" requirement.

There is no indication whatsoever that Congress intended OSHA to conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before promulgating a "toxic material" or "harmful physical agent" standard.  Rather, not only does the history confirm that Congress meant "feasible," rather than "cost-benefit," when it used the former term, but it also shows that Congress understood that the Act would create substantial costs for employers, yet intended to impose such costs when necessary to create a safe and healthful working environment.

They contend in this Court, as they did below, that the Act requires OSHA to demonstrate that its Standard reflects a reasonable relationship between the costs and benefits associated with the Standard.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Byssinosis is a "continuum . . . disease," 43 Fed.Reg. 27354, col. 2 (1978), that has been categorized into four grades. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In its least serious form, byssinosis produces both subjective symptoms, such as chest tightness, shortness of breath, coughing, and wheezing, and objective indications of loss of pulmonary functions.  <em>Id.</em> at 27352, col. 2.  In its most serious form, byssinosis is a chronic and irreversible obstructive pulmonary disease, clinically similar to chronic bronchitis or emphysema, and can be severely disabling.  <em>Ibid.</em>  At worst, as is true of other respiratory diseases, including bronchitis, emphysema, and asthma, byssinosis can create an additional strain on cardiovascular functions and can contribute to death from heart failure.  <em>See</em> Exhibit 6-73, App. 72 ("there is an association between mortality and the extent of dust exposure").  One authority has described the increasing seriousness of byssinosis as follows:</p>\n<p>"In the first few years of exposure [to cotton dust], symptoms occur on Monday, or other days after absence </p><p><a class="page-number" name="497">Page 452 U.

S. 501</a></p><p> of America, joined by the North Carolina Public Interest Research Group, petitioned the Secretary, urging a more stringent PEL of 100 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3.</p>\n<p>On December 28, 1976, OSHA published a proposal to replace the existing federal standard on cotton dust with a new permanent standard, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b)(5).  41 Fed.Reg. 56498.  The proposed standard contained a PEL of 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 of vertical elutriated lint-free respirable cotton dust for all segments of the cotton industry.  <em>Ibid.</em>  It also suggested an implementation strategy for achieving the PEL that relied on respirators for the short term and engineering controls for the long-term.  <em>Id.</em> at 5656, cols. 2 and 3.  OSHA invited interested parties to submit written comments within a 90-day period. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>Following the comment period, OSHA conducted three hearings in Washington, D.C., Greenville, Miss., and Lubbock, Tex., that lasted over 14 days.  Public participation was widespread, involving representatives from industry and the workforce, scientists, economists, industrial hygienists, and many others.  By the time the informal rulemaking procedure had terminated, OSHA had received 263 comments and 109 notices of intent to appear at the hearings.  43 Fed.Reg. 27351, col. 2 (1978).  The voluminous record, composed of a transcript of written and oral testimony, exhibits, and posthearing comments and briefs, totaled some 105,000 pages. 199 U.S.App.D.C. at 65, 617 F.2d at 647.  OSHA issued its final Cotton Dust Standard -- the one challenged in the instant case -- on June 23, 1978.  Along with an accompanying statement of findings and reasons, the Standard occupied 69 pages of the Federal Register.  43 Fed.Reg. 2735-27418 (1978); <em>see</em> 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1910.1043 (1980).</p>\n<p>The Cotton Dust Standard promulgated by OSHA establishes </p><p><a class="page-number" name="502">Page 452 U. S. 502</a></p><p> mandatory PEL\'s over an 8-hour period of 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for yarn manufacturing, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] 750 g/m^3 for slashing and weaving operations, and 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for all other processes in the cotton industry. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1910.1043(c) (1980).  These levels represent a relaxation of the proposed PEL of 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for all segments of the cotton industry.</p>\n<p>OSHA chose an implementation strategy for the Standard that depended primarily on a mix of engineering controls, such as installation of ventilation systems, [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] and work practice controls, such as special floor-sweeping procedures.  Full compliance with the PEL\'s is required within four years, except to the extent that employers can establish that the engineering and work practice controls are infeasible.  \xc2\xa7 1910.1043(e)(1).  During this compliance period, and at certain other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="503">Page 452 U. S. 503</a></p><p> times, the Standard requires employers to provide respirators to employees.  1910.1043(f).  Other requirements include monitoring of cotton dust exposure, medical surveillance of all employees, annual medical examinations, employee education and training programs, and the posting of warning signs.  A specific provision also under challenge in the instant case requires employers to transfer employees unable to wear respirators to another position, if available, having a dust level at or below the Standard\'s PEL\'s, with "no loss of earnings or other employment rights or benefits as a result of the transfer."  \xc2\xa7 1910.1043(f)(2)(v).</p>\n<p>On the basis of the evidence in the record as a whole, the Secretary determined that exposure to cotton dust represents a "significant health hazard to employees," 43 Fed.Reg. 27350, col. 1 (1978), and that "the prevalence of byssinosis should be significantly reduced" by the adoption of the Standard\'s PEL\'s, <em>id.</em> at 27359, col. 3.  In assessing the health risks from cotton dust and the risk reduction obtained from lowered exposure, OSHA relied particularly on data showing a strong linear relationship between the prevalence of byssinosis and the concentration of lint-free respirable cotton dust.  <em>Id.</em> at 27355-27359; Exhibit 6-51, App. 29-55.  <em>See also</em> Ex. 6-17, Ct. of App. J.A. 235-245; Ex. 38D, <em>id.</em> at 1492-1839.  Even at the 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL, OSHA found that the prevalence of at least Grade 1/1 byssinosis would be 137% of all employees in the yarn manufacturing sector.  43 Fed.Reg. 27359, cols. 2 and 3 (1978).</p>\n<p>In promulgating the Cotton Dust Standard, OSHA interpreted the Act to require adoption of the most stringent standard to protect against material health impairment, bounded only by technological and economic feasibility.  <em>Id.</em> at 27361, col. 3.  OSHA therefore rejected the industry\'s alternative proposal for a PEL of 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 in yarn manufacturing, a proposal which would produce a 25% prevalence of at least Grade 1/2 byssinosis.  The agency expressly found the Standard to be both technologically and economically feasible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="504">Page 452 U. S. 504</a></p><p> based on the evidence in the record as a whole.  Although recognizing that permitted levels of exposure to cotton dust would still cause some byssinosis, OSHA nevertheless rejected the union proposal for a 100 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL because it was not within the "technological capabilities of the industry."  <em>Id.</em> at 27359-27360.  Similarly, OSHA set PEL\'s for some segments of the cotton industry at 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 in part because of limitations of technological feasibility.  <em>Id.</em> at 27361, col. 3.  Finally, the Secretary found that "engineering dust controls in weaving may not be feasible even with massive expenditures by the industry,"  <em>id.</em> at 27360, col. 2, and, for that and other reasons, adopted a less stringent PEL of 750 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for weaving and slashing.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals upheld the Standard in all major respects. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  The court rejected the industry\'s claim that OSHA failed to consider its proposed alternative or give sufficient reasons for failing to adopt it. 199 U.S.App.D.C. at 70-72, 617 F.2d at 652-654.  The court also held that the Standard was "reasonably necessary and appropriate" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 3(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 652(8), because of the risk of material health impairment caused by exposure to cotton dust.  199 U.S.App.D.C. at 72-73, and n. 83, 617 F.2d at 654-655, and n. 83.  Rejecting the industry position that OSHA must demonstrate that the benefits of the Standard are proportionate to its costs, the court instead agreed with OSHA\'s interpretation that the Standard must protect employees against material health impairment, subject only to the limits of technological and economic feasibility.  <em>Id.</em> at 80-84, 617 F.2d at 662-666.  The court held that "Congress itself struck the balance between costs and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="505">Page 452 U. S. 505</a></p><p> benefits in the mandate to the agency" under \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b)(5), and that OSHA is powerless to circumvent that judgment by adopting less than the most protective feasible standard.  199 U.S.App.D.C. at 81, 617 F.2d at 663.  Finally, the court held that the agency\'s determination of technological and economic feasibility was supported by substantial evidence in the record as a whole.  <em>Id.</em> at 73-80, 617 F.2d at 655-662.</p>\n<p>We affirm in part, and vacate in part.

Relying on \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) and 3(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 655(b)(5) and 652(8), petitioner urge not only that OSHA must show that a standard addresses a significant risk of material health impairment, <em>see Industrial Union, Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#639">448 U.

[<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Respondents, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="507">Page 452 U. S. 507</a></p><p> on the other hand, contend that the Act requires OSHA to promulgate standards that eliminate or reduce such risks "to the extent such protection is technologically and economically feasible."  Brief for Federal Respondent 38; Brief for Union Respondents 227. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>] To resolve this debate, we must </p><p><a class="page-number" name="508">Page 452 U. S. 508</a></p><p> turn to the language, structure, and legislative history of the Act.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The starting point of our analysis is the language of the statute itself.  <em>Steadman v. SEC,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html">450 U. S. 91</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/91/case.html#97">450 U. S. 97</a></span> (1981); <em>Reiter v. Sonotone Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html">442 U. S. 330</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/330/case.html#337">442 U. S. 337</a></span> (1979).  Section 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b)(5) (emphasis added), provides:</p>\n<p>"The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, <em>to the extent feasible,</em> on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]"</p>\n<p>Although their interpretations differ, all parties agree that the phrase "to the extent feasible" contains the critical language in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) for purposes of these cases.</p>\n<p>The plain meaning of the word "feasible" supports respondents\' interpretation of the statute.  According to Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary of the English Language 831 (1976), "feasible" means "capable of being </p><p><a class="page-number" name="509">Page 452 U. S. 509</a></p><p> done, executed, or effected."  <em>Accord,</em> the Oxford English Dictionary 116 (1933) ("Capable of being done, accomplished or carried out"); Funk &amp; Wagnalls New "Standard" Dictionary of the English Language 903 (1957) ("That may be done, performed or effected").  Thus, \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) directs the Secretary to issue the standard that "most adequately assures . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health," limited only by the extent to which this is "capable of being done."  In effect, then, as the Court of Appeals held, Congress itself defined the basic relationship between costs and benefits by placing the "benefit" of worker health above all other considerations save those making attainment of this "benefit" unachievable.  Any standard based on a balancing of costs and benefits by the Secretary that strikes a different balance than that struck by Congress would be inconsistent with the command set forth in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).  Thus, cost-benefit analysis by OSHA is not required by the statute, because feasibility analysis is. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  <em>See Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#718">448 U.

S. 510</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.  One early example is the Flood Control Act of 1936, 33 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 71:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Federal Government should improve or participate in the improvement of navigable waters or their tributaries, including watersheds thereof, for flood-control purposes if the <em>benefits to whomsoever they may accrue are in excess of the estimated costs,</em> and if the lives and social security of people are otherwise adversely affected."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  A more recent example is the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act Amendments of 1978, 43 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1347(b) (1976 ed., Supp. III), providing that offshore drilling operations shall use</p>\n<p>"the best available and safest technologies which the Secretary determines to be economically <em>feasible,</em> wherever failure of equipment would have a significant effect on safety, health, or the environment, except where the Secretary determines that the <em>incremental benefits are clearly insufficient to justify the incremental costs of using such technologies.</em>"</p>\n<p>These and other statutes [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] demonstrate that Congress uses </p><p><a class="page-number" name="511">Page 452 U. S. 511</a></p><p> specific language when intending that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis.  <em>See Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#710">448 U. S. 710</a></span>, n. 27 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Certainly, in light of its ordinary meaning, the word "feasible" cannot be construed to articulate such congressional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="512">Page 452 U. S. 512</a></p><p> intent.   We therefore reject the argument that Congress required cost-benefit analysis in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Even though the plain language of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) supports this construction, we must still decide whether \xc2\xa7 3(8), the general definition of an occupational safety and health standard, either alone or in tandem with \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5), incorporates a cost-benefit requirement for standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents.  Section 3(8) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 652(8) (emphasis added), provides:</p>\n<p>"The term \'occupational safety and health standard\' means a standard which requires conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, <em>reasonably necessary or appropriate</em> to provide safe or healthful employment and places of employment."</p>\n<p>Taken alone, the phrase "reasonably necessary or appropriate" might be construed to contemplate some balancing of the costs and benefits of a standard.  Petitioners urge that, so construed, \xc2\xa7 3(8) engrafts a cost-benefit analysis requirement on the issuance of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) standards, even if \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) itself does not authorize such analysis.  We need not decide whether \xc2\xa7 3(8), standing alone, would contemplate some form of cost-benefit analysis.  For even if it does, Congress specifically chose in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) to impose separate and additional requirements for issuance of a subcategory of occupational safety and health standards dealing with toxic materials and harmful physical agents:  it required that those standards be issued to prevent material impairment of health <em>to the extent feasible.</em>  Congress could reasonably have concluded that <em>health</em> standards should be subject to different criteria than <em>safety</em> standards because of the special problems presented in regulating them.  <em>See Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#649">448 U.

S. 513</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Agreement with petitioners\' argument that \xc2\xa7 3(8) imposes an additional and overriding requirement of cost-benefit analysis on the issuance of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) standards would eviscerate the "to the extent feasible" requirement.  Standards would inevitably be set at the level indicated by cost-benefit analysis, and not at the level specified by \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).  For example, if cost-benefit analysis indicated a protective standard of 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL, while feasibility analysis indicated a 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL, the agency would be forced by the cost-benefit requirement to choose the less stringent point. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  We cannot believe that Congress intended the general terms of \xc2\xa7 3(8) to countermand the specific feasibility requirement of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).  Adoption of petitioners\' interpretation would effectively write \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) out of the Act.  We decline to render Congress\' decision to include a feasibility requirement nugatory, thereby offending the well-settled rule that all parts of a statute, if possible, are to be given effect.  <em>E.g., Reiter v.

The congressional Reports and debates certainly confirm that Congress meant "feasible," and nothing else, in using that term.  Congress was concerned that the Act might be thought to require achievement of absolute safety, an impossible standard, and therefore insisted that health and safety goals be capable of economic and technological accomplishment.  Perhaps most telling is the absence of any indication whatsoever that Congress intended OSHA to conduct its own cost-benefit analysis before promulgating a toxic material or harmful physical agent standard.  The legislative history demonstrates conclusively that Congress was fully aware that the Act would impose real and substantial costs of compliance on industry, and believed that such costs were part of the cost of doing business.  We thus turn to the relevant portions of the legislative history.</p>\n<p>Neither the original Senate bill, S. 2193, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), introduced by Senator Williams, nor the original House bill, H.R. 16785, 91st Cong., 2d Sess. (1970), introduced by Representative Daniels, included specific provisions </p><p><a class="page-number" name="515">Page 452 U. S. 515</a></p><p> controlling the issuance of standards governing toxic materials and harmful physical agents, Leg.Hist. 1, 6-7 (Williams bill); 721, 728-732 (Daniels bill), although both contained the definitional section enacted as \xc2\xa7 3(8). [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  The House Committee on Education and Labor, to which the Daniels bill was referred, reported out an amended bill that included the following section:</p>\n<p>"The Secretary, in promulgating standards under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, on the basis of the best available professional evidence, that no employee will suffer any impairment of health or functional capacity, or diminished life expectancy, even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 91-1291, p. 4 (1970) (to accompany H.R. 16785), Leg.Hist. 834.</p>\n<p>The Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare, reporting on the Williams bill, included a provision virtually identical to the House version, except for the additional requirement that the Secretary set the standard "which most adequately <em>and feasibly assures</em> . . . that no employee will suffer any impairment of health."  <em>Id.</em> at 242 (the Senate provision was numbered \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5)) (emphasis added).  This addition to the Williams bill was offered by Senator Javits, who explained his amendment:</p>\n<p>"As a result of this amendment, the Secretary, in setting standards, is expressly required to consider feasibility of proposed standards.  This is an improvement over the Daniels bill [as reported out of the House Committee], which might be interpreted to require <em>absolute</em> health and safety in all cases, regardless of feasibility, and the Administration bill, which contains no criteria for standards </p><p><a class="page-number" name="516">Page 452 U. S. 516</a></p><p> at all."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 91-1282, p. 58 (1970), Leg.Hist.197 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  Thus, the Senator\'s concern was that a standard might require "absolute health and safety" without any consideration as to whether such a condition was achievable.  The full Senate Committee also noted that standards promulgated under this provision "shall represent feasible requirements," S.Rep. No. 91-1282, at 7, Leg.Hist. 147, and commented that "[s]uch standards should be directed at assuring, <em>so far as possible,</em> that no employee will suffer impaired health. . . ," <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="517">Page 452 U. S. 517</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The final amendments to this Senate provision, resulting in \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Act, were proposed and adopted on the Senate floor after the Committee reported out the bill.  Senator Dominick, who played a prominent role in this amendment process, <em>see</em> 116 Cong.Rec. 37631 (1970), Leg.Hist. 526 (comments of Sen. Javits); 116 Cong.Rec. at 37631, Leg.Hist. 527 (comments of Sen. Williams), continued to be concerned that the Act might be read to require absolute safety.  He therefore proposed that the entire first sentence of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) be struck, explaining:</p>\n<p>"This requirement is inherently confusing and unrealistic.  It could be read to require the Secretary to ban all occupations in which there remains <em>some</em> risk of injury, impaired health, or life expectancy.  In the case of all occupations, it will be impossible to eliminate all risks to safety and health.  Thus, the present criteria could, if literally applied, close every business in this nation.  In addition, in many cases, the standard which might most \'adequately\' and \'feasibly\' assure the elimination of the danger would be the prohibition of the occupation itself."</p>\n<p>Leg.Hist. 367 (comments of Sen. Dominick on his proposed amendment No. 1054) (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>In the ensuing floor debate on this issue, Senator Dominick reiterated his concern that</p>\n<p>"[i]t is unrealistic to attempt as [the Committee\'s \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5)] apparently does, to establish a utopia free from any hazards.  Absolute safety is an impossibility. . . ."</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. 37614 (1970), Leg.Hist. 480. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  The Senator concluded:</p>\n<p>"Any administrator responsible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="518">Page 452 U. S. 518</a></p><p> for enforcing the statute will be faced with an impossible choice.  Either he must forbid employment in all occupations where there is any risk of injury, even if the technical state of the art could not remove the hazard, or he must ignore the mandate of Congress. . . ."</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. at 37614, Leg.Hist. 48182.</p>\n<p>Senator Dominick failed in his efforts to have the first sentence of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) deleted.  However, after working with Senators Williams and Javits, he introduced an amended version of the first sentence which he thought was "agreeable to all" and which became \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) as it now appears in the Act.  116 Cong.Rec. at 37622, Leg.Hist. 502.  This amendment limited the applicability of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) to "toxic materials and harmful physical agents," changed "health impairment" to "material impairment of health," and deleted the reference to "diminished life expectancy."  Significantly, the feasibility requirement was left intact in the statute.  Instead of the phrase "which most adequately and feasibly assures," the amendment merely substituted "which most adequately assures, to the extent feasible," to emphasize that the feasibility requirement operated as a limit on the promulgation of standards under \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5).</p>\n<p>Senator Dominick believed that his modifications made clearer that attainment of an absolutely safe working environment could not be achieved through "prohibition of the occupation itself," Leg.Hist. 367, and that toxic material and harmful physical agent standards should not address frivolous harms that exist in every workplace.  The feasibility requirement, along with the need for a "<em>material</em> impairment of health," were thus thought to satisfy these two concerns.  He explained the effect of the amendment:</p>\n<p>"What we were trying to do in the bill -- unfortunately, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="519">Page 452 U. S. 519</a></p><p> we did not have the proper wording or the proper drafting -- was to say that, when we are dealing with toxic agents or physical agents, we ought to take such steps as are feasible and practical to provide an atmosphere within which a person\'s health or safety would not be affected.  Unfortunately, we had language providing that anyone would be assured that no one would have a hazard. . . ."</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. 37622 (1970), Leg.Hist. 502.  Senator Williams added that the amendment</p>\n<p>"will provide a continued direction to the Secretary that he shall be required to set the standard which most adequately and, to the greatest extent feasible, assures"</p>\n<p>that no employee will suffer any material health impairment.  116 Cong.Rec. at 37622, Leg.Hist. 503.  The Senate thereafter passed S. 2193.  One week later, the House passed a substitute bill which failed to contain any substantive criteria for the issuance of health standards in place of its original bill.  116 Cong.Rec. at 38716-38717, Leg.Hist. 1094-1096.  At the joint House-Senate Conference, however, the House conferees acceded to the Senate\'s version of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5). [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>]</p>\n<p>Not only does the legislative history confirm that Congress meant "feasible," rather than "cost-benefit," when it used the former term, but it also shows that Congress understood that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="520">Page 452 U.

[<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>]  Congress viewed the costs of health and safety as a cost of doing business.  Senator Yarborough, a co-sponsor of the Williams bill, stated "We know the costs would be put into consumer goods, but that is the price we should pay for the 80 million workers in America."  116 Cong.Rec. at 37345, Leg.Hist. 444. He asked:</p>\n<p>"One may well ask too expensive for whom?  Is it too expensive for the company who, for lack of proper safety equipment, loses the services of its skilled employees?  Is it too expensive for the employee who loses his hand or leg or eyesight?  Is it too expensive for the widow trying to raise her children on meager allowance under workmen\'s compensation and social security?  And what about the man -- a good hardworking man -- tied to a wheel chair or hospital bed for the rest of his life?  That </p><p><a class="page-number" name="521">Page 452 U.

Senator Eagleton commented that</p>\n<p>"[t]he costs that will be incurred by employers in meeting the standards of health and safety to be established under this bill are, in my view, <em>reasonable and necessary costs of doing business.</em>"</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. at 41764, Leg.Hist. 1150-1151 (emphasis added). [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]</p>\n<p>Other Members of Congress voiced similar views. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  Nowhere is there any indication that Congress contemplated a different balancing by OSHA of the benefits of worker health and safety against the costs of achieving them.  Indeed  Congress thought that the <em>financial costs</em> of health and safety problems in the workplace were as large as or larger than the <em>financial costs</em> of eliminating these problems.  In its statement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="522">Page 452 U.

The Senate was well aware of the magnitude of these costs:</p>\n<p>"[T]he economic impact of industrial deaths and disability is staggering.  Over $1.5 billion is wasted in lost wages, and the annual loss to the Gross National Product is estimated to be over $8 billion.  Vast resources that could be available for productive use are siphoned off to pay workmen\'s compensation benefits and medical expenses."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 91-1282, p. 2 (1970), Leg.Hist. 142.  Senator Eagleton summarized:</p>\n<p>"Whether we, as individuals, are motivated by simple humanity or by simple economics, we can no longer permit profits to be dependent upon an unsafe or unhealthy worksite."</p>\n<p>116 Cong.Rec. 41764 (1970), Leg.Hist. 1150-1151.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 6(f) of the Act provides that "[t]he determinations of the Secretary shall be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole."  29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(f).  Petitioners contend that the Secretary\'s determination that the Cotton Dust Standard is "economically feasible" is not supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.  In particular, they claim (1) that OSHA underestimated the financial costs necessary to meet the Standard\'s requirements; and(2) that OSHA incorrectly found that the Standard would not threaten the economic viability of the cotton industry.</p>\n<p>In statutes with provisions virtually identical to \xc2\xa7 6(f) of the Act, we have defined substantial evidence as "such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html">Universal Camera Corp. v.

Therefore, our inquiry is not to determine whether we, in the first instance, would find OSHA\'s findings supported by substantial evidence.  Instead, we turn to OSHA\'s findings and the record upon which they were based to decide whether the Court of Appeals "misapprehended or grossly misapplied" the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>OSHA derived its cost estimate for industry compliance with the Cotton Dust Standard after reviewing two financial analyses, one prepared by the Research Triangle Institute (RTI), an OSHA-contracted group, the other by industry representatives (Hocutt-Thomas). [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  The agency carefully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="524">Page 452 U. S. 524</a></p><p> explored the assumptions and methodologies underlying the conclusions of each of these studies.  From this exercise, the agency was able to build upon conclusions from each which it found reliable and explain its process for choosing its cost estimate.  A brief summary of OSHA\'s treatment of the two studies follows.</p>\n<p>OSHA rejected RTI\'s cost estimate of $1.1 billion for textile industry engineering controls for three principal reasons. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  First, OSHA believed that RTI\'s estimate should be discounted by 30%, 43 Fed.Reg. 27372, col. 3 (1978), because that estimate was based on the assumption that engineering controls would be applied to all equipment in mills, including those processing pure synthetic fibers, even though cotton dust is not generated by such equipment.  RTI had observed that "[e]xclusion of equipment processing man-made fibers only could reduce these costs by as much as 30 percent."  Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 585. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  Since the Standard did not require controls on synthetics-only equipment, OSHA rejected RTI\'s assumption about application of controls to synthetics-only machines.  43 Fed.Reg. 27371, col. 3 (1978).  Second, OSHA concluded that RTI</p>\n<p>"may have overestimated compliance costs, since some operations are already in compliance with the permissible exposure limit of the new standard."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 27370, cols. 2 and 3.  Evidence indicated that some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="525">Page 452 U. S. 525</a></p><p> mills had attained PEL\'s of 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 or less, while others were below the 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 total dust level. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  Therefore, OSHA disagreed with RTI\'s assumption that the industry had not reduced cotton dust exposure below the existing standard\'s 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 total dust PEL.  <em>Id.</em> at 27370, col. 3.  Third, OSHA found that the RTI study suffered from lack of recent accurate industry data.  <em>Id.</em> at 27373, col. 1; <em>see</em> Ex. 76, Ct. of App. J.A. 88; Ex. 16., <em>id.</em> at 1367, 1359.</p>\n<p>In light of these deficiencies in the RTI study, OSHA adopted the Hocutt-Thomas estimate for textile industry engineering controls of $543 million, [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>] emphasizing that, because it was based on the most recent industry data, it was more realistic than RTI\'s estimate.  43 Fed.Reg. 27373, col. 1 (1978). [<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]  Nevertheless OSHA concluded that the Hocutt-Thomas </p><p><a class="page-number" name="526">Page 452 U. S. 526</a></p><p> estimate was overstated for four principal reasons.  First, Hocutt-Thomas included costs of achieving the existing PEL of 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3, while OSHA thought it likely that compliance was more widespread, and that some mills had in fact achieved the final standard\'s PEL.  <em>Ibid.; see</em> <a href="#F43" name="T43">n</a> 43, <em>supra.</em> [<a href="#F46" name="T46">Footnote 46</a>]  Second, Hocutt-Thomas declined to make any allowance for the trend toward replacement of existing production machines with newer more productive equipment. [<a href="#F47" name="T47">Footnote 47</a>]  Relying on this "[n]atural production tren[d]," 43 Fed.Reg. 27359, col. 1 (1978), OSHA concluded that fewer machines than estimated by Hocutt-Thomas would require retrofitting or other controls, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="527">Page 452 U. S. 527</a></p><p> <em>id.</em> at 27372, col. 3.  Third, OSHA thought that Hocutt-Thomas failed to take into account development of new technologies likely to occur during the 4-year compliance period.  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F48" name="T48">Footnote 48</a>]  Fourth, OSHA believed that Hocutt-Thomas might have improperly included control costs for synthetics-only machines, <em>ibid.,</em> an inclusion which could result in a 30% cost overestimate. [<a href="#F49" name="T49">Footnote 49</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners criticize OSHA\'s adopt.ion of the Hocutt-Thomas estimate, since that estimate was based on achievement of somewhat less stringent PEL\'s than those ultimately promulgated in the final Standard. [<a href="#F50" name="T50">Footnote 50</a>]  Thus, even if the Hocutt-Thomas estimate was exaggerated, they assert that</p>\n<p>"only by the most remarkable coincidence would the amount of that overestimate be equal to the additional costs required to attain the far more stringent limits of the Standard OSHA actually adopted."</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, p. 27; <em>see</em> Brief for Petitioner in No. 79-1583, pp. 14-15.  The agency itself recognized the problem cited by petitioners, but found itself limited in the precision of its estimates by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="528">Page 452 U. S. 528</a></p><p> industry\'s refusal to make more of its own data available. [<a href="#F51" name="T51">Footnote 51</a>]  OSHA explained that, "in the absence of the [industry] survey data [of textile mills], OSHA cannot develop more accurate estimates of compliance costs."  43 Fed. Reg 27373, col. 1 (1978).  Since \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Act requires that the Secretary promulgate toxic material and harmful physical agent standards "on the basis of the best available evidence," 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b)(5), and since OSHA could not obtain the more detailed confidential industry data it thought essential to further precision, we conclude that the agency acted reasonably in adopting the Hocutt-Thomas estimate. [<a href="#F52" name="T52">Footnote 52</a>]  While </p><p><a class="page-number" name="529">Page 452 U. S. 529</a></p><p> a cost estimate based on the standard actually promulgated surely would be preferable, [<a href="#F53" name="T53">Footnote 53</a>] we decline to hold as a matter of law that its absence, under the circumstances, required the Court of Appeals to find that OSHA\'s determination was unsupported by substantial evidence. [<a href="#F54" name="T54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>Therefore, whether or not in the first instance we would find the Secretary\'s conclusions supported by substantial evidence, we cannot say that the Court of Appeals in this case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="530">Page 452 U. S. 530</a></p><p> "misapprehended or grossly misapplied" the substantial evidence test when it found that "OSHA reasonably evaluated the cost estimates before it, considered criticisms of each, and selected suitable estimates of compliance costs."  199 U.S.App.D.C. at 79, 617 F.2d at 661 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>After estimating the cost of compliance with the Cotton Dust Standard, OSHA analyzed whether it was "economically feasible" for the cotton industry to bear this cost. [<a href="#F55" name="T55">Footnote 55</a>]  OSHA </p><p><a class="page-number" name="531">Page 452 U. S. 531</a></p><p> concluded that it was, finding that,</p>\n<p>"although some marginal employers may shut down, rather than comply, the industry as a whole will not be threatened by the capital requirements of the regulation."</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. 27378, col. 2 (1978); <em>see id.</em> at 27379, col. 3 ("compliance with the standard is well within the financial capability of the covered industries").  In reaching this conclusion on the Standard\'s economic impact, OSHA made specific findings with respect to employment, energy consumption, capital financing availability, and profitability.  <em>Id.</em> at 27377-27378.  To support its findings, the agency relied primarily on RTI\'s comprehensive investigation of the Standard\'s economic impact. [<a href="#F56" name="T56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>RTI evaluated the likely economic impact on the cotton industry and the United States\' economy of OSHA\'s original proposed standard, an across-the-board 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL.  Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 626. [<a href="#F57" name="T57">Footnote 57</a>] RTI had estimated a total </p><p><a class="page-number" name="532">Page 452 U. S. 532</a></p><p> compliance cost of $2.7 billion for a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL, [<a href="#F58" name="T58">Footnote 58</a>] and used this estimate in assessing the economic impact of such a standard.  <em>Id.</em> at 736-737.  As described in n.  <a href="#F44" name="T44">44</a> <em>supra,</em> OSHA estimated total compliance costs of $656.5 million for the final Cotton Dust Standard, [<a href="#F59" name="T59">Footnote 59</a>] a standard less stringent than the across-the-board 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL of the proposed standard.  Therefore, the agency found that the economic impact of its Standard would be "much less severe" than that suggested by RTI for a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL estimate of $2.7 billion.  43 Fed.Reg. 27378, col. 2 (1978).  Nevertheless, it is instructive to review RTI\'s conclusions with respect to the economic impact of a $2.7 billion cost estimate. RTI found:</p>\n<p>"Implementation of the proposed [200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3] standard will require adjustments within the cotton textile industry that will take time to work themselves out and that may be difficult for many firms.  In time, however, prices may be expected to rise and markets to adjust so that revenues will cover costs.  Although the impact on any one firm cannot be specified in advance, nothing in the RTI study indicates that the cotton textile industry as a whole will be seriously threatened by the impact of the proposed standard for control of cotton dust exposure."</p>\n<p>Ex. 16, Ct. of App. J.A. 1380; <em>id.</em> at 3620.  In reaching this conclusion, RTI analyzed the total and annual economic impact [<a href="#F60" name="T60">Footnote 60</a>] on each of the different sectors of the cotton industry. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="533">Page 452 U. S. 533</a></p><p></p>\n<p>For example, in yarn production (opening through spinning), RTI found that the total additional capital requirement per dollar of industry shipment was 7.8 cents, and that the corresponding annual requirement was 1.9 cents.  Ex. 676, <em>id.</em> at 729.  Average price increases necessary to maintain pre-standard rates of return on investment were estimated to range from 0.22 cents to 6.25 cents per dollar of industry sales. [<a href="#F61" name="T61">Footnote 61</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em>  Even assuming no price increases, only one of the six yarn-producing operations would experience a negative rate of return on investment, while the five other rates of return would range from l.4% to 3.9%.  <em>Id.</em> at 652. [<a href="#F62" name="T62">Footnote 62</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="534">Page 452 U. S. 534</a></p><p> RTI estimated the average pre-standard rate of return for the yarn-producing sector as 4.1%.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Through an output demand elasticity analysis, RTI determined that price increases necessitated by the 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 standard would result in a. 1.68% contraction of cotton yarn consumption. [<a href="#F63" name="T63">Footnote 63</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 685; <em>see id.</em> at 680-687.  RTI also discussed the effects of such price increases on interfiber and domestic/foreign competition.  RTI observed that "non-price factors have probably dominated" the competition between cotton and man-made fibers.  <em>Id.</em> at 623, 948-953. [<a href="#F64" name="T64">Footnote 64</a>]  Noting that international trade agreements restricting foreign imports of textile products "have tended to smother the effects of a small change in the relative prices of domestic versus foreign textile products," <em>id.</em> at 622, RTI concluded that such small </p><p><a class="page-number" name="535">Page 452 U. S. 535</a></p><p> changes have had "very little impact" on domestic industries and markets, <em>id.</em> at 961; <em>see id.</em> at 95961.  In order to measure the ability of different sized textile companies to finance compliance costs, RTI constructed a ratio of capital requirements to profit after taxes.  RTI found that two of the six yarn production operations would have financing difficulties, but that such difficulties decreased as company size increased.  <em>Id.</em> at 730. [<a href="#F65" name="T65">Footnote 65</a>]  Finally, impacts on energy costs, employment, inflation, and market structure were evaluated.  <em>See id.</em> at 72731. [<a href="#F66" name="T66">Footnote 66</a>]</p>\n<p>Relying on its comprehensive economic evaluation of the cotton industry\'s ability to absorb the $2.7 billion compliance cost of a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL standard, RTI concluded that "nothing in the RTI study indicates that the cotton textile industry as a whole will be seriously threatened."  Ex. 16, <em>id.</em> at 1380. [<a href="#F67" name="T67">Footnote 67</a>]  Therefore, it follows <em>a fortiori</em> that OSHA\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="536">Page 452 U. S. 536</a></p><p> estimated compliance cost of $656.6 million is "economically feasible." [<a href="#F68" name="T68">Footnote 68</a>]  Even if OSHA\'s estimate was understated, we are fortified in observing that RTI found that a standard more than four times as costly was nevertheless economically feasible.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals found that the agency "explained the economic impact it projected for the textile industry," and that OSHA has "substantial support in the record for its . . . findings of economic feasibility for the textile industry."  199 U.S.App.D.C. at 80, 617 F.2d at 662.  On the basis of the whole record, we cannot conclude that the Court of Appeals "misapprehended or grossly misapplied" the substantial evidence test.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The final Cotton Dust Standard places heavy reliance on the use of respirators to protect employees from exposure to cotton dust, particularly during the 4-year interim period necessary to install and implement feasible engineering controls. [<a href="#F69" name="T69">Footnote 69</a>]  One part of the respirator provision requires the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="537">Page 452 U. S. 537</a></p><p> employer to give employees unable to wear a respirator [<a href="#F70" name="T70">Footnote 70</a>] the opportunity to transfer to another position, if available, where the dust level meets the Standard\'s PEL.  2 CFR \xc2\xa7 1910.1043(f)(2)(v) (1980).  When such a transfer occurs, the employer must guarantee that the employee suffers no loss of earnings or other employment rights or benefits. [<a href="#F71" name="T71">Footnote 71</a>]  Petitioners do not object to the transfer provision, but challenge OSHA\'s authority under the Act to require employers to guarantee employees\' wage and employment benefits following the transfer.  The Court of Appeals held that OSHA has such authority.  199 U.S.App.D.C. at 93, 617 F.2d at 675.  We hold that, whether or not OSHA has this underlying authority, the agency has failed to make the necessary determination or statement of reasons that its wage guarantee </p><p><a class="page-number" name="538">Page 452 U. S. 538</a></p><p> requirement is related to the achievement of a safe and healthful work environment.</p>\n<p>Respondents urge several statutory bases for the authority exercised here.  They cite \xc2\xa7 2(b) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 651(b), which declares that the purpose of the Act is "to assure so far as possible every working man and woman in the Nation safe and healthful working conditions"; \xc2\xa7 2(b)(5), which suggests achievement of the purpose "by developing innovative methods, techniques, and approaches for dealing with occupational safety and health problems"; \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5), which requires the agency to "set the standard which most adequately assures . . . that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity . . ."; and \xc2\xa7 3(8), which provides that a standard must require</p>\n<p>"conditions, or the adoption or use of one or more practices, means, methods, operations, or processes, reasonably necessary or appropriate to provide safe or healthful employment."</p>\n<p>Brief for Federal Respondent 68.  Whatever methods these provisions authorize OSHA to apply, it is clear that such methods must be justified on the basis of their relation to safety or health.</p>\n<p>Section 6(f) of the Act, 29 U.S.C.  655(f), requires that "<em>determinations</em> of the Secretary" must be supported by substantial evidence.  Section 6(e), 29 U.S.C.  655(e), requires the Secretary to include "a statement of the reasons for such action, which shall be published in the Federal Register."

Following this Court\'s decision, OSHA deleted those provisions of the Cancer Policy which required the "automatic setting of the lowest feasible level" without regard to determinations of risk significance.  46 Fed.Reg. 4890, col. 1 (1981).</p>\n<p>In distinct contrast with its Cancer Policy, OSHA expressly found that "exposure to cotton dust presents a significant health hazard to employees," 43 Fed.Reg. 27350, col. 1 (1978), and that "cotton dust produced significant health effects at low levels of exposure," <em>id.</em> at 27358, col. 2.  In addition, the agency noted that</p>\n<p>"grade 1/2 byssinosis and associated pulmonary function decrements are significant health effects in themselves, and should be prevented in so far as possible."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 27354, col. 2.  In making its assessment of significant risk, OSHA relied on dose-response curve data (the Merchant Study) showing that 25% of employees suffered at least Grade 1/2 byssinosis at a 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL, and that 12.7% of all employees would suffer byssinosis at the 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL standard.  <em>Id.</em> at 27358, cols. 2 and 3.  Examining the Merchant Study in light of other studies in the record, the agency found that "the Merchant study provides a reliable assessment of health risk to cotton textile workers from cotton dust."  <em>Id.</em> at 27357, col. 3.  OSHA concluded that the "prevalence of byssinosis should be significantly reduced" by the 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL.  <em>Id.</em> at 27359, col. 3; <em>see id.</em> at 27359, col. 1 ("200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 represents a significant reduction in the number of affected workers").

They maintain that OSHA "is required to show that a reasonable relationship exists between the risk reduction benefits and the costs of its standards."  Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, p. 36.  Petitioners also suggest that OSHA must show that "the standard is expected to achieve a <em>significant reduction in</em> [the significant risk of material health impairment]" based on "an assessment of the costs of achieving it."  <em>Id.</em> at 38, 40.  Allowing that "[t]his does not mean that OSHA must engage in a rigidly formal cost-benefit calculation that places a dollar value on employee lives or health," <em>id.</em> at 39, petitioners describe the required exercise as follows:</p>\n<p>"First, OSHA must make a responsible determination of the costs and risk reduction benefits of its standard.  Pursuant to the requirement of Section 6(f) of the Act, this determination must be factually supported by substantial evidence in the record.  The subsequent determination whether the reduction in health risk is \'significant\' (based upon the factual assessment of costs and benefits) is a judgment to be made by the agency in the first instance."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 40.</p>\n<p>Respondent Secretary disputes petitioners\' description of the exercise, claiming that any meaningful balancing must involve "placing a [dollar] value on human life and freedom from suffering," Brief for Federal Respondent 59, and that there is no other way but through formal cost-benefit analysis to accomplish petitioners\' desired balancing, <em>id.</em> at 59-60.

This argument is more properly addressed to other provisions of the Act which may authorize OSHA to explore costs and benefits for deciding between issuance of several standards regulating different varieties of health and safety hazards, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7 6(g) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(g); <em>see Industrial Union Dept. v.

In addition, if the use of one respirator would achieve the same reduction in health risk as the use of five, the use of five respirators was "technologically and economically feasible," and OSHA thus insisted on the use of five, then the "reasonably necessary or appropriate" limitation might come into play as an additional restriction on OSHA to choose the one-respirator standard.

A review of the record belies this contention.  Senator .Javits himself had introduced the administration\'s bill, S. 2788, 91st Cong., 1st Sess. (1969), which he observed contained no criteria for issuance of standards.  Leg.Hist. 31, 39-42.  That proposed legislation, which established a National Occupational Safety and Health Board to promulgate standards, required the Board to submit proposed standards to an appropriate national standards-producing organization "to prepare a report on the technical feasibility, reasonableness and practicality of such standard."  <em>Id.</em> at 39.  Furthermore, either the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare could object to a proposed standard on the basis, <em>inter alia,</em> that it "is not feasible," <em>id.</em> at 40, at which point the Board could reaffirm the standard by a majority vote, <em>ibid.</em>  President Nixon\'s message accompanying S. 2788, which Senator Javits inserted in the Congressional Record, described the "report on the technical feasibility, reasonableness and practicality of such standard" under the Act as a "report on the feasibility of the proposed standards."  115 Cong.Rec. 22517 (1969).</p>\n<p>From this slim reed, petitioners fashion their legislative history argument.  But even if Senator Javits fully subscribed to statements by President Nixon on the proposed legislation, of which there is some doubt, <em>see id.</em> at 22512, this hardly supports the view that the Senator\'s addition of the feasibility requirement to the Williams bill included any such baggage.  After all, the Senator described his amendment only with the word "feasible," and specifically distinguished the amended Williams bill from the administration\'s on the basis of the latter\'s lack of criteria.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>Senator Dominick gave several examples.

Therefore RTI merely assumed that industrywide PEL\'s were at a 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 total dust PEL.  Ex. 6-76, <em>id.</em> at 579-580.  The record contains conflicting evidence on the actual level of control in the industry.

One expert, commenting on another study, observed that "substantial proportions of the industry are, in fact, within compliance of [200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3]."  <em>Id.</em> at 3637.  Other evidence in the record suggests that some segments of the industry are not in compliance with the 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 total dust PEL.  <em>See, e.g., id.</em> at 3939 (criticizing RTI assumption of compliance).  In any event, OSHA found that the "actual level of controls in the cotton industry could not be determined" on the basis of data available to RTI at the time of its study.  43 Fed.Reg. 27370, col. 3 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T44" name="F44">Footnote 44</a>]</p>\n<p>OSHA\'s cost estimate included $543 million for engineering controls (the Hocutt-Thomas estimate), $7 million for monitoring, medical surveillance, and other provisions (the RTI estimate), $31.5 million for waste processing, and $75 million for seed processing, for a total of $656.5 million.  <em>Id.</em> at 27380, col. 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T45" name="F45">Footnote 45</a>]</p>\n<p>The Hocutt-Thomas study based its estimates on data obtained from a recent ATMI survey of cotton mills.

Such manipulation of the data suggests a wide margin of error for any estimate, whether it be OSHA\'s, the industry\'s, or the unions\'.  Viewed in that light, the agency\'s candor in confessing its own inability to achieve a more precise estimate should not precipitate a judicial review that nonetheless demands what the congressionally delegated "expert" says it cannot provide.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T53" name="F53">Footnote 53</a>]</p>\n<p>The Secretary originally asked RTI to prepare cost estimates for several PEL levels, including 500, 200, and 100 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3.  Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 509.  Clearly the Secretary intended to have cost information on the different PEL\'s that he might promulgate.  Although RTI provided estimates for these levels in its final report, OSHA found them to be too unreliable to adopt as final estimates.  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#524">452 U. S. 524</a></span>-525.</p>\n<p>Even if the Secretary had wanted to obtain a cost estimate based on confidential industry data for the actual PEL\'s in the adopted Standard, he would have been unable to do so.  Hocutt had concluded that it was technologically impractical to achieve PEL\'s below 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for the operations of spinning through warping, Ex. 60, Ct. of App. J.A. 2239-2241, and PEL\'s below 1,000 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 for weaving and slashing, <em>id.</em> at 2241-2243.  Therefore, he declined to prepare cost estimates of a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL for those operations.  The Secretary obviously disagreed with his judgment of technological feasibility.  We also note that, although petitioners challenged the technological feasibility of the final Cotton Dust Standard in the Court of Appeals, they have abandoned such challenge here.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, p. 8, n. 16.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T54" name="F54">Footnote 54</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals observed that "the agency\'s underlying cost estimates are not free from imprecision," 199 U.S.App.D.C. at 80, 617 F.2d at 662, but that "[t]he very nature of economic analysis frequently imposes practical limits on the precision which reasonably can be required of the agency," <em>id.</em> at 79, 617 F.2d at 661.  We suspect that this results not only from the difficulty of obtaining accurate data, but also from the inherent crudeness of estimation tools.  Of necessity, both the RTI and Hocutt-Thomas studies had to rely on assumptions the truth or falsity of which could wreak havoc on the validity of their final numerical cost estimates.  As the official charged by Congress with the promulgation of occupational safety and health standards that protect workers "to the extent feasible," the Secretary was obligated to subject such assumptions to careful scrutiny, and to decide how they might affect the correctness of the proffered estimates.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T55" name="F55">Footnote 55</a>]</p>\n<p>In one of their questions presented, petitioners ATMI <em>et al.</em> ask whether</p>\n<p>"the statutory requirement that compliance with an OSHA standard must be \'economically feasible\' can be satisfied merely by the agency\'s conclusion that the standard will not put the affected industry out of business."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. in No. 79-1429, p. 2.  However, in argument in their brief, petitioners appear to treat this issue primarily as a substantial evidence question.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, pp. 24-31.  They finally summarize their position as follows:</p>\n<p>"OSHA must present a responsible prediction, supported by substantial evidence, of what its standard will cost and what impact it will have on such factors as production, employment, competition, and prices.  And the agency must explain in a cogent manner -- on the basis of intelligible criteria -- why it concludes that a standard having such an economic impact is \'feasible.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 35 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>As our review of OSHA\'s economic feasibility determination demonstrates, OSHA presented a "responsible prediction" of what its Standard would cost and its impact on "production, employment, competition, and prices."  The agency concluded that its Standard is feasible because "compliance with [it] is well within the financial capability of the covered industries."  43 Fed.Reg. 27379, col. 3 (1978).  OSHA also found that the industry "will be able to meet the demands for production of cotton products."  <em>Id.</em> at 27378, col. 2.  We take these findings to mean, as the Secretary suggests, that, "[a]t bottom, the Secretary must [and did] determine that the industry will maintain long-term profitability and competitiveness."  Brief for Federal Respondent 49.  <em>See also United Steelworkers of America v. Marshall,</em> 208 U.S.App.D.C. 60, 136, 647 F.2d 1189, 1265 (1981) ("the practical question is whether the standard threatens the competitive stability of an industry"); <em>Industrial Union Dept. v. Hodgson,</em> 162 U.S.App.D.C. at 342, 499 F.2d at 478.  This interpretation by the Secretary is certainly consistent with the plain meaning of the word "feasible."  <em>See Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#717">448 U. S. 717</a></span>-718, n. 30 (MARSHALL, J., dissenting).  Therefore, these cases do not present, and we do not decide, the question whether a standard that threatens the long-term profitability and competitiveness of an industry is "feasible" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Act, 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b)(5)</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T56" name="F56">Footnote 56</a>]</p>\n<p>In contrast to the compliance cost estimates prepared by RTI, OSHA did not find any major flaws with RTI\'s study of the economic impact of compliance costs.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T57" name="F57">Footnote 57</a>]</p>\n<p>RTI specifically analyzed the impact of the Standard on the following areas in the cotton industry:</p>\n<p>"1) Additional employment requirements."</p>\n<p>"2) Energy consumption."</p>\n<p>"3) Increases in production costs and consequent price increases by affected industries."</p>\n<p>"4) Capital requirements and capital financing problems."</p>\n<p>"5) Competition effects on profit and market structure."</p>\n<p>"6) Inflationary impact on consumers and U.S. economy."</p>\n<p>"7) Employment impact due to the contraction of output demand."</p>\n<p>Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 626.

The annualized capital charge consisted of depreciation, interest, administrative overhead, property tax, and insurance.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Depreciation and interest were computed</p>\n<p>"by use of a capital recovery factor based upon the concept of capital rent, the value of which depends on the operating life of the equipment and the market interest rate."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T61" name="F61">Footnote 61</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' primary criticism of OSHA\'s reliance on the RTI study derives from their disagreement with RTI\'s assumption that compliance costs would be passed on to the consumers.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, pp. 28-29.  This characterization misstates RTI\'s position.  In calculating price increases necessary to maintain pre-standard rates of return, RTI "decided to adopt an extreme assumption of zero price demand elasticity in computing post-control price increases" because of difficulties in obtaining data necessary to compute elasticities for cotton yarns.  Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 657.  However, RTI carefully tested this assumption to determine "how much bias" it would introduce into the analysis.  <em>Id.</em> at 657-659.  RTI concluded that,</p>\n<p>"unless the true demand elasticity for the output of the given sector is substantially greater than unity, our impact analysis based on the assumption of zero price elasticity of demand would not be invalidated."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 659.  Therefore, unless a 1% increase in price was met with substantially more than a 1% decrease in demand, RTI\'s estimates of the price increases necessary to maintain pre-standard rates of return were valid.  Since there was no evidence suggesting such an effect, RTI proceeded with its assumption.</p>\n<p>In any event, RTI subsequently investigated short-term price elasticities of demand for 25 cotton consumer products, finding that 19 of them had elasticities less than or equal to unity.  <em>Id.</em> at 681.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T62" name="F62">Footnote 62</a>]</p>\n<p>RTI found higher price increases and lower rates of return when framing its analysis in pounds of cotton yarn produced.  <em>See id.</em> at 654, 729-730.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T63" name="F63">Footnote 63</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioner National Cotton Council of America criticizes RTI\'s use of short-term price elasticity coefficients, claiming that this underestimates long-term demand responses to price increases.  Brief for Petitioner in No. 79-1583, pp. 16-17.  However, RTI\'s Dr. Lee, who conducted the elasticity analysis, observed that he used two independent procedures to compute demand contraction, and only one relied on short-term price elasticities.  Ct. of App. J.A. 3626-3627.  His "main procedure [was] input output table procedures," which produced an even smaller demand contraction estimate than those calculations relying on the short-term coefficients.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T64" name="F64">Footnote 64</a>]</p>\n<p>RTI cited such nonprice factors as "research expenditures, promotion and advertising, fiber and fabric development, fiber properties, and care characteristics of fabric."  Ex. 6-76, <em>id.</em> at 623.  John Figh, Chase Manhattan Bank vice-president, observed that</p>\n<p>"polyester has grown at the expense of cotton over the last 10 years, and I think it has penetrated most of the markets it can penetrate. . . .  [T]he majority of it, the growth of polyester at the expense of cotton, has been completed."</p>\n<p>App. 474-475.  He noted that some cotton products, such as towels and 100% cotton men\'s shirts, enjoy the support of consumer preferences.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although RTI cited the energy crisis without detailing its possible impact on man-made fiber products, Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 948, OSHA observed that changes in petroleum prices, a key ingredient in synthetic products, may have important impacts on the competitive balance, <em>see</em> 43 Fed.Reg. 27370, col. 2 (1978).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T65" name="F65">Footnote 65</a>]</p>\n<p>Two of the six yarn production operations had ratios less than 1, two had ratios less than 2, and the remaining two were less than 6.  Ex. 6-76, Ct. of App. J.A. 665.  Chase Manhattan Bank\'s John Figh agreed with RTI\'s assessment that financing the $2.7 billion compliance cost for a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL standard would be most difficult for smaller textile companies.  Ex. 63, <em>id.</em> at 2264-2265.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T66" name="F66">Footnote 66</a>]</p>\n<p>RTI conducted similar economic impact analyses, although in less depth, for the twisting through weaving and waste-processing sectors of the cotton industry covered by the proposed 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL standard.  Ex. 6-76, <em>id.</em> at 462.  RTI found, for example, that price increases per dollar of industry sales ranged from 0.5 cents to 18 cents for twisting through weaving operations, and that some of these operations would experience "severe" financing difficulties.  <em>Id.</em> at 733-734.  To recount in further detail these conclusions would be an irrelevant exercise.  RTI calculated that a 200 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 standard for weaving/slashing would cost $1.259 billion, <em>id.</em> at 600, and computed the economic impact based on that figure.  But RTI had also estimated that compliance costs for a 500 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL would be zero.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Since the final Cotton Dust Standard sets a 750 \xef\xbf\xbdg/m^3 PEL for weaving/slashing, further review of RTI\'s conclusion with respect to its $1.259 billion cost is particularly unnecessary.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T67" name="F67">Footnote 67</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners note that, although RTI estimated that compliance with the Cotton Dust Standard would take eight or more years, OSHA required compliance within four years.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, p. 29.  RTI chose an 8-year period primarily because of "problems the control industry may have in supplying the required equipment."  App. 415; <em>see id.</em> at 415-416.  If this proves to be the case, then presumably individual mills will be able to obtain variances from the Standard\'s requirements because of technological infeasibility.  <em>See</em> 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1910.1043(e)(1) (1980); 29 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 655(b).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T68" name="F68">Footnote 68</a>]</p>\n<p>Perhaps in light of this fact, neither petitioners ATMI <em>et al.</em> nor petitioner National Cotton Council of America frame their "economic impact" substantial evidence arguments based on OSHA\'s estimate of compliance costs.

S. 542</a></p><p> Everybody agrees that, under this statutory provision, the Cotton Dust Standard must at least be economically feasible, and everybody would also agree, I suppose, that, in order to determine whether or not something is economically feasible, one must have a fairly clear idea of how much it is going to cost.  Because I believe that OSHA failed to justify its estimate of the cost of the Cotton Dust Standard on the basis of substantial evidence, I would reverse the judgment before us without reaching the question whether the Act requires that a standard, beyond being economically feasible, must meet the demands of a cost-benefit examination.</p>\n<p>The simple truth about OSHA\'s assessment of the cost of the Cotton Dust Standard is that the agency never relied on any study or report purporting to predict the cost to industry of the Standard finally adopted by the agency.  OSHA did have before it one cost analysis, that of the Research Triangle Institute, which attempted to predict the cost of the final Standard.  However, as recognized by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#524">452 U. S. 524</a></span>-525, the agency flatly rejected that prediction as a gross overestimate.  The only other estimate OSHA had, the Hocutt-Thomas estimate prepared by industry researchers, was not designed to predict the cost of the final OSHA Standard.  Rather, it assumed a far less stringent and inevitably far less costly standard for all phases of cotton production except roving.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#527">452 U. S. 527</a></span>, n. 50.  The agency examined the Hocutt-Thomas study and concluded that it too was an overestimate of the costs of the less stringent standard it was addressing.  I am willing to defer to OSHA\'s determination that the Hocutt-Thomas study was such an overestimate, conceding that such subtle financial and technical matters lie within the discretion and skill of the agency.  But in a remarkable <em>non sequitur,</em> the agency decided that, because the Hocutt-Thomas study was an overestimate of the cost of a less stringent standard, it could be treated as a reliable estimate for the more costly final Standard actually promulgated, never rationally explaining how it came to this happy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="543">Page 452 U. S. 543</a></p><p> conclusion.  This is not substantial evidence.  It is unsupported speculation.</p>\n<p>Of course, as the Court notes, this Court will reexamine a court of appeals\' review of a question of substantial evidence "only in what ought to be the rare instance when the standard appears to have been misapprehended or grossly misapplied."  <em>Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html">340 U. S. 474</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/474/case.html#491">340 U. S. 491</a></span>.  But I think this is one of those rare instances where an agency has categorically misconceived the nature of the evidence necessary to support a regulation, and where the Court of Appeals has failed to correct the agency\'s error.  Of course, broad generalizations about the meaning of "substantial evidence" have limited value in deciding particular cases.  But within the confines of a single statute, where the agency and reviewing courts have identified certain specific factual matters to be proved, we can establish practical general criteria for comprehending "substantial evidence."</p>\n<p>Unlike the Court, I think it clear to the point of being obvious that, as a matter of law, OSHA\'s prediction of the cost of the Cotton Dust Standard lacks a basis in substantial evidence, since the agency did not rely on even a single estimate of the cost of the actual Standard it promulgated.  Accordingly, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom THE CHIEF JUSTICE joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p>A year ago I stated my belief that Congress, in enacting \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, unconstitutionally delegated to the Executive Branch the authority to make the "hard policy choices" properly the task of the legislature.  <em>Industrial Union Dept. v.

Because I continue to believe that the Act exceeds Congress\' power to delegate legislative authority to nonelected officials, <em>see <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/394/case.html">276 U. S. </a></span> W. Hampton  Co. v. United</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="544">Page 452 U.

Ryan,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/293/388/case.html">293 U. S. 388</a></span> (1935), I dissent.</p>\n<p>I will repeat only a little of what I said last Term.  Section 6(b)(5) provides in pertinent part:</p>\n<p>"The Secretary, in promulgating standards dealing with toxic materials or harmful physical agents under this subsection, shall set the standard which most adequately assures, <em>to the extent feasible,</em> on the basis of the best available evidence, that no employee will suffer material impairment of health or functional capacity even if such employee has regular exposure to the hazard dealt with by such standard for the period of his working life."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>As the Court correctly observes, the phrase "to the extent feasible" contains the critical language for the purpose of these cases.  We are presented with a remarkable range of interpretations of that language.  Petitioners contend that the statute requires the Secretary to demonstrate that the benefits of its "Cotton Dust Standard," in terms of reducing health risks, bear a reasonable relationship to its costs.  Brief for Petitioners in No. 79-1429, pp. 38-41.  Respondents, including the Secretary of Labor at least until his postargument motion, counter that Congress itself balanced costs and benefits when it enacted the statute, and that the statute prohibits the Secretary from engaging in a cost-benefit type balancing.  Their view is that the Act merely requires the Secretary to promulgate standards that eliminate or reduce such risks "to the extent . . . technologically or economically feasible."  Brief for Federal Respondent 38; Brief for Union Respondents 26-27.  As I read the Court\'s opinion, it takes a different position.  It concludes that, at least as to the "Cotton Dust Standard," the Act does not require the Secretary to engage in a cost-benefit analysis, which suggests, of course, that the Act permits the Secretary to undertake such an analysis if he so chooses.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#510">452 U. S. 510</a></span>-512. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="545">Page 452 U. S. 545</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Throughout its opinion, the Court refers to \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) as adopting a "feasibility standard" or a "feasibility requirement."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#508">452 U. S. 508</a></span>-522.  But as I attempted to point out last Term in <em>Industrial Union Dept. v. American Petroleum Institute, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#681">448 U. S. 681</a></span>-685, the "feasibility standard" is no standard at all.  Quite the contrary, I argued there that the insertion into \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) of the words "to the extent feasible" rendered what had been a clear, if somewhat unrealistic, statute into one so vague and precatory as to be an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Executive Branch.  Prior to the inclusion of the "feasibility" language, \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) simply required the Secretary to</p>\n<p>"set the standard which most adequately assures, on the basis of the best available professional evidence, that no employee will suffer any impairment of health. . . ."</p>\n<p>Legislative History, Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, p. 943 (Comm. Print 1971) (hereinafter Leg.Hist.).  Had that statute been enacted, it would undoubtedly support the result the Court reaches in these cases, and it would not have created an excessive delegation problem.  The Secretary of Labor would quite clearly have been authorized to set exposure standards without regard to any kind of cost-benefit analysis.</p>\n<p>But Congress did not enact that statute.  The legislative history of the Act reveals that a number of Members of Congress, such as Senators Javits, Saxbe, and Dominick, had difficulty with the proposed statute, and engaged Congress in a lengthy debate about the extent to which the Secretary should be authorized to create a risk-free work environment.  Congress had at least three choices.  It could have required the Secretary to engage in a cost-benefit analysis prior to the setting of exposure levels, it could have prohibited cost-benefit analysis, or it could have permitted the use of such an analysis.  Rather than make that choice and resolve that difficult policy issue, however, Congress passed.  Congress simply said that the Secretary should set standards "to the extent feasible."  Last year, JUSTICE POWELL reflected that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="546">Page 452 U. S. 546</a></p><p> "one might wish that Congress had spoken with greater clarity."  <em>American Petroleum Institute,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#668">448 U. S. 668</a></span> (POWELL, J., concurring in part and in judgment).  I am convinced that the reason that Congress did not speak with greater "clarity" was because it could not.  The words "to the extent feasible" were used to mask a fundamental policy disagreement in Congress.  I have no doubt that, if Congress had been required to choose whether to mandate, permit, or prohibit the Secretary from engaging in a cost-benefit analysis, there would have been no bill for the President to sign.</p>\n<p>The Court seems to argue that Congress <em>did</em> make a policy choice when it enacted the "feasibility" language.  Its view is that Congress required the Secretary to engage in something called "feasibility analysis."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#509">452 U. S. 509</a></span>.  But those words mean nothing at all.  They are a "legislative mirage, appearing to some Members [of Congress] but not to others, and assuming any form desired by the beholder."  <em>American Petroleum Institute, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#681">448 U. S. 681</a></span>.  Even the Court does not settle on a meaning.  It first suggests that the language requires the Secretary to do what is "capable of being done."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#508">452 U. S. 508</a></span>-509.  But if that is all the language means, it is merely precatory, and "no more than an admonition to the Secretary to do his duty. . . ."  Leg.Hist. 367 (remarks of Sen. Dominick).  The Court then seems to adopt the Secretary\'s view that feasibility means "technological and economic feasibility."  But there is nothing in the words of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5), or their legislative history, to suggest why they should be so limited.  One wonders why the "requirement" of \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) could not include considerations of administrative or even political feasibility.  As even the Court recognizes, when Congress has wanted to limit the concept of feasibility to technological and economic feasibility it has said so.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#510">452 U. S. 510</a></span>.  Thus, the words "to the extent feasible" provide no meaningful guidance to those who will administer the law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="547">Page 452 U. S. 547</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In believing that \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5) amounts to an unconstitutional delegation of legislative authority to the Executive Branch, I do not mean to suggest that Congress, in enacting a statute, must resolve all ambiguities or must "fill in all of the blanks."  Even the neophyte student of government realizes that legislation is the art of compromise, and that an important, controversial bill is seldom enacted by Congress in the form in which it is first introduced.  It is not unusual for the various factions supporting or opposing a proposal to accept some departure from the language they would prefer and to adopt substitute language agreeable to all.  But that sort of compromise is a far cry from this case, where Congress simply abdicated its responsibility for the making of a fundamental and most difficult policy choice -- whether and to what extent "the statistical possibility of future deaths should . . . be disregarded in light of the economic costs of preventing those deaths."  <em>American Petroleum Institute, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#672">448 U. S. 672</a></span>.  That is a "quintessential legislative" choice, and must be made by the elected representatives of the people, not by nonelected officials in the Executive Branch.  As stated last Term:</p>\n<p>"In drafting \xc2\xa7 6(b)(5), Congress was faced with a clear, if difficult, choice between balancing statistical lives and industrial resources or authorizing the Secretary to elevate human life above all concerns save massive dislocation in an affected industry.  That Congress recognized the difficulty of this choice is clear. . . .  That Congress chose, intentionally or unintentionally, to pass this difficult choice on to the Secretary is evident from the spectral quality of the standard it selected."</p>\n<p>448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/607/case.html#685">448 U. S. 685</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In sum, the Court is quite correct in asserting that the phrase "to the extent feasible" is the critical language for the purposes of these cases.  But that language is critical, not because it establishes a general standard by which those charged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="548">Page 452 U. S. 548</a></p><p> with administering the statute may be guided, but because it has precisely the opposite effect:  in failing to agree on whether the Secretary should be either mandated, permitted, or prohibited from undertaking a cost-benefit analysis, Congress simply left the crucial policy choices in the hands of the Secretary of Labor.<l=|452 ast2|="" u.s.="">*  As I stated at greater length last Term, I believe that, in so doing, Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative responsibility to the Executive Branch.</l=|452></p>\n<p>|452 U.S. ast2|</p>\n<p>* Contrary to the suggestion of the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/case.html#541">452 U.
