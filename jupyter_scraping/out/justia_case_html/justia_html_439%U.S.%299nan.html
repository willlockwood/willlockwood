JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether the National Bank Act, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5197, as amended, 12 U.S. C \xc2\xa7 5, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] authorizes a national bank based in one State to charge its out-of-state credit-card customers an interest rate on unpaid balances allowed by its home State, when that rate is greater than that permitted by the State of the bank\'s nonresident customers.  The Minnesota Supreme Court held that the bank is allowed by \xc2\xa7 85 to charge the higher rate.  262 N.W.2d 358 (1977).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The First National Bank of Omaha (Omaha Bank) is a national banking association with its charter address in Omaha, Neb. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Omaha Bank is a card-issuing member in the BankAmericard plan.  This plan enables cardholders to purchase goods and services from participating merchants and to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 439 U. S. 302</a></p><p> obtain cash advances from participating banks throughout the United States and the world.  Omaha Bank has systematically sought to enroll in its BankAmericard program the residents, merchants, and banks of the nearby State of Minnesota.  The solicitation of Minnesota merchants and banks is carried on by respondent First of Omaha Service Corp. (Omaha Service Corp.), a wholly owned subsidiary of Omaha Bank.  Minnesota residents are obligated to pay Omaha Bank interest on the outstanding balances of their BankAmericards.  Nebraska law permits Omaha Bank to charge interest on the unpaid balances of cardholder accounts at a rate of 18% per year on the first $999.99, and 12% per year on amounts of $1,000 and over. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Minnesota law, however, fixes the permissible annual interest on such accounts at 12%. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  To compensate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 439 U. S. 303</a></p><p> for the reduced interest, Minnesota law permits banks to charge annual fees of up to $15 for the privilege of using a bank credit card. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 439 U. S. 304</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The instant case began when petitioner Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis (Marquette), [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] itself a national banking association enrolled in the BankAmericard plan, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] brought suit in the District Court of Hennepin County, Minn., to enjoin Omaha Bank and Omaha Service Corp. from soliciting in Minnesota for Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program until such time as that program complied with Minnesota law. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Marquette claimed to be losing customers to Omaha Bank because, unlike the Nebraska bank, Marquette was forced by the low rate of interest permissible under Minnesota law to charge a $10 annual fee for the use of its credit cards.  App. 7a-15a, 45a-48a.</p>\n<p>Marquette named as defendants Omaha Bank, Omaha Service Corp., which is organized under the laws of Nebraska but qualified to do business and doing business in Minnesota, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and the Credit Bureau of St. Paul, Inc., a corporation organized under the laws of Minnesota having its principal office </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 439 U. S. 305</a></p><p> in St. Paul, Minn.  Omaha Service Corp. participates in Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program by entering into agreements with banks and merchants necessary to the operation of the BankAmericard scheme.  <em>Id.</em> at 30a.  At the time Marquette filed its complaint, Omaha Service Corp. had not yet entered into any such agreements in Minnesota, although it intended to do so.  <em>Id.</em> at 30a, 92a, 94a.  For its services, Omaha Service Corp. receives a fee from Omaha Bank, but it does not itself extend credit or receive interest. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 94a, 97a-110a.  It was alleged that the Credit Bureau of St. Paul, Inc., solicited prospective cardholders for Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program in Minnesota.  <em>Id.</em> at 9a, 30a.</p>\n<p>The defendants sought to remove Marquette\'s action to Federal District Court.  <em>See</em> 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 94. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Marquette responded by dismissing without prejudice its action against Omaha Bank, <em>see</em> Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 41(a)(1)(i), and the District Court, citing <em>Gully v. First Nat. Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/299/109/case.html">299 U. S. 109</a></span> (1936), remanded the case to the District Court of Hennepin County.  <em>Marquette Nat. Bank v. First Nat. Bank of Omaha,</em> 422 F.Supp. 1346 (Minn.1976).  Marquette thereupon moved for partial summary judgment to have Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program declared in violation of the Minnesota usury statute, Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.185 (1978), [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and permanently to enjoin the remaining defendants from engaging in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 439 U. S. 306</a></p><p> any activity in connection with the offering or operation of that program in further violation of Minnesota law.  Defendants argued that the National Bank Act, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5197, as amended, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 85, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] preempted Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.185 and enforcement of that statute against Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program.  Upon being notified of this challenge to Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.185, the Attorney General of the State of Minnesota [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] intervened as a party plaintiff and joined in Marquette\'s prayer for a declaratory judgment and permanent injunction.</p>\n<p>The District Court of Hennepin County granted plaintiffs\' motion for partial summary judgment, holding in an unreported opinion that</p>\n<p>"nothing contained in the National Bank Act, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 85, precludes or preempts the application and enforcement of Minnesota Statutes, \xc2\xa7 48.185 to the First National Bank of Omaha\'s BankAmericard program as solicited and operated in the State of Minnesota."</p>\n<p>App. 139a-140a.  The court enjoined Omaha Service Corp., "as agent of the First National Bank of Omaha," from</p>\n<p>"engaging in any solicitation of residents of the State of Minnesota or other activity in connection with the offering or operation of a bank credit card program in the State of Minnesota in violation of Minnesota Statutes, \xc2\xa7 48.185. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 140a-141a.</p>\n<p>On appeal, the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed.  Noting that Marquette\'s dismissal of Omaha Bank was a procedural device that removed the case from the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the Eighth Circuit, and noting that a recent decision of the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit had made it plain that, in its judgment, the usury laws of Nebraska, rather than Minnesota, should govern the operation of Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program in Minnesota, <em>see Fisher v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 439 U. S. 307</a></p><p> <em>First Nat. Bank of Omaha,</em> 548 F.2d 255 (1977), [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] the Minnesota Supreme Court concluded that it would be "inappropriate for this court to permit the use of procedural devices to obtain a result inconsistent with the existing doctrine in the Eighth Circuit." 22 N.W.2d at 365. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  Plaintiffs filed timely petitions for writs of certiorari, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] which we granted, 436 U.S. 916 (1978), in order to decide the appropriate application of 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 85.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In the present posture of this case, Omaha Bank is no longer a party defendant.  The federal question presented for decision is nevertheless the application of 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 85 to the operation of Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program.  There is no allegation in petitioners\' complaints that either Omaha Service Corp. or the Minnesota merchants and banks participating in the BankAmericard program are themselves </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 439 U. S. 308</a></p><p> extending credit in violation of Minn.Stat. \xc2\xa7 48.185 (1978), and we therefore have no occasion to determine the application of the National Bank Act in such a case.</p>\n<p>Omaha Bank is a national bank; it is an</p>\n<p>"instrumentalit[y] of the Federal government, created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States."</p>\n<p><em>Davis v. Elmira Savings Bank,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/275/case.html">161 U. S. 275</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/161/275/case.html#283">161 U. S. 283</a></span> (1896).  The interest rate that Omaha Bank may charge in its BankAmericard program is thus governed by federal law.  <em>See Farmers\' &amp; Mechanics\' Nat. Bank v. Dearing,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/29/case.html">91 U. S. 29</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/91/29/case.html#34">91 U. S. 34</a></span> (1875).  The provision of \xc2\xa7 85 called into question states:</p>\n<p>"Any association may take, receive, reserve, and charge on any loan or discount made, or upon any notes, bills of exchange, or other evidences of debt, interest at the rate allowed by the laws of the State, Territory, or District <em>where the bank is located,</em> . . . and no more, except that where by the laws of any State a different rate is limited for banks organized under State laws, the rate so limited shall be allowed for associations organized or existing in any such State under this chapter."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis supplied.)  Section 85 thus plainly provides that a national bank may charge interest "on any loan" at the rate allowed by the laws of the State in which the bank is "located."  The question before us is therefore narrowed to whether Omaha Bank and its BankAmericard program are "located" in Nebraska, and for that reason entitled to charge its Minnesota customers the rate of interest authorized by Nebraska law. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="309">Page 439 U. S. 309</a></p><p></p>\n<p>There is no question but that Omaha Bank itself, apart from its BankAmericard program, is located in Nebraska.  Petitioners concede as much.  <em>See</em> Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1258, p. 3; Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1265, pp. 3, 16, 33-34.  The National Bank Act requires a national bank to state in its organization certificate</p>\n<p>"[t]he place where its operations of discount and deposit are to be carried on, designating the State, Territory, or district, and the particular county and city, town, or village."</p>\n<p>Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 5134, 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 22.  The charter address of Omaha Bank is in Omaha, Douglas County, Neb.  The bank operates no branch banks in Minnesota, <em>cf. Seattle Trust &amp; Savings Bank v. Bank of California,</em> 492 F.2d 48 (CA9 1974), nor apparently could it under federal law. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  <em>See</em> 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 36(c). [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The State of Minnesota, however, contends that this conclusion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 439 U. S. 310</a></p><p> must be altered if Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericard program is considered:</p>\n<p>"In the context of a national bank which systematically solicits Minnesota resident for credit cards to be used in transactions with Minnesota merchants the bank must be deemed to be \'located\' in Minnesota for purposes of this credit card program."</p>\n<p>Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1258, p. 7.</p>\n<p>We disagree.  Section 85 was originally enacted as \xc2\xa7 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864, [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] 13 Stat. 108. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The congressional debates surrounding the enactment of \xc2\xa7 30 were conducted on the assumption that a national bank was "located" for purposes of the section in the State named in its organization certificate.  <em>See</em> Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 213-2127 (1864).  Omaha Bank cannot be deprived of this location merely because it is extending credit to residents of a foreign State.  Minnesota residents were always free to visit Nebraska and receive loans in that State.  It has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 439 U. S. 311</a></p><p> not been suggested that Minnesota usury laws would apply to such transactions.  Although the convenience of modern mail permits Minnesota residents holding Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericards to receive loans without visiting Nebraska, credit on the use of their cards is nevertheless similarly extended by Omaha Bank in Nebraska by the bank\'s honoring of the sales drafts of participating Minnesota merchants and banks. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Finance charges on the unpaid balances of cardholders </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 439 U. S. 312</a></p><p> are assessed by the bank in Omaha, Neb., and all payments on unpaid balances are remitted to the bank in Omaha, Neb.  Furthermore, the bank issues its BankAmericards in Omaha, Neb., after credit assessments made by the bank in that city.  App. 30a.</p>\n<p>Nor can the fact that Omaha Bank\'s BankAmericards are used "in transactions with Minnesota merchants" be determinative of the bank\'s location for purposes of \xc2\xa7 85.  The bank\'s BankAmericard enables its holder</p>\n<p>"to purchase goods and services from participating merchants and obtain cash advances from participating banks throughout the United States and the world."</p>\n<p>Stipulation of Facts, App. 91a.  Minnesota residents can thus use their Omaha Bank BankAmericards to purchase services in the State of New York or mail-order goods from the State of Michigan.  If the location of the bank were to depend on the whereabouts of each credit card transaction, the meaning of the term "located" would be so stretched as to throw into confusion the complex system of modern interstate banking.  A national bank could never be certain whether its contacts with residents of foreign States were sufficient to alter its location for purposes of \xc2\xa7 85.  We do not choose to invite these difficulties by rendering so elastic the term "located."  The mere fact that Omaha Bank has enrolled Minnesota residents, merchants, and banks in its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="313">Page 439 U. S. 313</a></p><p> BankAmericard program thus does not suffice to "locate" that bank in Minnesota for purposes of 12 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 85. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  <em>See Second Nat. Bank of Leavenworth v. Smoot,</em> 9 D.C. 371, 373 (1876).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Since Omaha Bank and its BankAmericard program are "located" in Nebraska, the plain language of \xc2\xa7 85 provides that the bank may charge "on any loan" the rate "allowed" by the State of Nebraska.  Petitioners contend, however, that this reading of the statute violates the basic legislative intent of the National Bank Act.  <em>See Train v. Colorado Public Interest Research Group,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/1/case.html">426 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/1/case.html#9">426 U. S. 9</a></span>-10 (1976).  At the time Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 30 of the National Bank Act of 1864, 13 Stat. 108, so petitioners\' argument runs, it intended "to insure competitive equality between state and national banks in the charging of interest."  Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1265, p. 24.  This policy could best be effectuated by limiting national banks to the rate of interest allowed by the States in which the banks were located.  Since Congress in 1864 was addressing a financial system in which incorporated banks were "local institutions," it did not "contemplate a national bank soliciting customers and entering loan agreements outside of the state in which it was established."  Brief for Petitioner in No. 77-1258, p. 17.  Therefore to interpret \xc2\xa7 85 to apply to interstate loans such as those involved in this case would not only enlarge impermissibly the original intent of Congress, but would also undercut the basic policy </p><p><a class="page-number" name="314">Page 439 U. S. 314</a></p><p> foundations of the statute by upsetting the competitive equality now existing between state and national banks.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept petitioners\' argument.  Whatever policy of "competitive equality" has been discerned in other sections of the National Bank Act, <em>see, e.g., First Nat. Bank v. Dickinson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/122/case.html">396 U.

National Bank of Missouri,</a></span></em> 18 Wall. 409, 413 (1874).  "National banks," it was said in <em>Tiffany,</em> "have been National favorites." [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  The policy of competitive equality between state and national banks, however, is not truly at the core of this case.  Instead, we are confronted by the inequalities that occur when a national bank applies the interest rates of its home State in its dealing with residents of a foreign State.  These inequalities affect both national and state banks in the foreign State.  Indeed, in the instant case, Marquette is a national bank claiming to be injured by the unequal interest rates charged by another national bank. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Whether the inequalities which thus occur when the interest rates of one State are "exported" into another violate the intent of Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 30 in part depends on whether Congress, in 1864, was aware of the existence of a system of interstate banking in which such inequalities would seem a necessary part.</p>\n<p>Close examination of the National Bank Act of 1864, its legislative history, and its historical context makes clear that, contrary to the suggestion of petitioners, Congress intended </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 439 U. S. 315</a></p><p> to facilitate what Representative Hooper [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>] termed a "national banking system."  Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1451 (1864).  <em>See also</em> Report of the Comptroller of the Currency 4 (1864).  Section 31 of the Act, for example, fully recognized the interstate nature of American banking by providing that three-fifths of the 15% of the aggregate amount of their notes in circulation that national banks were required to "have on hand, in lawful money" could</p>\n<p>"consist of balances due to an association available for the redemption of its circulating notes from associations approved by the comptroller of the currency, organized under this act, in the cities of Saint Louis, Louisville, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukie [<em>sic</em>], New Orleans, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburg, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston, New York, Albany, Leavenworth, San Francisco, and Washington City."</p>\n<p>13 Stat. 108, 109. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 439 U. S. 316</a></p><p> The debates surrounding the enactment of this section portray a banking system of great regional interdependence.  Senator Chandler of Michigan, for example, noted:</p>\n<p>"[T]he banking business of the Northwest is done upon bills of exchange.  The wool clip of Michigan, the wheat crop of Michigan, the hog crop of Iowa, are all purchased with drafts drawn chiefly upon [New York, Philadelphia, and Boston].  The wool clip is chiefly bought by drafts upon Boston.  I put in the three cities because it is convenient to the customer, to the broker, to the merchant, to be enabled to purchase a draft upon either one of these three places."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 2144 (1864). [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]  <em>See also id.</em> at 1343, 1376, 2143-2145, 2152, 2181-2182.  Similarly, the debates surrounding the enactment of \xc2\xa7 41 of the Act, which provided that the shares of a national bank could be taxed as personal property "in the assessment of taxes imposed by or under state authority at the place where such bank is located, and not elsewhere," 13 Stat. 112, demonstrated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 439 U. S. 317</a></p><p> a sensitive awareness of the possibilities of interstate ownership and control of national banks.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1271, 1898-1899 (1864).</p>\n<p>Although in the debates surrounding the enactment of \xc2\xa7 30 there is no specific discussion of the impact of interstate loans, these debates occurred in the context of a developed interstate loan market.  As early as 1839, this Court had occasion to note:</p>\n<p>"Money is frequently borrowed in one state by a corporation created in another.  The numerous banks established by different states are in the constant habit of contracting and dealing with one another. . . .  These usages of commerce and trade have been so general and public, and have been practiced for so long a period of time, and so generally acquiesced in by the states, that the Court cannot overlook them. . . ."</p>\n<p><em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html">Bank of Augusta v. Earle,</a></span></em> 13 Pet. 519,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/38/519/case.html#590">38 U. S. 590</a></span>-591 (1839).  Examples of this interstate loan market have been noted by historians of American banking.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 1 F. Redlich, The Molding of American Banking 49 (1968); 1 F. James, The Growth of Chicago Banks 546 (1938); Breckenridge, Discount Rates in the United States, 13 Pol.Sci.Q. 119, 136-138 (1898).  Evidence of this market is to be found in the numerous judicial decisions in cases arising out of interstate loan transactions.  <em>See, e.g., Woodcock v. Campbell,</em> 2 Port. 456 (Ala. 1835); <em>Clarke v. Bank of Mississippi,</em> 10 Ark. 516 (1850); <em>Planters Bank v. Bass,</em> 2 La.Ann. 430 (1847); <em>Knox v.

After passage of the National Bank Act of 1864, cases involving interstate loans begin to appear with some frequency in federal courts.  <em>See, e.g., In re Wild,</em> 29 F.Cas. 1211 (No. 17,645) (SDNY 1873); <em>Cadle v. Tracy,</em> 4 F.Cas. 967 (No. 2,279) (SDNY 1873); <em>Farmers\' Nat. Bank v. McElhinney,</em> 42 F. 801 (SD Iowa 1890); <em>Second Nat. Bank of Leavenworth v. Smoot,</em> 9 D.C. 371 (1876). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 439 U. S. 318</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We cannot assume that Congress was oblivious to the existence of such common commercial transactions.  We find it implausible to conclude, therefore, that Congress meant, through its silence, to exempt interstate loans from the reach of \xc2\xa7 30.  We would certainly be exceedingly reluctant to read such a hiatus into the regulatory scheme of \xc2\xa7 30 in the absence of evidence of specific congressional intent.  Petitioners have adduced no such evidence.</p>\n<p>Petitioners\' final argument is that the "exportation" of interest rates, such as occurred in this case, will significantly impair the ability of States to enact effective usury laws.  This impairment, however, has always been implicit in the structure of the National Bank Act, since citizens of one State were free to visit a neighboring State to receive credit at foreign interest rates. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  <em>Cf.</em> 38 Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 2123 (1864).  This impairment may, in fact, be accentuated by the ease with which interstate credit is available by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 439 U. S. 319</a></p><p> mail through the use of modern credit cards.  But the protection of state usury laws is an issue of legislative policy, and any plea to alter \xc2\xa7 85 to further that end is better addressed to the wisdom of Congress than to the judgment of this Court.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with No. 77-1258, <em>Minnesota v.

Under the old bill, a bank was not bound to redeem its issues except at its own counter.  If it failed to redeem there, then provision was made for winding it up.  Under the present bill, certain cities of the United States are designated where the banks are required to redeem their issues.  Each bank is to redeem its issue at its center of redemption as prescribed by the Comptroller of the Currency.  The cities named are the principal cities along the Atlantic coast, Cincinnati, Louisville, Chicago, Detroit, and two or three other places.  That will strengthen the system very much by relieving the noteholder from the trouble of going from any part of the United States to a remote village or city, and there demanding redemption at the counter of the bank."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1865 (1864).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T30" name="F30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>Senator Chandler was proposing all amendment to the provision of \xc2\xa7 31 which required every national bank located in the enumerated cities to</p>\n<p>"have on hand, in lawful money of the United States, an amount equal to at least twenty-five per centum of the aggregate amount of its notes in circulation and its deposits."</p>\n<p>13 Stat. 108.  The amendment read:</p>\n<p>"And one half of said twenty-five per cent. in banks organized under this act in the cities of St. Louis, Louisville, Chicago, Detroit, Milwaukee, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Pittsburg, and Portland may consist of balances due to the association available for the redemption of its circulating notes, from an association in the cities of New York, Boston, or Philadelphia."</p>\n<p>Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 2143 (1864).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T31" name="F31">Footnote 31</a>]</p>\n<p>When the National Bank Act of 1864 originally passed the House, it imposed a uniform maximum rate of interest of 7% on all national banks.  <em>See</em> Cong.Globe, 38th Cong., 1st Sess., 1866 (1864) (remarks of Sen.
