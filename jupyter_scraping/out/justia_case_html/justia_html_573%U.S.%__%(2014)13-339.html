Petitioner CTS Corporation sold property on which it had stored chemicals as part its operations as an electronics plant.  Twenty-four years later, respondents, the owners of portions of that property and adjacent landowners, sued, alleging damages from the stored contaminants.  CTS moved to dismiss, citing a state statute of repose that prevented subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s last culpable act.  Because CTS\xe2\x80\x99s last act occurred when it sold the property, the District Court granted the motion.

There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two, but their specified time periods are measured differently and they seek to attain different purposes and objectives.  Statutes of limitations are designed to promote justice by encouraging plaintiffs to pursue claims diligently and begin to run when a claim accrues.  Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should be free from liability after a legislatively determined amount of time and are measured from the date of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s last culpable act or omission.  The application of equitable tolling underscores their difference in purpose.  Because a statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x99 purpose is not furthered by barring an untimely action brought by a plaintiff who was prevented by extraordinary circumstances from timely filing, equitable tolling operates to pause the running of the statute.  The purpose of statutes of repose are unaffected by such circumstances, and equitable tolling does not apply.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (b)\xc2\xa0The text and structure of \xc2\xa79658 resolve this case.  Under that provision, pre-emption is characterized as an \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xception,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79658(a)(1), to the regular rule that the \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute of limitations established under State law\xe2\x80\x9d applies.  The \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement date\xe2\x80\x9d of which is subject to pre-emption, is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe period specified in a statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79658(b)(2).  That term appears four times, and \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear at all.  While it is apparent from the historical development of the two terms that their general usage has not always been precise, their distinction was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report that guided \xc2\xa79658\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, acknowledged the distinction, and urged the repeal of both types of statutes.  Because that distinction is not similarly reflected in \xc2\xa79658, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not intend to pre-empt statutes of repose. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Other textual features further support this conclusion.  It would be awkward to use the singular \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d to mandate pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes.  And the definition of that limitations period as \xe2\x80\x9cthe period\xe2\x80\x9d during which a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d under state law \xe2\x80\x9cmay be brought,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79658(b)(2), presupposes that a civil action exists.  A statute of repose, in contrast, can prohibit a cause of action from ever coming into existence.  Section 9658\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of a tolling rule also suggests that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling.  Respondents contend that \xc2\xa79658 also effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose create an obstacle to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purposes and objectives, see Wyeth v. Levine,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555\n\xe2\x80\x93564.  But the level of generality at which the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is framed affects whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose.  Here, where Congress chose to leave many areas of state law untouched, respondents have not shown that statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of statutory purposes.

Section 9658 applies to statutes of limitations governing actions for personal injury or property damage arising from the release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant into the environment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 9658 adopts what is known as the discovery rule.  Under this framework, statutes of limitations in covered actions begin to run when a plaintiff discovers, or reasonably should have discovered, that the harm in question was caused by the contaminant.  A person who is exposed to a toxic contaminant may not develop or show signs of resulting injury for many years, and so Congress enacted \xc2\xa79658 out of concern for long latency periods.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is undoubted that the discovery rule in \xc2\xa79658 pre-empts state statutes of limitations that are in conflict with its terms.

The Act provided a federal cause of action to recover costs of cleanup from culpable entities but not a federal cause of action for personal injury or property damage.  Instead, CERCLA directed preparation of an expert report to determine \xe2\x80\x9cthe ade-quacy of existing common law and statutory remedies in providing legal redress for harm to man and the environment caused by the release of hazardous substances into the environment,\xe2\x80\x9d including \xe2\x80\x9cbarriers to recovery posed by existing statutes of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa79651(e)(1), (3)(F).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The 1982 report resulting from that statutory directive proposed certain changes to state tort law.

(Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study Group Report or Report).  As relevant here, the Study Group Report noted the long latency periods involved in harm caused by toxic substances and \xe2\x80\x9crecommend[ed] that all states that have not already done so, clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at pt. 1, 256.  The Report further stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Recommendation is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim before he knows that he has one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress did not wait long for States to respond to some or all of the Report\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations.  Instead, Congress decided to act at the federal level.  Congress amended CERCLA in 1986 to add the provision now codified in \xc2\xa79658.  Whether \xc2\xa79658 repeals statutes of repose, as the Study Group Report recommended, is the question to be addressed here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The instant case arose in North Carolina, where CTS Corporation ran an electronics plant in Asheville from 1959 to 1985.  (A subsidiary, CTS of Asheville, Inc., ran the plant until 1983, when CTS Corporation took over.)  The plant manufactured and disposed of electronics and electronic parts.  In the process, it stored the chemicals trichloroethylene (TCE) and cis-1, 2-dichloroethane (DCE).  In 1987, CTS sold the property, along with a promise that the site was environmentally sound.  The buyer eventually sold portions of the property to individuals who, along with adjacent landowners, brought this suit alleging damage from contaminants on the land.  Those who alleged the injury and damage were the plaintiffs in the trial court and are respondents here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Their suit was brought in 2011, 24 years after CTS sold the property.  The suit, filed in the United\xc2\xa0States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, was a state-law nuisance action against CTS, petitioner here.  Respondents sought \xe2\x80\x9creclamation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ctoxic chemical contaminants\xe2\x80\x9d belonging to petitioner, \xe2\x80\x9cremediation of the environmental harm caused\xe2\x80\x9d by contaminants, and \xe2\x80\x9cmonetary damages in an amount that will fully compensate them for all the losses and damages they have suffered, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and will suffer in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 57a.

That statute prevents subjecting a defendant to a tort suit brought more than 10 years after the last culpable act of the defendant.  N. C. Gen. Stat.

The majority found \xc2\xa79658 \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d but also found that the interpretation in favor of pre-emption was preferable because of CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s remedial purpose.

She further indicated that, even \xe2\x80\x9cif the preemptive effect of \xc2\xa79658 were susceptible to two interpretations, a presumption against preemption would counsel that we should limit \xc2\xa79658\xe2\x80\x99s preemptive reach to statutes of limitations without also extending it to statutes of repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Courts of Appeals, as well as the Supreme Court of South Dakota, have rendered conflicting judgments on this question.

Statutes of limitations and statutes of repose both are mechanisms used to limit the temporal extent or duration of liability for tortious acts.  Both types of statute can operate to bar a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s suit, and in each instance time is the controlling factor.  There is considerable common ground in the policies underlying the two types of statute.  But the time periods specified are measured from different points, and the statutes seek to attain different purposes and objectives.  And, as will be explained, \xc2\xa79658 mandates a distinction between the two.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the ordinary course, a statute of limitations creates \xe2\x80\x9ca time limit for suing in a civil case, based on the date when the claim accrued.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1546 (9th ed. 2009) (Black\xe2\x80\x99s); see also Heimeshoff v.

Co., 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 4) (\xe2\x80\x9cAs a general matter, a statute of limitations begins to run when the cause of action \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9caccrues\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94that is, when  \xe2\x80\x98the plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Bay Area Laundry and Dry Cleaning Pension Trust Fund v. Ferbar Corp. of Cal., Inc.,\n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 192,\n201 (1997)\n)).  Measured by this standard, a claim accrues in a personal-injury or property-damage action \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the injury occurred or was discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1546.  For example, North Carolina, whose laws are central to this case, has a statute of limitations that allows a person three years to bring suit for personal injury or property damage, beginning on the date that damage \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes apparent or ought reasonably to have become apparent to the claimant, whichever event first occurs.\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0C.

That limit is measured not from the date on which the claim accrues but instead from the date of the last culpable act or omission of the defendant.  A statute of repose \xe2\x80\x9cbar[s] any suit that is brought after a specified time since the defendant acted (such as by designing or manufacturing a product), even if this period ends before the plaintiff has suffered a resulting injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1546.  The statute of repose limit is \xe2\x80\x9cnot related to the accrual of any cause of action; the injury need not have occurred, much less have been discovered.\xe2\x80\x9d  54 C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S., Limitations of Actions \xc2\xa77, p. 24 (2010) (hereinafter C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S.).

Statutes of limitations require plaintiffs to pursue \xe2\x80\x9cdiligent prosecution of known claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1546.  Statutes of limitations \xe2\x80\x9cpromote justice by preventing surprises through [plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] revival of claims that have been allowed to slumber until evidence has been lost, memories have faded, and witnesses have disappeared.\xe2\x80\x9d  Railroad Telegraphers v. Railway Express Agency, Inc.,\n\n321 U.\xc2\xa0S. 342\n\xe2\x80\x93349 (1944).  Statutes of repose also encourage plaintiffs to bring actions in a timely manner, and for many of the same reasons.  But the rationale has a different emphasis.  Statutes of repose effect a legislative judgment that a defendant should \xe2\x80\x9cbe free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. \xc2\xa77, at 24; see also School Board of Norfolk v.

Like a discharge in bankruptcy, a statute of repose can be said to provide a fresh start or freedom from liability.  Indeed, the Double Jeopardy Clause has been described as \xe2\x80\x9ca statute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d because it in part embodies the idea that at some point a defendant should be able to put past events behind him.

Statutes of limitations, but not statutes of repose, are subject to equitable tolling, a doctrine that \xe2\x80\x9cpauses the running of, or \xe2\x80\x98tolls,\xe2\x80\x99 a statute of limitations when a litigant has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7).  Statutes of repose, on the other hand, generally may not be tolled, even in cases of extraordinary circumstances beyond a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s control.  See, e.g., Lampf, supra, at 363 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] period of repose [is] inconsistent with tolling\xe2\x80\x9d); 4 C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71056, p. 240 (3d ed. 2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] critical distinction is that a repose period is fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7899, Comment g (1977).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Equitable tolling is applicable to statutes of limitations because their main thrust is to encourage the plaintiff to \xe2\x80\x9cpursu[e] his rights diligently,\xe2\x80\x9d and when an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance prevents him from bringing a timely action,\xe2\x80\x9d the restriction imposed by the statute of limitations does not further the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose.  Lozano, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 7).  But a statute of repose is a judgment that defendants should \xe2\x80\x9cbe free from liability after the legislatively determined period of time, beyond which the liability will no longer exist and will not be tolled for any reason.\xe2\x80\x9d  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. \xc2\xa77, at 24.  As an illustrative example, under North Carolina law statutes of limitations may be tolled but statutes of repose may not.  See, e.g., Monson v. Paramount Homes, Inc., 133 N.\xc2\xa0C.

The Court of Appeals was in error when it treated this as a substitute for a conclusion grounded in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure.  After all, almost every statute might be described as remedial in the sense that all statutes are designed to remedy some problem.  And even if the Court identified some subset of statutes as especially remedial, the Court has emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cno legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rodriguez v. United States,\n\n480 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522\n\xe2\x80\x93526 (1987) (per curiam).  Congressional intent is discerned primarily from the statutory text.  In any event, were the Court to adopt a presumption to help resolve ambiguity, substantial support also exists for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe States\xe2\x80\x99 coordinate role in government counsels against reading\xe2\x80\x9d federal laws such as \xc2\xa79658 \xe2\x80\x9cto restrict the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign capacity to regulate\xe2\x80\x9d in areas of traditional state concern.  FTC v. Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc., 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 18).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Turning to the statutory text, the Court notes first that \xc2\xa79658, in the caption of subsection (a), characterizes pre-emption as an \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xception\xe2\x80\x9d to the regular rule.  \xc2\xa79658(a)(1).  Section 9658 contains another subsection, with the heading \xe2\x80\x9cState law generally applicable,\xe2\x80\x9d that provides the rule that \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute of limitations established under State law shall apply.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79658(a)(2).  Under this structure, state law is not pre-empted unless it fits into the precise terms of the exception.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The statute defines the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement date\xe2\x80\x9d of which is subject to pre-emption, as a period specified in \xe2\x80\x9ca statute of limitations.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79658(b)(2).  Indeed, \xc2\xa79658 uses the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d four times (not including the caption), but not the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  This is instructive, but it is not dispositive.  While the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d has acquired a precise meaning, distinct from \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose,\xe2\x80\x9d and while that is its primary meaning, it must be acknowledged that the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d is sometimes used in a less formal way.  In that sense, it can refer to any provision restricting the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit.  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1546; see also Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder,\n\n425 U.\xc2\xa0S. 185,\n210 (1976)\n.  Congress has used the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d when enacting statutes of repose.  See, e.g., \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x936(h)(1)(B)(iii)(I)(aa) (2012 ed.) (creating a statute of repose and placing it in a provision entitled \xe2\x80\x9cStatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d);\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72278 (same).  And petitioner does not point out an example in which Congress has used the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  So the Court must proceed to examine other evidence of the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d as it is used in \xc2\xa79658.\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties debate the historical development of the terms \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d in an effort to show how these terms were likely understood in 1986, when Congress enacted \xc2\xa79658.  It is apparent that the distinction between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose was understood by some courts and scholars before 1986.  The 1977 Restatement of Torts noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n recent years special \xe2\x80\x98statutes of repose\xe2\x80\x99 have been adopted in some states\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  The statutory period in these acts is usually longer than that for the regular statute of limitations, but\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may have run before a cause of action came fully into existence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7899, Comment g.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But that usage, now predominant, then was not the only definition of the two terms.  One scholar, writing in 1981, described multiple usages of the terms, including both a usage in which the terms are equivalent and also the modern, more precise usage.  McGovern, The Variety, Policy and Constitutionality of Product Liability Statutes of Repose, 30 Am. U. L. Rev. 579, 584 (1981) (describing a statute of repose as \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct from a statute of limitation because [a statute of repose] begins to run at a time unrelated to the traditional accrual of the cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Respondents note that an entry in Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary from 1979 describes a statute of limitations as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cStatutes of limitations are statutes of repose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 835 (5th ed.).  That statement likely reflects an earlier, broader usage in which the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d referred to all provisions delineating the time in which a plaintiff must bring suit.  See, e.g., Pillow v. Roberts, 13 How. 472, 477 (1852) (\xe2\x80\x9cStatutes of limitation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are statutes of repose, and should not be evaded by a forced construction\xe2\x80\x9d); Rosenberg v. North Bergen, 61 N.\xc2\xa0J. 190, 201, 293 A.\xc2\xa02d 662, 667 (1972) (\xe2\x80\x9cAll statutes limiting in any way the time within which a judicial remedy may be sought are statutes of repose\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s 1077 (rev. 4th ed. 1968) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. declaring that no suit shall be maintained .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless brought within a specified period after the right accrued.  Statutes of limitation are statutes of repose\xe2\x80\x9d); Ballentine\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1233 (2d ed. 1948) (similar).  That usage does not necessarily support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation, because the broad usage of the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of repose\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean that the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to both types of statute.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        From all this, it is apparent that general usage of the legal terms has not always been precise, but the concept that statutes of repose and statutes of limitations are distinct was well enough established to be reflected in the 1982 Study Group Report, commissioned by Congress.  In one of its recommendations, the Study Group Report called on States to adopt the discovery rule now embodied in \xc2\xa79658.  Study Group Report, pt. 1, at 256.  The Report acknowledged that statutes of repose were not equivalent to statutes of limitations and that a recommendation to pre-empt the latter did not necessarily include the former.  For immediately it went on to state: \xe2\x80\x9cThe Recommendation is intended also to cover the repeal of the statutes of repose which, in a number of states[,] have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring [a] plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim before he knows that he has one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The scholars and professionals who were discussing this matter (and indeed were advising Congress) knew of a clear distinction between the two.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Report clearly urged the repeal of statutes of repose as well as statutes of limitations.  But in so doing the Report did what the statute does not: It referred to statutes of repose as a distinct category.  And when Congress did not make the same distinction, it is proper to conclude that Congress did not exercise the full scope of its pre-emption power.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        While the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cstatute of limitations\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa79658 is not dispositive, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s textual inquiry does not end there, for other features of the statutory text further support the exclusion of statutes of repose.  The text of \xc2\xa79658 includes language describing the covered period in the singular.  The statute uses the terms \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicable limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csuch period shall commence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe statute of limitations established under State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  This would be an awkward way to mandate the pre-emption of two different time periods with two different purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        True, the Dictionary Act states that \xe2\x80\x9cwords importing the singular include and apply to several persons, parties, or things\xe2\x80\x9d unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe context indicates otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71.  But the Court has relied on this directive when the rule is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98necessary to carry out the evident intent of the statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Hayes,\n\n555 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415\n, n.\xc2\xa05 (2009) (quoting First Nat. Bank in St.\xc2\xa0Louis v. Missouri,\n\n263 U.\xc2\xa0S. 640,\n657 (1924)\n).  As discussed, the context here shows an evident intent not to cover statutes of repose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Further, to return again to the definition of the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute describes it as \xe2\x80\x9cthe period\xe2\x80\x9d during which a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d under state law \xe2\x80\x9cmay be brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79658(b)(2). \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n         It is true that in a literal sense a statute of repose limits the time during which a suit \xe2\x80\x9cmay be brought\xe2\x80\x9d because it provides a point after which a suit cannot be brought.  Ibid.; see C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. \xc2\xa77, at 24 (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute of repose .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. limits the time within which an action may be brought\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the definition of the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d presupposes that \xe2\x80\x9ca [covered] civil action\xe2\x80\x9d exists.  \xc2\xa79658(b)(2).  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary defines a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil action\xe2\x80\x9d as identical to an \xe2\x80\x9caction at law,\xe2\x80\x9d which in relevant part is defined as a \xe2\x80\x9ccivil suit stating a legal cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s 32\xe2\x80\x9333, 279 (9th ed. 2009); see also id., at 222 (5th ed. 1979).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        A statute of repose, however, as noted above, \xe2\x80\x9cis not related to the accrual of any cause of action.\xe2\x80\x9d  C.\xc2\xa0J.\xc2\xa0S. \xc2\xa77, at 24.  Rather, it mandates that there shall be no cause of action beyond a certain point, even if no cause of action has yet accrued.  Thus, a statute of repose can prohibit a cause of action from coming into existence.  See, e.g., N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9352(16) (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]o cause of action shall accrue more than 10 years from the last act or omission of the defendant giving rise to the cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Hargett v. Holland, 337 N.\xc2\xa0C. 651, 654\xe2\x80\x93655, 447 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 784, 787 (1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute of repose creates an additional element of the claim itself which must be satisfied in order for the claim to be maintained\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  If the action is not brought within the specified period, the plaintiff literally has no cause of action\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); Lamb v. Wedgewood South Corp., 308 N.\xc2\xa0C. 419, 440\xe2\x80\x93441, 302 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 868, 880 (1983).  A statute of repose can be said to define the scope of the cause of action, and therefore the liability of the defendant.  See Hargett, supra, at 655\xe2\x80\x93656, 447 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 788.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In light of the distinct purpose for statutes of repose, the definition of \xe2\x80\x9capplicable limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus also the definition of \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement date\xe2\x80\x9d) in \xc2\xa79658(b)(2) is best read to encompass only statutes of limitations, which generally begin to run after a cause of action accrues and so always limit the time in which a civil action \xe2\x80\x9cmay be brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  A statute of repose, however, may preclude an alleged tortfeasor\xe2\x80\x99s liability before a plaintiff is entitled to sue, before an actionable harm ever occurs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Another and altogether unambiguous textual indication that \xc2\xa79658 does not pre-empt statutes of repose is that \xc2\xa79658 provides for equitable tolling for \xe2\x80\x9cminor or incompetent plaintiff[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa79658(b)(4)(B).  As noted in the preceding discussion, a \xe2\x80\x9ccritical distinction\xe2\x80\x9d between statutes of limitations and statutes of repose \xe2\x80\x9cis that a repose period is fixed and its expiration will not be delayed by estoppel or tolling.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71056, at 240.  As a consequence, the inclusion of a tolling rule in \xc2\xa79658 suggests that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s reach is limited to statutes of limitations, which traditionally have been subject to tolling.  It would be odd for Congress, if it did seek to pre-empt statutes of repose, to pre-empt not just the commencement date of statutes of repose but also state law prohibiting tolling of statutes of repose\xe2\x80\x94all without an express indication that \xc2\xa79658 was intended to reach the latter.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition to their argument that \xc2\xa79658 expressly pre-empts statutes of repose, respondents contend that \xc2\xa79658 effects an implied pre-emption because statutes of repose \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] an unacceptable \xe2\x80\x98obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Wyeth v.

Respondents argue that pre-emption of statutes of repose advances \xc2\xa79658\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, namely to help plaintiffs bring tort actions for harm caused by toxic contaminants.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the level of generality at which the statute\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is framed affects the judgment whether a specific reading will further or hinder that purpose.  CERCLA, it must be remembered, does not provide a complete reme-dial framework.  The statute does not provide a general cause of action for all harm caused by toxic contaminants.  Section 9658 leaves untouched States\xe2\x80\x99 judgments about causes of action, the scope of liability, the duration of the period provided by statutes of limitations, burdens of proof, rules of evidence, and other important rules governing civil actions.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The case for federal pre-emption is particularly weak where Congress has indicated its awareness of the operation of state law in a field of federal interest, and has nonetheless decided to stand by both concepts and to tolerate whatever tension there [is] between them.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Wyeth, supra, at 574\xe2\x80\x93575 (quoting Bonito Boats v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc.,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141\n\xe2\x80\x93167 (1989)).  Respondents have not shown that in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to leave those many areas of state law untouched, statutes of repose pose an unacceptable obstacle to the attainment of CERCLA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under a proper interpretation of \xc2\xa79658, statutes of repose are not within Congress\xe2\x80\x99 pre-emption mandate.  Although the natural reading of \xc2\xa79658\xe2\x80\x99s text is that statutes of repose are excluded, the Court finds additional support for its conclusion in well-established \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptions about the nature of pre-emption.\xe2\x80\x9d  Medtronic, Inc. v.

To ensure that latent injury claims would not become time barred during the years in which the injury remained without manifestation, Congress amended the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (CERCLA),\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79601 et\xc2\xa0seq., to include a provision, \xc2\xa79658, on \xe2\x80\x9cactions under state law for damages from exposure to hazardous substances.\xe2\x80\x9d  See H.

Captioned \xe2\x80\x9cException to State statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79658(a)(1) instructs that when the applicable state limitations period specifies \xe2\x80\x9ca commencement date .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. earlier than the federally required commencement date,\xe2\x80\x9d the federal date shall apply \xe2\x80\x9cin lieu of the date specified in [state law].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court in the case at hand identifies as the relevant prescriptive period North Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year repose provision.  I agree.  But as I see it, the later \xe2\x80\x9cfederally required commencement date,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79658(a)(1), (b)(4), displaces the earlier date state law prescribes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 9658(b)(3) defines \xe2\x80\x9ccommencement date\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe date specified in a statute of limitations as the beginning of the applicable limitations period.\xe2\x80\x9d  Under North Caro-lina law, that date is determined by the occurrence of\xe2\x80\x9cthe last act or omission of the defendant giving rise tothe [claim].\xe2\x80\x9d  N.\xc2\xa0C. Gen. Stat. Ann. 1\xe2\x80\x9352(16).  The definition key to this controversy, however, appears in \xc2\xa79658(b)(4)(A): \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[F]ederally required commencement date\xe2\x80\x99 means the date the plaintiff knew (or reasonably should have known) that [her] injury .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

At length, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion distinguishes statutes of limitations from statutes of repose.  See ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x9316.  Yet North Carolina itself made its repose period a component of the statute prescribing periods for \xe2\x80\x9cthe commencement of actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x9346, 1\xe2\x80\x9352(16).  What is a repose period, in essence, other than a limitations period unattended by a discovery rule?  See Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, Superfund Section 301(e) Study Group, Injuries and Damages from Hazardous Wastes\xe2\x80\x94Analysis and Improvement of Legal Remedies, 97th Cong., 2d Sess., (pt. 1) 255\xe2\x80\x93256 (Comm. Print 1982) (hereinafter Study Group Report).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The legislative history of \xc2\xa79658, moreover, shows why the distinction the Court draws between statutes of limitations and repose prescriptions cannot be what Congress ordered.  As the Court recognizes, ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, Congress amended CERCLA to include \xc2\xa79658 in response to the report of an expert Study Group commissioned when CERCLA was enacted.  That report directed its proposals to the States rather than to Congress.  It \xe2\x80\x9crecommend[ed] that the several states enhance and develop common law and statutory remedies, and that they remove unreasonable procedural and other barriers to recovery in court action for personal injuries resulting from exposure to hazardous waste.\xe2\x80\x9d  Study Group Report 255.  The report then made specific proposals.  Under the heading \xe2\x80\x9cStatutes of Limitations,\xe2\x80\x9d the Study Group proposed (1) \xe2\x80\x9cthat all [S]tates .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. clearly adopt the rule that an action accrues when the plaintiff discovers or should have discovered the injury or disease and its cause\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) that States repeal \xe2\x80\x9cstatutes of repose which, in a number of [S]tates have the same effect as some statutes of limitation in barring plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim before he knows he has one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 255\xe2\x80\x93256.  Both measures are necessary, the report explained, because \xe2\x80\x9cmany of the hazardous wastes are carcinogens\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9clatency period[s] for the appearance of injury or disease .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. likely to [run] for thirty years or more.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 255. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Beyond question, a repose period, like the 10-year period at issue here, will prevent recovery for injuries with la-tency periods running for decades.  Thus, altering statutes of limitations to include a discovery rule would be of little use in States with repose prescriptions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Rather than await action by the States, Congress decided to implement the Study Group\xe2\x80\x99s proposal itself by adopting \xc2\xa79658.  Ante, at 3.  The Conference Report relates the Study Group Report\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9ccertain State statutes deprive plaintiffs of their day in court\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the case of a long-latency disease, such as cancer,\xe2\x80\x9d a limitations period that begins to run before the plaintiff has discovered her injury frequently will make timely suit impossible.  Conference Report 261.  The Conference Report then states that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]his section\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xc2\xa79658\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9caddresses the problem identified in the [Study Group Report].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  As the Study Group Report makes clear, \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem\xe2\x80\x9d it identified, to which the Conference Report adverted, cannot be solved when statutes of repose remain operative.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation thus thwarts Congress\xe2\x80\x99 clearly expressed intent to fix \xe2\x80\x9cthe problem\xe2\x80\x9d the Study Group described. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In lieu of uniform application of the \xe2\x80\x9cfederally required commencement date,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa79658(b)(4), the Court allows those responsible for environmental contamination, if they are located in the still small number of States with repose periods,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]* to escape liability for the devastating harm they cause, harm hidden from detection for more than 10 years.  Instead of encouraging prompt identification and remediation of toxic contamination before it can kill, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision gives contaminators an incentive to conceal the hazards they have created until the repose period has run its full course.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Far from erring, see ante, at 2, 10, the Fourth Circuit,I am convinced, got it exactly right in holding that\xc2\xa79658 supersedes state law contrary to the federally required discovery rule.  I would affirm that court\xe2\x80\x99s sound judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t* \xc2\xa0See Conn.
