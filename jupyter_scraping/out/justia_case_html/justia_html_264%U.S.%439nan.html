JUSTICE BRANDEIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The owners of the steamship <em>Nyanza</em> filed in the federal court for Eastern Louisiana against Jahncke Dry Dock No. 1 and the owners thereof a single libel setting forth these four causes of action:  <em>in rem</em> for salvage, <em>in personam</em> for salvage, <em>in rem</em> for damage from collision, and <em>in personam</em> for such damage.  The owners appeared as claimants.  Excepting to the libel, they prayed that, "insofar as the action is either <em>in rem</em> or <em>in personam</em> for salvage and <em>in rem</em> for damage," it be dismissed for want of admiralty jurisdiction.  The court maintained the exception, entered a decree of dismissal precisely as prayed for, and allowed an appeal under \xc2\xa7 238 of the Judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 264 U. S. 440</a></p><p> Code, with a certificate that, "in this decree, the question of jurisdiction alone is in issue."</p>\n<p>The decree leaves the cause of action <em>in personam</em> for damage undisposed of.  For this reason, the appeal must be dismissed for want of jurisdiction in this Court, although the objection was not taken by the appellee.  This Court has jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 238, as under others, only of writs of error or appeals from final judgments.  And the judgment must be, not only in its nature final, but a complete disposition of the cause.  <em>Collins v. Miller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/364/case.html">252 U. S. 364</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/364/case.html#370">252 U. S. 370</a></span>.  This rule is applicable to appeals in admiralty.  <em>Bowker v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/186/135/case.html">186 U. S. 135</a></span>; <em>Oneida Nav. Corp. v. W. &amp; S. Job Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/252/239/case.html#251">252 U. S. 251</a></span>.  There is nothing to the contrary in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/72/819/case.html">Withenbury v. United States,</a></span></em> 5 Wall. 819, or in <em>The Pesaro,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/255/216/case.html">255 U.

Counsel suggested that the dismissal of this premature appeal might somehow release the dry dock, to libelant\'s prejudice.  It obviously cannot have that effect.</p>\n<p><em>Dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
