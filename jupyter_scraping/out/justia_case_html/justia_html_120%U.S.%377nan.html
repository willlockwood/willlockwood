Baker and the defendant Henrici succeeded him as trustees of said trust, and at the death of Baker in 1868, the defendants succeeded Baker and Henrici as trustees of said trust and managers of all the estate of the Harmony Society, and that Baker and Henrici, while such trustees, and the defendants ever since,</p>\n<p>"received and accepted the said trust fund, and all the profits and interest thereof, and all accretions of said fund received by them, not as their own, but in the same trust in which said Rapp had held said fund, and always recognized and acknowledged said trust, and always disclaimed any greater interest in said fund than any other contributor thereto; that the plaintiff did not know and had no means of ascertaining the names and places of abode of the other parties interested in said fund, but they were very numerous and their interest is common with his, and that neither Rapp nor either of the defendants ever rendered to the plaintiff or to any of the beneficiaries of said fund any account of their trust, although the plaintiff demanded an account of them and a settlement of his share therein before the bringing of this suit in May, 1882."</p>\n<p>The prayer of the bill was</p>\n<p>"that said trust be rescinded and held for naught as resting upon fraud and iniquity and being contrary to public policy and the laws of the land; that the persons interested in its assets be remitted to their original rights, the plaintiff included; that the defendants discover the names and places of abode of the other parties interested in the funds and property under the control of the defendants for the purpose that they may be brought before the court; that an account be taken of the said trust and assets and of the share of the plaintiff therein; that he have compensation for his contributions to said trust and to its assets; that a distribution of said assets be had, and that the plaintiff receive his share therein,"</p>\n<p>and for further relief.</p>\n<p>The defendants demurred to the bill, and assigned the following causes of</p>\n<p>"1st.  That it appears in and by said bill that more than fifty years have elapsed since the said alleged cause of complaint occurred to the plaintiff, whereby said cause of complaint </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 120 U. S. 385</a></p><p> path became barred by the statute of limitations in such cases made end provided."</p>\n<p>"2d.  That it appears in and by said bill of complaint that the causes of complaint are stale, and that so long a time has passed since the matters and things complained of took place that it would be contrary to equity and good conscience for a court to take cognizance thereof or to enforce any further or other answer thereto."</p>\n<p>"3d.  That no case is stated in said bill authorizing the court to grant the relief sought, or any other relief."</p>\n<p>The circuit court, without considering the first and third causes of demurrer, sustained the demurrer for the second cause assigned and dismissed the bill.  15 F. 753.

That no case is stated in said bill authorizing the court to grant the relief sought, or any other relief."</p>\n<p>The circuit court, without considering the first and third causes of demurrer, sustained the demurrer for the second cause assigned and dismissed the bill.  15 F. 753.  The plaintiff appealed to this Court, and having sine died, the appeal was prosecuted by his executors.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE GRAY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This bill was filed against the trustees of the Harmony Society, an unincorporated association of persons living together as a community, by a former member of the society claiming a share in property in the hands of the trustees.  The bill is sought to be maintained on the ground that the trust was not a charity in the legal sense, and the members of the society were equitable tenants in common of the property held in trust.  The learned counsel for the appellants differ in their views of the trust, the one insisting that it was unlawful because founded in fraud and against public policy, and should therefore be dissolved, and the other contending that it was a lawful and continuing trust.  We have not found it necessary to consider which of these is the sound view, because we are of opinion that the plaintiff did not show himself to be entitled to invoke the interposition of a court of equity. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 120 U. S. 386</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As a general rule, doubtless, length of time is no bar to a trust clearly established, and express trusts are not within the statute of limitations, because the possession of the trustee is presumed to be the possession of his <em>cestui que trust.</em> <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/19/481/case.html">Prevost v.

S. 388</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Harmony Society is a voluntary association, formed in 1805 by the plaintiff\'s parents and other heads of families who had emigrated from Germany under the leadership of one Rapp and become subject to his control in both spiritual and temporal affairs.  In that year, Rapp, for the purpose of acquiring absolute dominion over their means and mode of living, falsely and fraudulently represented to them that they could not be saved from eternal damnation except by renouncing the plan of a separate home for each family, yielding up all their possessions, as had been done by the early Christians, and laying them at the feet of Rapp as their apostle, to be put into a common fund of the society, and thenceforth living as a community under his control, receiving in return only the necessaries of life, and they, induced by and relying on his false and fraudulent representations, immediately yielded up all their possessions to the common fund of the society and placed the fund in his keeping as their trustee, and thenceforth lived as a community or common household, submitted themselves and their families to do for the community such work as he directed, allowed the avails thereof to form part of the common fund, and relinquished to him and his successors in the leadership of the community the management of the trust fund and the control of their own persons and those of their wives and children, and received only the necessaries of life in return.  Rapp received and accepted the trust fund, and all the accretions to it by the work of the inhabitants of the community or otherwise, not as his own, but in trust for the members of those families and the contributors to the fund, and for their common benefit, and always, up to his death in 1847, recognized and acknowledged said trust and disclaimed any greater interest in the fund than that of any other contributor and any other right to its management and control than by virtue of his leadership of the community.  In 1807, Rapp obliged his followers to abjure matrimony, and thenceforth did not permit them to marry in the community, and compelled anyone about to marry to leave it.  The plaintiff was born in the community in 1807, and was reared in and as a part of it, under Rapp\'s teachings and control, and faithfully </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 120 U. S. 389</a></p><p> worked for it from the age of twelve to the age of twenty-four years, and allowed the avails of his work to become part of the common fund, and received in return nothing but the necessaries of life, which were of far less value than the avails of his work, and in 1831, being about to marry, had to leave and did leave the community.  The trust fund so received and accepted by Rapp, with its profits, interest, and accretions, now amounts to $8,000,000, and yields an annual income of $200,000, and is held by the defendants on the same trust on which Rapp held it in his lifetime, and neither Rapp nor the defendants ever rendered any account to the plaintiff or to the beneficiaries of the fund, although the plaintiff, before bringing this suit in May, 1882, demanded of the defendants an account and a settlement of his share.</p>\n<p>The trust on which Rapp, and the defendants as his successors, held the common fund of the Harmony Society is described in one place in the bill as "for the members of said families and the contributors of said fund, and for their common benefit" -- that is to say, as is clearly explained by what goes before, in trust for their common benefit as a community, living together in the community, working for the community, subject to the regulations of the community, and supported by the community.  This was the "said trust" which, as the bill afterwards alleges, Rapp, up to his death, and his successors, until the bringing of this suit, "always recognized and acknowledged."  The constant avowal of the trustees that they held the trust fund upon such a trust is wholly inconsistent with and adverse to the claim of the plaintiff that they held the fund in trust for the benefit of the same persons as individuals, though withdrawn from the community, living by themselves, and taking no part in its work.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff, upon his own showing, withdrew from the community in 1831 and never returned to it, and for more than fifty years took no step to demand an account of the trustees or to follow up the rights which he claimed in this bill.  If he ever had any rights, he could not assert them after </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 120 U. S. 390</a></p><p> such a delay -- not on the ground of an express and lawful trust, because the express trust stated in the bill, and constantly avowed by the trustees during this long period, was wholly inconsistent with any trust which would sustain his claim; not on the ground that the express trust stated in the bill was unlawful and void, and therefore the trustees held the trust fund for the benefit of all the contributors in proportion to the amounts of their contributions, because that would be an implied or resulting trust, and barred by lapse of time.  In any aspect of the case, therefore, if it was not strictly within the statute of limitations, yet the plaintiff showed so little vigilance and so great laches that the circuit court rightly held that he was not entitled to relief in equity.</p>\n<p>It is proper to add that this decision does not rest in any degree upon the judgments of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania and of this Court in the cases cited at the bar in favor of the trustees of the Harmony Society in suits brought against them by other members, because each of those cases differed in its facts, and especially in showing that the society had written articles of association, which are not disclosed by this bill.  <em>Schriber v.
