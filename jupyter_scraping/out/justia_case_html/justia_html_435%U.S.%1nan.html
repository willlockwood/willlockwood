The District Court for the District of Puerto Rico held in these </p><p><a class="page-number" name="2">Page 435 U. S. 2</a></p><p> cases that this geographic limitation is unconstitutional as applied to persons who upon moving to Puerto Rico lost the benefits to which they were entitled while\' residing in the United States.  The Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, responsible for the administration of the Social Security Act, has appealed. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>One of the 1972 amendments to the Social Security Act created a uniform program, known as the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program, for aid to qualified aged, blind, and disabled persons.  86 Stat. 1465, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1381 <em>et seq.</em> (1970 ed., Supp. V).  This federally administered program replaced the federal-state programs of Old Age Assistance, 49 Stat. 620, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 301 <em>et seq.;</em> Aid to the Blind, 49 Stat. 645, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1201 <em>et seq.;</em> Aid to the Disabled, 64 Stat. 555, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1351 <em>et seq.;</em> and Aid to the Aged, Blind, and Disabled, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1381 <em>et seq.</em></p>\n<p>The exclusion of Puerto Rico in the amended program is apparent in the definitional section.  Section 1611(f) of the Act, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 132(f) (1970 ed., Supp. V), states that no individual is eligible for benefits during any month in which he or she is outside the United States.  The Act defines "the United States" as "the 50 States and the District of Columbia."  \xc2\xa7 1614(e), as set forth in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1382c(e) (1970 ed., Supp. V).  The repeal of the preexisting programs did not apply to Puerto Rico.  Thus, persons in Puerto Rico are not eligible to receive SSI benefits, but are eligible to receive benefits under the preexisting programs. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellee Torres received SSI benefits while residing in Connecticut; the benefits were discontinued when he moved </p><p><a class="page-number" name="3">Page 435 U. S. 3</a></p><p> to Puerto Rico.  Similarly, appellees Colon and Vega received benefits as residents of Massachusetts and New Jersey, respectively, but lost them on moving to Puerto Rico. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Torres filed a complaint in the District Court of Puerto Rico claiming that the exclusion of Puerto Rico from the SSI program was unconstitutional, and a three-judge court was convened to adjudicate the suit.  Viewing the geographic limitations in the law as an interference with the constitutional right of residents of the 50 States and the District of Columbia to travel, the court searched for  compelling governmental interest to justify such interference.  Finding none, the court held \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1611(f) and 1614(e) unconstitutional as applied to Torres.  <em>Torres v. Mathews,</em> 426 F.Supp. 1106. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Soon after that decision, appellees Colon and Vega also sued in the Puerto Rico District Court.  Relying on the <em>Torres</em> decision, a single judge enjoined the Social Security Administration from discontinuing their SSI benefits on the basis of their change of residency to Puerto Rico. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="4">Page 435 U. S. 4</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In <em>Shapiro v. Thompson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/case.html">394 U. S. 618</a></span> (1969), and <em>Memorial Hospital v. Maricopa County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/250/case.html">415 U. S. 250</a></span> (1974), this Court held that laws prohibiting newly arrived residents in a State or county from receiving the same vital benefits as other residents unconstitutionally burdened the right of interstate travel.  As the Court said in <em>Memorial Hospital,</em></p>\n<p>"the right of interstate travel must be seen as insuring new residents the same right to vital governmental benefits and privileges in the States to which they migrate as are enjoyed by other residents."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/415/250/case.html#261">415 U. S. 261</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the present cases, the District Court altogether transposed that proposition.  It held that the Constitution requires that a person who travels to Puerto Rico must be given benefits superior to those enjoyed by other residents of Puerto Rico if the newcomer enjoyed those benefits in the State from which he came.  This Court has never held that the constitutional right to travel embraces any such doctrine, and we decline to do so now. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Such a doctrine would apply with equal force to any benefits a State might provide for its residents, and would require a State to continue to pay those benefits indefinitely to any persons who had once resided there.  And the broader implications of such a doctrine in other areas of substantive law would bid fair to destroy the independent power of each </p><p><a class="page-number" name="5">Page 435 U. S. 5</a></p><p> State under our Constitution to enact laws uniformly applicable to all of its residents.</p>\n<p>If there ever could be a case where a person who has moved from one State to another might be entitled to invoke the law of the State from which he came as a corollary of his constitutional right to travel, this is surely not it.  For we deal here with a constitutional attack upon a law providing for governmental payments of monetary benefits.  Such a statute "is entitled to a strong presumption of constitutionality."  <em>Mathews v. De Castro,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/181/case.html">429 U.

Acceptance of that claim would have meant that all otherwise qualified persons in Puerto Rico are entitled to SSI benefits, not just those who received such benefits before moving to Puerto Rico.  But the District Court apparently acknowledged that Congress has the power to treat Puerto Rico differently, and that every federal program does not have to be extended to it.  Puerto Rico has a relationship to the United States "that has no parallel in our history."  <em>Examining Board v.

For purposes of this opinion, we may assume that there is a virtually unqualified constitutional right to travel between Puerto Rico and any of the 50 States of the Union.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>At least three reasons have been advanced to explain the exclusion of persons in Puerto Rico from the SSI program.  First, because of the unique tax status of Puerto Rico, its residents do not contribute to the public treasury.  Second, the cost of including Puerto Rico would be extremely great -- an estimated $300 million per year.  Third, inclusion in the SSI program might seriously disrupt the Puerto Rican economy.
