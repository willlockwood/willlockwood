See <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/index.html">419 U. S. 522</a>.  To establish a prima facie violation of the fair-cross-section requirement, a defendant must prove that: (1) a group qualifying as \xe2\x80\x9cdistinctive\xe2\x80\x9d (2) is not fairly and reasonably represented in jury venires, and (3) \xe2\x80\x9csystematic exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d in the jury-selection process accounts for the underrepresentation.  <em>Duren</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/index.html">439 U. S. 357</a>, 364.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At <em>voir dire</em> in the Kent County Circuit Court trial of respondent Smith, an African-American, the venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals, only 3 of whom, at most, were African-American.  At that time, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of the County\xe2\x80\x99s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.  The court rejected Smith\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the panel\xe2\x80\x99s racial composition, an all-white jury convicted him of second-degree murder and felony firearm possession, and the court sentenced him to life in prison with the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On order of the Michigan Court of Appeals, the trial court conducted an evidentiary hearing on Smith\xe2\x80\x99s fair-cross-section claim.  The evidence at the hearing showed, <em>inter alia,</em> that under the juror-assignment order in effect when Smith\xe2\x80\x99s jury was empaneled, the County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and, only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\xe2\x80\x99s.  Smith calls this procedure \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning.\xe2\x80\x9d  The month after Smith\xe2\x80\x99s <em>voir dire</em>, however, the County reversed course and adopted a Circuit-Court-first assignment order.  It did so based on the belief that the district courts took most of the minority jurors, leaving the Circuit Court with a jury pool that did not represent the entire County.  The trial court noted two means of measuring the underrepresentation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  First, the court described the \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute disparity\xe2\x80\x9d test, under which the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool (6%) is subtracted from the percentage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population (7.28%).  According to this measure, African-Americans were underrepresented by 1.28%.  Next, the court set out the \xe2\x80\x9ccomparative disparity\xe2\x80\x9d test, under which the absolute disparity (1.28%) is divided by the percentage of African-Americans in the jury-eligible population (7.28%).  The quotient (18%) indicated that, on average, African-Americans were 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on the jury-service list.  In the 11 months after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to 15.1%.  The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans were underrepresented on Circuit Court venires.  But Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, the trial court held, was insufficient to prove that the juror-assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had systematically excluded African-Americans.  The court therefore rejected Smith\xe2\x80\x99s fair-cross-section claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state intermediate appellate court reversed and ordered a new trial with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment order.  Reversing in turn, the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith had not established a prima facie Sixth Amendment violation.  This Court, the state High Court observed, has specified no preferred method for measuring whether representation of a distinctive group in the jury pool is fair and reasonable.  The court noted that lower federal courts had applied three tests: the absolute and comparative disparity tests and a standard deviation test.  Adopting a case-by-case approach allowing consideration of all three means of measuring underrepresentation, the court found that Smith had failed to establish a legally significant disparity under any measurement.  Nevertheless giving Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation, the court determined that he had not shown systematic exclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Smith then filed a federal habeas petition.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) prohibits federal habeas relief unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), or \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).  Finding no infirmity in the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision when assessed under AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s standards, the District Court dismissed Smith\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  The Sixth Circuit reversed.  The Court of Appeals ruled, first, that courts should use the comparative disparity test to measure underrepresentation where, as here, the allegedly excluded group is small.  The court then held that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s comparative disparity statistics demonstrated that African-Americans\xe2\x80\x99 representation in County Circuit Court venires was unfair and unreasonable.  It next stated that Smith had shown systematic exclusion.  In accord with the Michigan intermediate appellate court, the Sixth Circuit believed that the district-court-first assignment order significantly reduced the number of African-Americans available for Circuit Court venires.  Smith was entitled to relief, the Sixth Circuit concluded, because no important state interest supported the district-court-first allocation system.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The Sixth Circuit erred in ruling that the Michigan Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[ed] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  <em>Duren</em> hardly establishes\xe2\x80\x94no less \xe2\x80\x9cclearly\xe2\x80\x9d so\xe2\x80\x94that Smith was denied his Sixth Amendment right to an impartial jury drawn from a fair cross section of the community.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The <em>Duren </em>defendant readily met all three parts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie test when he complained of the dearth of women in a county\xe2\x80\x99s jury pool.  First, he showed that women in the county were both \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous and distinct from men.\xe2\x80\x9d  439 U. S., at 364.  Second, to establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of those summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of those on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn.  <em>Id., </em>at 364\xe2\x80\x93366.  Finally, to show the \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the underrepresentation, he pointed to Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s law permitting any woman to opt out of jury service and to the manner in which the county administered that law.  This Court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cappropriately tailored\xe2\x80\x9d hardship exemptions would likely survive a fair-cross-section challenge if justified by an important state interest, <em>id.,</em> at 370, but concluded that no such interest could justify the exemption for each and every woman, <em>id.,</em> at 369\xe2\x80\x93370.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Duren</em> nor any other decision of this Court specifies the method or test courts must use to measure underrepresentation.  Each of the three methods employed or identified by the courts below\xe2\x80\x94absolute disparity, comparative disparity, and standard deviation\xe2\x80\x94is imperfect.  Absolute disparity and comparative disparity measurements can be misleading where, as here, members of the distinctive group compose only a small percentage of the community\xe2\x80\x99s jury-eligible population.  And it appears that no court has relied exclusively on a standard deviation analysis.  Even absent AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s constraint, this Court would have no cause to take sides here on the appropriate method or methods for measuring underrepresentation.  Although the Michigan Supreme Court concluded that Smith\xe2\x80\x99s statistical evidence failed to establish a legally significant disparity under either the absolute or comparative disparity tests, the court nevertheless gave Smith the benefit of the doubt on underrepresentation in order to reach the issue ultimately dispositive in <em>Duren</em>: To the extent underrepresentation existed, was it due to \xe2\x80\x9csystematic exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d?  See <em>Duren</em>, 439 U. S., at 364.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9313. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had any significant effect on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  Although the record established that some County officials <em>believed </em>that the assignment order created racial disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, the belief was not substantiated by Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.  He introduced no evidence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x99s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the District Court for Grand Rapids, which had the County\xe2\x80\x99s largest African-American population.  He did not address whether Grand Rapids had more need for jurors per capita than any other district in Kent County.  And he did not compare the African-American representation levels on Circuit Court venires with those on the Federal District Court venires for the same region.  See <em>Duren</em>, 439 U. S., at 367, n.\xc2\xa025.  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s best evidence of systematic exclusion was the decline in comparative underrepresentation, from 18 to 15.1%, after Kent County reversed its assignment order.  But that evidence indicated no large change and was, in any event, insufficient to prove that the original assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.  Pp. 13\xe2\x80\x9314. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0In addition to renewing his \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning\xe2\x80\x9d argument, Smith urges that a laundry list of factors\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> the County\xe2\x80\x99s practice of excusing prospective jurors without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appear\xe2\x80\x94combined to reduce systematically the number of African-Americans appearing on jury lists.  No \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d precedent of this Court supports Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Smith urges that one sentence in <em>Duren,</em> 439 U. S., at 368\xe2\x80\x93369, places the burden of proving causation on the State.  But Smith clipped that sentence from its context: The sentence does not concern the demonstration of a prima face case; instead, it speaks to what the State might show <em>to rebut</em> the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case.  The Michigan Supreme Court was therefore far from \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), in concluding that <em>Duren </em>first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrepresentation complained of was due to systematic exclusion.  This Court, furthermore, has never \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d that jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\xe2\x80\x99s list can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim.  Rather, the <em>Taylor</em> Court \xe2\x80\x9crecognized broad discretion in the States\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe relevant qualifications for their jurors and to provide reasonable exemptions.\xe2\x80\x9d  419 U. S., at 537\xe2\x80\x93538.  And in <em>Duren</em>, the Court understood that hardship exemptions resembling those Smith assails might well \xe2\x80\x9csurvive a fair-cross-section challenge.\xe2\x80\x9d  439 U. S., at 370.

See <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/index.html">419 U. S. 522</a> (1975).  The question presented in this case is whether that right was accorded to respondent Diapolis Smith, an African-American convicted of second-degree murder by an all-white jury in Kent County, Michigan in 1993.  At the time of Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial, African-Americans constituted 7.28% of Kent County\xe2\x80\x99s jury-eligible population, and 6% of the pool from which potential jurors were drawn.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Duren</em> v. <em>Missouri</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/357/index.html"></a><a href="/us/439/357/index.html">439 U. S. 357</a> (1979), this Court described three showings a criminal defendant must make to establish a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s fair-cross-section requirement.  He or she must show: \xe2\x80\x9c(1) that the group alleged to be excluded is a \xe2\x80\x98distinctive\xe2\x80\x99 group in the community; (2) that the representation of this group in venires from which juries are selected is not fair and reasonable in relation to the number of such persons in the community; and (3) that this underrepresentation is due to systematic exclusion of the group in the jury-selection process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 364.  The first showing is, in most cases, easily made; the second and third are more likely to generate controversy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendant in <em>Duren </em>readily met all three measures.  He complained of the dearth of women in the Jackson County, Missouri, jury pool.  To establish underrepresentation, he proved that women were 54% of the jury-eligible population, but accounted for only 26.7% of the persons summoned for jury service, and only 14.5% of the persons on the postsummons weekly venires from which jurors were drawn.  To show the \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the underrepresentation, Duren pointed to Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s law exempting women from jury service, and to the manner in which Jackson County administered the exemption.  Concluding that no significant state interest could justify Missouri\xe2\x80\x99s explicitly gender-based exemption, this Court held the law, as implemented in Jackson County, violative of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s fair-cross-section requirement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We here review the decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit holding that Smith \xe2\x80\x9csatisf[ied] the prima facie test established by <em>Duren</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>and granting him habeas corpus relief, <em>i.e.,</em> release from imprisonment absent a new trial commenced within 180 days of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 order.  543 F. 3d 326, 336 (2008).  Despite marked differences between Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case and Duren\xe2\x80\x99s, and a cogent Michigan Supreme Court decision holding that Smith \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not shown \xe2\x80\xa6 systematic exclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>People </em>v. <em>Smith</em>, 463 Mich. 199, 205, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 1, 3 (2000), the Sixth Circuit found the matter settled.  Cognizant of the restrictions Congress placed on federal habeas review of state-court convictions, the Court of Appeals considered that a decision contrary to its own would \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] an unreasonable application o[f] clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  543 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit erred in so ruling.  No decision of this Court \xe2\x80\x9cclearly establishe[s]\xe2\x80\x9d Smith\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to federal-court relief.  According to the Sixth Circuit, Smith had demonstrated that a Kent County prospective-juror-assignment procedure, which Smith calls \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csystematic[ally] exclu[ded]\xe2\x80\x9d African-Americans.  Under this procedure, Kent County assigned prospective jurors first to local district courts, and, only after filling local needs, made remaining persons available to the countywide Circuit Court, which heard felony cases like Smith\xe2\x80\x99s.  The Michigan Supreme Court, however, had rejected Smith\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning\xe2\x80\x9d plea for lack of proof that the assignment procedure caused underrepresentation.  <em>Smith</em>, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 3.  As that determination was not at all unreasonable, the Sixth Circuit had no warrant to disturb it.  See \xc2\xa72254(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to renewal of his \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning\xe2\x80\x9d argument, Smith here urges that a host of factors combined to reduce systematically the number of African-Americans appearing on Kent County jury lists, for example, the Kent County court\xe2\x80\x99s practice of excusing people without adequate proof of alleged hardship, and the refusal of Kent County police to enforce orders for prospective jurors to appear.  Brief for Respondent 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  Our decisions do not address factors of the kind Smith urges.  We have cautioned, however, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he fair-cross-section principle must have much leeway in application.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, 419 U. S., at 537\xe2\x80\x93538; see <em>id.,</em> at 537 (Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Sixth Amendment is violated by systematic exclusion of women from jury service \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not augur or authorize the fashioning of detailed jury-selection codes by federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On November 7, 1991, Christopher Rumbley was shot and killed during a bar brawl in Grand Rapids, Michigan.  The bar was crowded at the time of the brawl, with 200-to-300 people on the premises.  All patrons of the bar were African-American.  The State charged Smith with the murder in Kent County Circuit Court.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Voir dire</em> for Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial took place in September 1993.  The venire panel included between 60 and 100 individuals.  The parties agree that, at most, three venire members were African-American.  Smith unsuccessfully objected to the composition of the venire panel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case proceeded to trial before an all-white jury.  The case for the prosecution turned on the identity of the man who shot Rumbley.  Thirty-seven witnesses from the bar, including Smith, testified at the trial.  Of those, two testified that Smith fired the gun.  Five testified that the shooter was not Smith, and the remainder made no identifications of the shooter.  The jury convicted Smith of second-degree murder and possession of a firearm during a felony, and the court sentenced him to life imprisonment with the possibility of parole.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On first appeal, the Michigan Court of Appeals ordered the trial court to conduct an evidentiary hearing on Smith\xe2\x80\x99s fair-cross-section claim.  The hearing occurred in early 1998.  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence showed that Grand Rapids, the largest city in Kent County, was home to roughly 37% of Kent County\xe2\x80\x99s population, and to 85% of its African-American residents.  Felony charges in Kent County were tried in a sole Circuit Court.  Misdemeanors were prosecuted in 12 district courts, each covering a discrete geographical area.  To fill the courts\xe2\x80\x99 venires, Kent County sent questionnaires to prospective jurors.  The Circuit Court Administrator testified that about 5% of the forms were returned as undeliverable, and another 15 to 20% were not answered.  App. 13a.  From the pool of prospective jurors who completed questionnaires, the County granted requests for hardship exemptions, <em>e.g., </em>for lack of transportation or child care.  <em>Id.,</em> at 21a.  Kent County then assigned nonexempt prospective jurors to their local district courts\xe2\x80\x99 venires.  After filling the district courts\xe2\x80\x99 needs, the County assigned the remaining prospective jurors to the Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x99s panels.  <em>Id.,</em> at 20a, 22a.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The month after <em>voir dire</em> for Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial, Kent County reversed the assignment order.  It did so, according to the Circuit Court Administrator, based on \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he belief \xe2\x80\xa6 that the respective districts essentially swallowed up most of the minority jurors,\xe2\x80\x9d leaving the Circuit Court with a jury pool that \xe2\x80\x9cdid not represent the entire county.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 22a.  The Jury Minority Representation Committee, its co-chair testified, held the same view concerning the impact of choosing district court jurors first and not returning unused persons to the pool available for Circuit Court selections.  <em>Id.,</em> at 64a\xe2\x80\x9365a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial court considered two means of measuring the extent of underrepresentation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires: \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute disparity\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomparative disparity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cAbsolute disparity\xe2\x80\x9d is determined by subtracting the percentage of African-Americans in the jury pool (here, 6% in the six months leading up to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial) from the percentage of African-Americans in the local, jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%).  By an absolute disparity measure, therefore, African-Americans were underrepresented by 1.28%.  \xe2\x80\x9cComparative disparity\xe2\x80\x9d is determined by dividing the absolute disparity (here, 1.28%) by the group\xe2\x80\x99s representation in the jury-eligible population (here, 7.28%).  The quotient (here, 18%), showed that, in the six months prior to Smith\xe2\x80\x99s trial, African-Americans were, on average, 18% less likely, when compared to the overall jury-eligible population, to be on the jury-service list.

In the 11 months after Kent County discontinued the district-court-first assignment policy, the comparative disparity, on average, dropped from 18% to 15.1%.  <em>Id.,</em> at 102a\xe2\x80\x93103a, 113a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Smith also introduced the testimony of an expert in demographics and economics, who tied the underrepresentation to social and economic factors.  In Kent County, the expert explained, these forces made African-Americans less likely than whites to receive or return juror-eligibility questionnaires, and more likely to assert a hardship excuse.  <em>Id.,</em> at 79a\xe2\x80\x9380a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The hearing convinced the trial court that African-Americans were underrepresented in Circuit Court venires.

But Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence was insufficient, that court held, to prove that the juror-assignment order, or any other part of the jury-selection process, had systematically excluded African-Americans.  <em>Id.,</em> at 210a\xe2\x80\x93212a.

Reversing the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, the intermediate appellate court ordered a new trial, with jurors selected under the Circuit-Court-first assignment order installed shortly after the <em>voir dire </em>in Smith\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see <em>supra,</em> at 5.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Michigan Supreme Court, in turn, reversed the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment, concluding that Smith \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not established a prima facie violation of the Sixth Amendment fair-cross-section requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith</em>, 463 Mich., at 207, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 4.

S., at 360.  The Court explained why it was plain that defendant Duren had established a prima facie case.  First, women in Jackson County were both \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous and distinct from men.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 364 (quoting <em>Taylor</em>, 419 U. S., at 531).  Second, Duren\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstatistical presentation\xe2\x80\x9d showed gross underrepresentation: Women were over half the jury-eligible population; in stark contrast, they accounted for less than 15% of jury venires.  439 U. S.<em>,</em> at 364\xe2\x80\x93366.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Duren also demonstrated systematic exclusion with particularity.  He proved that women\xe2\x80\x99s underrepresentation was persistent\xe2\x80\x94occurring in every weekly venire for almost a year\xe2\x80\x94and he identified the two stages of the jury-selection process \xe2\x80\x9cwhen \xe2\x80\xa6 the systematic exclusion took place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 366.  First, questionnaires for prospective jurors stated conspicuously that women could opt out of jury service.  Less than 30% of those summoned were female, suggesting that women in large numbers claimed the exemption at the questionnaire stage.  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover, at the summons stage women were \xe2\x80\xa6 given another opportunity to [opt out].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 366\xe2\x80\x93367.  And if a woman ignored the summons, she was deemed to have opted out; no further inquiry was made.  <em>Id.,</em> at 367. <em> </em>At this \xe2\x80\x9cfinal, venire, stage,\xe2\x80\x9d women\xe2\x80\x99s representation plummeted to 14.5%.  <em>Ibid.  </em>In the Federal District Court serving the same territory, the Court noted, despite a women-only childcare exemption, women accounted for nearly 40% of those actually serving on juries.

Brief for Respondent 46\xe2\x80\x9348.  But as the Michigan Supreme Court not at all unreasonably concluded, <em>Smith</em>,<em> </em>463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 3, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence scarcely shows that the assignment order he targets caused underrepresentation.  Although the record established that some officials and others in Kent County <em>believed </em>that the assignment order created racial disparities, and the County reversed the order in response, <em>supra,</em> at 5, the belief was not substantiated by Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evidence that African-Americans were underrepresented on the Circuit Court\xe2\x80\x99s venires in significantly higher percentages than on the Grand Rapids District Court\xe2\x80\x99s could have indicated that the assignment order made a critical difference.  But, as the Michigan Supreme Court noted, Smith adduced no evidence to that effect.  See <em>Smith</em>,<em> </em>463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 3.  Nor did Smith address whether Grand Rapids, which had the County\xe2\x80\x99s largest African-American population, \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] more need for jurors per capita than [any other district in Kent County].\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 26; <em>id.,</em> at 18, 37.  Furthermore, Smith did not endeavor to compare the African-American representation levels in Circuit Court venires with those in the Federal District Court venires for the same region.  See <em>id.,</em> at 46\xe2\x80\x9347; <em>Duren</em>, 439 U.

See <em>supra,</em> at 5.  This evidence\xe2\x80\x94particularly in view of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s instruction, \xc2\xa72254(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x94is insufficient to support Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the assignment order caused the underrepresentation.  As Smith\xe2\x80\x99s counsel recognized at oral argument, this decrease could not fairly be described as \xe2\x80\x9ca big change.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 51; see <em>ibid.</em> (the drop was \xe2\x80\x9ca step in the right direction\xe2\x80\x9d).  In short, Smith\xe2\x80\x99s evidence gave the Michigan Supreme Court little reason to conclude that the district-court-first assignment order had a significantly adverse impact on the representation of African-Americans on Circuit Court venires.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To establish systematic exclusion, Smith contends, the defendant must show only that the underrepresentation is persistent and \xe2\x80\x9cproduced by the method or \xe2\x80\x98system\xe2\x80\x99 used to select [jurors],\xe2\x80\x9d rather than by chance.  Brief for Respondent 38, 40.  In this regard, Smith catalogs a laundry list of factors in addition to the alleged \xe2\x80\x9csiphoning\xe2\x80\x9d that, he urges, rank as \xe2\x80\x9csystematic\xe2\x80\x9d causes of underrepresentation of African-Americans in Kent County\xe2\x80\x99s jury pool.  <em>Id.,</em> at 53\xe2\x80\x9354.  Smith\xe2\x80\x99s list includes the County\xe2\x80\x99s practice of excusing people who merely alleged hardship or simply failed to show up for jury service, its reliance on mail notices, its failure to follow up on nonresponses, its use of residential addresses at least 15 months old, and the refusal of Kent County police to enforce court orders for the appearance of prospective jurors.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0No \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d precedent of this Court supports Smith\xe2\x80\x99s claim that he can make out a prima facie case merely by pointing to a host of factors that, individually or in combination, might </em>contribute<em> </em>to a group\xe2\x80\x99s underrepresentation.  Smith recites a sentence in our <em>Duren</em> opinion that, he says, placed the burden of proving causation on the State.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 33, 35.  The sentence reads: \xe2\x80\x9cAssuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that the exemptions mentioned by the court below [those for persons over 65, teachers, and government workers] would justify failure to achieve a fair community cross section on jury venires, the State must demonstrate that these exemptions [rather than the women\xe2\x80\x99s exemption] caused the underrepresentation complained of.\xe2\x80\x9d  439 U. S., at 368\xe2\x80\x93369.  That sentence appears after the Court had already assigned to Duren\xe2\x80\x94and found he had carried\xe2\x80\x94the burden of proving that the underrepresentation \xe2\x80\x9cwas due to [women\xe2\x80\x99s] systematic exclusion in the jury-selection process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 366.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s comment, which Smith clipped from its context, does not concern the demonstration of a prima face case.  Instead, it addresses what the State might show <em>to rebut</em> the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prima facie case.  The Michigan Supreme Court was therefore far from \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), in concluding that <em>Duren </em>first and foremost required Smith himself to show that the underrepresentation complained of was \xe2\x80\x9cdue to systematic exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 364; see <em>Smith</em>, 463 Mich., at 205, 615 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 3.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court, furthermore, has never \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d that jury-selection-process features of the kind on Smith\xe2\x80\x99s list can give rise to a fair-cross-section claim.
