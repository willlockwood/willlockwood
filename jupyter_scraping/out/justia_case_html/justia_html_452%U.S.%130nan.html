S. 132</a></p><p> Federal District Court by the legislative body of a covered jurisdiction [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] in response to a judicial determination that the existing apportionment of its electoral districts is unconstitutional.  Relying on <em>East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/636/case.html">424 U. S. 636</a></span> (per curiam), the District Court held </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 452 U. S. 133</a></p><p> that the plan submitted to it in this case was a judicial plan, and thus excepted from the requirements of \xc2\xa7 5.  Relying on <em>Wise v. Lipscomb,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html">437 U. S. 535</a></span>, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed; it held that, because the plan had been prepared by a legislative body, it was a legislative plan within the coverage of \xc2\xa7 5.  We are persuaded that Congress intended to require compliance with the statutory preclearance procedures under the circumstances of this case.  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p>The covered jurisdiction in this case is Kleberg County, a rural county in Texas.  Under Texas law, a Commissioners Court, which is composed of four county commissioners presided over by the county judge, is authorized to govern Kleberg County.  The county is divided periodically by the Commissioners Court into four commissioners\' precincts, each of which elects a resident to the position of county commissioner.  The county judge is elected at large.  The county commissioners and the county judge serve 4-year terms. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>In January, 1978, four Mexican-American residents of Kleberg County brought this class action against various county officials alleging that the apportionment of the four commissioners\' precincts denied individual residents of the larger precincts a vote of equal weight, and unconstitutionally diluted the voting strength of the county\'s substantial Mexican-American population. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  After a trial, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the District Court rejected </p><p><a class="page-number" name="134">Page 452 U. S. 134</a></p><p> the plaintiffs\' claim that the county\'s apportionment plan unconstitutionally diluted the voting power of Mexican-Americans as a class, but held that individual voters were denied equal representation because of the substantial disparity in the number of residents in each commissioners\' precinct. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The District Court therefore directed the county officials to submit a proposed reapportionment plan to the court within six weeks, and scheduled a hearing on the validity of the proposal for four weeks thereafter. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the District Court\'s order, the Commissioners Court undertook the task of devising a new apportionment plan.  The Commissioners Court employed Dr. Robert Nash, a statistician and the Dean of the College of Business at Texas A. &amp; I. University, to prepare a new plan, instructing him to define the commissioners\' precincts "on a one-person/one-vote basis." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  With one insignificant modification, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="135">Page 452 U. S. 135</a></p><p> the Commissioners Court officially adopted the plan prepared by Dr. Nash as the plan it would submit to the District Court.</p>\n<p>Respondents objected to the proposed plan.  They challenged the data used by the Dean, they claimed that the plan diluted the voting strength of Mexican-Americans, and they contended that the Voting Rights Act required the county to obtain preclearance from the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before the plan could become effective. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  After an evidentiary hearing, the District Court rejected both of respondents\' factual contentions, and held as a matter of law that the Voting Rights Act did not require preclearance.  The court entered an order approving the new plan and authorizing the Commissioners Court to conduct the 1980 primary and general elections under it.  <em>See</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. A-21 to A-23.</p>\n<p>Without expressing any opinion with respect to the constitutionality of the new plan, the Court of Appeals vacated </p><p><a class="page-number" name="136">Page 452 U. S. 136</a></p><p> the District Court\'s order in a per curiam opinion.  <em>See</em> 615 F.2d 1023 (1980).  Reasoning that</p>\n<p>"[a] proposed reapportionment plan submitted by a local legislative body does not lose its status as a legislative, rather than court-ordered, plan merely because it is the product of litigation conducted in a federal forum,"</p>\n<p><em>id.</em> at 1024, the Court of Appeals held that the Voting Rights Act required preclearance.  The court thereafter denied petitioners\' application for a stay pending filing and consideration of a petition for writ of certiorari.  On August 14, 1980, however, JUSTICE POWELL, in his capacity as Circuit Justice, entered an order recalling the mandate and staying the judgment of the Court of Appeals pending disposition of the petition for certiorari.   <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/1318/case.html">448 U. S. 448</a></span> U.S. 1318.  We granted that petition because the question presented is important and because the answer suggested by our prior opinions is not free of ambiguity.  449 U.S. 898. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>In this Court, the county officials contend that the Voting Rights Act does not apply to a plan that</p>\n<p>"(a) was prepared and presented in response to an order by the district court, (b) was not prepared by county officials, but by a third party expert, (c) was not adopted by the county before submission to the court, (d) was considered by the trial court to be court-ordered, and (e) was put into effect only after county officials were ordered to do so by the trial court. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]"</p>\n<p>We first consider the significance of the distinction between legislative and court-ordered plans as identified in our prior cases.  We then review our decisions in <em>East Carroll</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="137">Page 452 U. S. 137</a></p><p> and <em>Wise v. Lipscomb,</em> on which the District Court and the Court of Appeals respectively placed primary reliance.  Finally, we examine the statute and its legislative history.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Texas and its political subdivisions are covered by the Voting Rights Act.  <em>Briscoe v. Bell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/404/case.html">432 U. S. 404</a></span>. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Section 5 of that Act is applicable whenever a covered jurisdiction</p>\n<p>"shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1972. . . ."</p>\n<p>42 U.S.C.1973c.  A reapportionment plan is a "standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 5, <em>Georgia v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html">411 U. S. 526</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/526/case.html#531">411 U. S. 531</a></span>-535, and it is undisputed that Kleberg County is a covered jurisdiction.  What is in dispute is whether that jurisdiction did "enact or seek to administer" a proposed reapportionment plan when it presented that plan to a Federal District Court as a proposed remedy for a constitutional violation.  If the statute does apply, then the plan must be precleared either by the Attorney General of the United States or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia before it may become effective. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  In such a preclearance proceeding, it is not sufficient to demonstrate that the new plan is constitutional; the covered jurisdiction also has the burden of demonstrating that the districting changes are not motivated by a discriminatory purpose and will not have an adverse impact on minority voters.  <em>See, e.g., City of Rome v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/case.html">446 U. S. 156</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/156/case.html#172">446 U. S. 172</a></span>-173. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="138">Page 452 U. S. 138</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Two polar propositions are perfectly clear.  First, the Act requires preclearance of new legislative apportionment plans that are adopted without judicial direction or approval.  <em>See Georgia v. United States, supra.</em>  Second, the Act\'s preclearance requirement does not apply to plans prepared and adopted by a federal court to remedy a constitutional violation.  <em>See Connor v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/690/case.html">402 U. S. 690</a></span> (per curiam). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Petitioners contend that the Act does not apply to this reapportionment plan because it is a court-ordered plan, while respondents argue that the Act does apply because the plan was prepared and submitted on behalf of the local legislative body.</p>\n<p>In prior reapportionment cases not arising under the Voting Rights Act, we have recognized important differences between legislative plans and court-ordered plans.  Because "reapportionment is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State through its legislature or other body, rather than of a federal court," <em>Chapman v. Meer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/1/case.html">420 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/1/case.html#27">420 U. S. 27</a></span>, the Court has tolerated somewhat greater flexibility in the fashioning of legislative remedies for violation of the one-person, one-vote rule than when a federal court prepares its own </p><p><a class="page-number" name="139">Page 452 U. S. 139</a></p><p> remedial decree.  Thus, in <em>Chapman,</em> we held that,</p>\n<p>"unless there are persuasive justifications, a court-ordered reapportionment plan of a state legislature must avoid use of multimember districts, and, as well, must ordinarily achieve the goal of population equality with little more than <em>de minimis</em> variation."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/1/case.html#26">420 U. S. 26</a></span>-27 (footnote omitted). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In contrast, reapportionment plans prepared by legislative bodies may employ multimember districts and may result in greater population disparities than would be permitted in a court-ordered plan.  <em>See Connor v. Finch,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/407/case.html">431 U. S. 407</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/407/case.html#414">431 U. S. 414</a></span>-415.  <em>Cf. Mahan v. Howell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/315/case.html">410 U. S. 315</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In this case, we are concerned only with the question whether the reapportionment plan submitted to the District Court should be considered a legislative plan for purposes of preclearance under \xc2\xa7 5.  We are not presented with any question concerning the substantive acceptability of that plan.  Nonetheless, we draw significant guidance from prior cases in which the substantive acceptability of a reapportionment plan, rather than the applicability of \xc2\xa7 5, was at issue.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In neither of the cases on which the respective parties now place their primary reliance did the Court predicate its decision on the Voting Rights Act.  In both of those cases, the question before the Court was whether it was error for the District Court to approve the inclusion of a multimember district in the reapportionment plan under review.</p>\n<p>In <em>East Carroll Parish School Board v. Marshall,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/636/case.html">424 U. S. 636</a></span> (per curiam), the plaintiff contended that population disparities among the parish\'s wards had unconstitutionally denied him the right to cast an effective vote for representatives to the school board and the police jury, the governing body of the parish.  The District Court found that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="140">Page 452 U. S. 140</a></p><p> parish\'s existing apportionment was unconstitutional.  As a remedy, the court adopted a reapportionment plan, suggested by the police jury, that provided for at-large election of the members of both the police jury and the school board.  Following the 1970 census, the District Court directed the police jury and school board to submit revised reapportionment plans.  They resubmitted the plan calling for at-large elections, and the District Court again approved this plan.  After a divided panel of the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s decision, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] the court, sitting en banc, reversed on the ground that the multimember arrangement approved by the District Court was unconstitutional. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>When we reviewed the case, we concluded that it was improper for the Court of Appeals to base its decision on a constitutional ground in view of the fact that the District Court had violated the frequently reaffirmed</p>\n<p>"rule that, when United States district courts are put to the task of fashioning reapportionment plans to supplant concededly invalid state legislation, single-member districts are to be preferred absent unusual circumstances."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/636/case.html#639">424 U. S. 639</a></span>.  Thus, we held in <em>East Carroll</em> that the plan approved by the District Court was a judicial plan for purposes of substantive review.</p>\n<p>Although the issue was not raised by the parties, we also stated in <em>East Carroll</em> that the plan was a judicial plan for purposes of \xc2\xa7 5 preclearance.  Neither of the parties had argued that \xc2\xa7 5\'s preclearance requirement was applicable in that case.  However, the United States, as <em>amicus curiae,</em> had contended that, because the plan had been submitted by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 452 U. S. 141</a></p><p> legislative bodies of a covered jurisdiction, preclearance was required.  We rejected that argument in a footnote:</p>\n<p>"[C]ourt-ordered plans resulting from equitable jurisdiction over adversary proceedings are not controlled by \xc2\xa7 5.  Had the East Carroll police jury reapportioned itself on its own authority, clearance under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act would clearly have been required.  <em>Connor v. Waller,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/421/656/case.html">421 U. S. 656</a></span> (1975).  However, in submitting the plan to the District Court, the jury did not purport to reapportion itself in accordance with the 1968 enabling legislation . . . which permitted police juries and school boards to adopt at-large elections.  App. 56.  Moreover, since the Louisiana enabling legislation was opposed by the Attorney General of the United States under \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the jury did not have the authority to reapportion itself. . . .  Since the reapportionment scheme was submitted and adopted pursuant to court order, the preclearance procedures of \xc2\xa7 5 do not apply.  <em>Connor v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/402/690/case.html">402 U. S. 690</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/402/690/case.html#691">402 U.

Petitioners rely heavily upon this footnote.  While their reliance is understandable, the footnote is not dispositive in this case.  The discussion of \xc2\xa7 5 in <em>East Carroll</em> was dictum unnecessary to the decision in that case.  It is, therefore, not controlling in this case, in which the impact of \xc2\xa7 5 is directly placed in issue. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  Moreover, our subsequent decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html">Wise</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 452 U.

S. 535</a></span>, indicates that, at least to the extent that <em>East Carroll</em> addressed the Voting Rights Act, it must be narrowly limited to its particular facts.</p>\n<p>In <em>Wise v. Lipscomb,</em> the District Court held that the system of at-large election to the Dallas City Council unconstitutionally diluted the voting strength of black citizens.  The court thereafter gave the City Council an opportunity to prepare and submit a new apportionment plan.  In response, the City Council passed a resolution stating the Council\'s intention to pass an ordinance providing for the election of eight council members from single-member districts, and for the election of the three remaining members from the city at large.  The District Court conducted a hearing "<em>to determine the constitutionality of the new proposed plan\'" and held that it was "a valid legislative Act."  <em>See</em> 437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#538">437 U. S. 538</a></span>-539.  The Court of Appeals reversed, relying on <em>East Carroll</em> to hold that it was error for the District Court merely to evaluate the new plan under constitutional standards without also deciding whether exceptional circumstances justified the inclusion of a multimember district in that judicially imposed reapportionment plan.  <em>See</em> 551 F.2d 1043 (CA5 1977).\n</em></p>\n<p>The question this Court addressed was whether the District Court had committed error by failing to apply the usual presumption against multimember districts in judicial reapportionment plans.  In his opinion announcing the judgment of the Court, JUSTICE WHITE, joined by JUSTICE STEWART, answered that question by holding that the presumption did not apply, because it is</p>\n<p>"appropriate, whenever practicable, to afford a reasonable opportunity for the legislature to meet constitutional requirements by adopting a substitute measure, rather than for the federal court to devise and order into effect its own plan."</p>\n<p>437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#540">437 U.

JUSTICE WHITE distinguished <em>East Carroll</em> on the ground that the legislative bodies in that case had not purported to reapportion themselves and, indeed, had been without power to reapportion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 452 U.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The Dallas City Council, in contrast, had acted within its inherent legislative authority in devising and submitting a reapportionment plan to replace the plan invalidated by the District Court in <em>Wise.</em> <em>See</em> 437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#545">437 U.

JUSTICE POWELL agreed with JUSTICE WHITE\'s conclusion that the Dallas reapportionment plan was a legislative plan for purposes of the application of the presumption against multimember districts.  However, relying upon <em>Burns v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/73/case.html">384 U. S. 73</a></span>, JUSTICE POWELL disagreed with JUSTICE WHITE\'s suggestion that <em>East Carroll</em> had held that a proposed reapportionment plan may be considered legislative only if the legislative body that suggested the plan had authority to enact it under state law.  437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#548">437 U.

He explained that the critical difference between a legislative plan and a court-imposed plan for purposes of substantive review was that the former reflected the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people, whereas the latter represented the remedial directive of a federal court. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  Deference to the judgment of the legislative body was required even if that body lacked authority under state law to adopt the proposed reapportionment plan. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In dissent, JUSTICE MARSHALL, joined by JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE STEVENS, expressed the opinion that <em>Wise</em> was indistinguishable from <em>East Carroll,</em> and that the Court of Appeals therefore had correctly applied the presumption </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 452 U. S. 145</a></p><p> against multimember districts.  437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#550">437 U. S. 550</a></span>-554.  JUSTICE MARSHALL, however, agreed with the majority that it would not be proper to reach any question under the Voting Rights Act, because Texas had not been subject to the Act when the case was pending in the District Court. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>While it is clear that <em>Wise,</em> like <em>East Carroll,</em> did not require the Court to decide any statutory issue, the references to \xc2\xa7 5 of the Voting Rights Act in JUSTICE WHITE\'s opinion announcing the judgment of the Court are nevertheless instructive.  After pointing out that "the distinctive impact" of \xc2\xa7 5 upon the power of the States to reapportion themselves must be observed in the normal case, 437 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#541">437 U. S. 541</a></span>-542, JUSTICE WHITE stated:</p>\n<p>"Plans imposed by court order are not subject to the requirements of \xc2\xa7 5, but, under that provision, a State or political subdivision subject to the Act may not \'enact or seek to administer\' any \'different\' voting qualification or procedure with respect to voting without either obtaining a declaratory judgment from the United States District Court for the District of Columbia that the proposed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 452 U. S. 146</a></p><p> change \'does not have the purpose, and will not have the effect, of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color\' or submitting the change to the Attorney General and affording him an appropriate opportunity to object thereto.  A new reapportionment plan enacted by a State, including one purportedly adopted in response to invalidation of the prior plan by a federal court, will not be considered \'effective as law,\' <em>Connor v. Finch,</em> 431 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/431/407/case.html#412">431 U. S. 412</a></span>; <em>Connor v.

Neither, in those circumstances, until clearance has been obtained, should a court address the constitutionality of the new measure.  <em>Connor v. Finch, supra; Connor v. Waller, supra.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html#542">437 U. S. 542</a></span> (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>Neither <em>East Carroll</em> nor <em>Wise</em> decided the precise question that is now presented.  Nonetheless, both JUSTICE WHITE\'s opinion and JUSTICE POWELL\'s opinion surely foreshadowed the holding we announce today.  For both opinions indicate that the fact that the reapportionment plan before us was devised in response to an order of a federal court does not change its character as a legislative plan.  In addition, JUSTICE POWELL\'s opinion indicates that the Commissioners Court\'s power under Texas law to adopt this plan should be irrelevant to the decision in this case.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>This is not a case in which the language of the controlling statute unambiguously answers the question presented.  The Solicitor General, on behalf of the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> contends that a covered jurisdiction "seek[s] to administer" a new voting practice when it submits a redistricting plan to a district court as a proposed remedy for a constitutional violation.  This is a plausible, but not an obviously correct, reading of the statutory language.  For there is force to the contrary argument that Kleberg County had no intention </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 452 U. S. 147</a></p><p> to administer any new plan until after it was given legal effect by incorporation in a judicial decree.  Arguably, therefore, the statute has no application before the District Court enters its decree, and because the Act does not require the District Court to have its decisions precleared, <em>see Connor v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/690/case.html">402 U. S. 690</a></span>, once such a decree is entered, it is too late for the statute to qualify the county\'s duty to administer the plan as entered by the District Court.  We find sufficient ambiguity in the statutory language to make it appropriate to turn to legislative history for guidance.</p>\n<p>In 1975, when Congress adopted the amendments that ultimately brought Texas and Kleberg County within the coverage of the Act, it directed special attention to \xc2\xa7 5 and to the redistricting that would be required after the 1980 census. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  In its Report on S. 1279, the bill that extended the life of the Voting Rights Act beyond 1975, the Senate Committee on the Judiciary explained "the future need for the Act" by pointing out that redrafting of district lines to correct violations of the one-person, one-vote rule created opportunities to disenfranchise minority voters. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>"By providing that Section </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 452 U. S. 148</a></p><p> 5 protections not be removed before 1985, S. 1279 would guarantee Federal protection of minority voting rights during the years that the post-census redistrictings will take place. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Committee unambiguously stated that the statutory protections are to be available even when the redistricting is ordered by a federal court to remedy a constitutional violation that has been established in pending federal litigation.  The Committee Report is crystal clear on this point:</p>\n<p>"Thus, for example, where a federal district court holds unconstitutional an apportionment plan which predates the effective date of coverage under the Voting Rights Act, any subsequent plan ordinarily would be subject to Section 5 review.  In the typical case, the court either will direct the governmental body to adopt a new plan and present it to the court for consideration or else itself choose a plan from among those presented by various parties to the litigation.  In either situation, the court should defer its consideration of -- or selection among -- any plans presented to it until such time as these plans have been submitted for Section 5 review.  Only after such review should the district court proceed to any remaining fourteenth or fifteenth amendment questions that may be raised."</p>\n<p>"The one exception where Section 5 review would not ordinarily be available is where the court, because of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 452 U. S. 149</a></p><p> exigent circumstances, actually fashions the plan itself, instead of relying on a plan presented by a litigant.  This is the limited meaning of the \'court decree\' exception recognized in <em>Connor v. Johnson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/402/690/case.html">402 U. S. 690</a></span> (1971).  Even in these cases, however, if the governmental body subsequently adopts a plan patterned after the court\'s plan, Section 5 review would be required, <em>Connor v. Waller, supra.</em>  Furthermore, in fashioning the plan, the court should follow the appropriate Section 5 standards, including the body of administrative and judicial precedents developed in Section 5 cases."</p>\n<p>Senate Report at 18-19. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>The view expressed by the Committee is consistent with the basic purposes of the statute and with the well-settled rule that \xc2\xa7 5 is to be given a broad construction.  <em>See, e.g., Dougherty County Board of Education v. White,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/32/case.html">439 U. S. 32</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/32/case.html#38">439 U. S. 38</a></span>; <em>United States v. Sheffield Board of Commissioners,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/case.html">435 U. S. 110</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/110/case.html#122">435 U. S. 122</a></span>-123; <em>Perkins v.

S. 379</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/400/379/case.html#387">400 U. S. 387</a></span>.  The preclearance procedure is designed to forestall the danger that local decisions to modify voting practices will impair minority access to the electoral process. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The federal interest in preventing local jurisdictions from making changes that adversely affect the rights of minority voters is the same whether a change is required to remedy a constitutional violation or is merely the product of a community\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 452 U. S. 150</a></p><p> perception of the desirability of responding to new social patterns. [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>]</p>\n<p>It is true, of course, that the federal interest may be protected by the federal district court presiding over voting right litigation, but sound reasons support the Committee\'s view that the normal \xc2\xa7 5 preclearance procedures should nevertheless be followed in cases such as this. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  The procedures </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 452 U. S. 151</a></p><p> contemplated by the statute reflect a congressional choice in favor of specialized review either by the Attorney General of the United States or by the United States District Court for the District of Columbia.  Because a large number of voting changes must necessarily undergo the preclearance process, centralized review enhances the likelihood that recurring problems will be resolved in a consistent and expeditious way. [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Moreover, if covered jurisdictions could avoid the normal preclearance procedure by awaiting litigation challenging a refusal to redistrict after a census is completed, the statute might have the unintended effect of actually encouraging delay in making obviously needed changes in district boundaries.  The federal interest in evenhanded review of all changes in covered jurisdictions is furthered by the application of the statute in cases such as this.</p>\n<p>The application of the statute is not dependent on a showing that the county\'s proposed plan is defective in any way.  <em>Cf. United States v. Board of Supervisors of Warren County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/642/case.html">429 U. S. 642</a></span> (per curiam); <em>Morris v. Gressette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/case.html">432 U. S. 491</a></span>.  The prophylactic purposes of the \xc2\xa7 5 remedy are achieved by automatically requiring "review of <em>all</em> voting changes prior to implementation by the covered jurisdictions."  Senate Report at 15 (emphasis supplied). [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  It is therefore not material that the plan submitted by the Commissioners </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 452 U. S. 152</a></p><p> Court of Kleberg County in this case was actually prepared by an independent expert.  His expertise may facilitate the satisfactory completion of the preclearance process, but it does not obviate the preclearance requirement itself.  For just as the reasons for the county\'s decision to propose a new plan are irrelevant to the statutory preclearance requirement, so also is the particular method that is employed in formulating the plan that is submitted to the court on behalf of the county irrelevant.</p>\n<p>The application of the statute also is not dependent upon any showing that the Commissioners Court had authority under state law to enact the apportionment plan at issue in this case. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  As JUSTICE POWELL pointed out in <em>Wise v. Lipscomb,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/case.html">437 U. S. 535</a></span>, the essential characteristic of a legislative plan is the exercise of legislative judgment.  The fact that particular requirements of state law may not be satisfied before a plan is proposed to a federal court does not alter this essential characteristic.  The applicability of \xc2\xa7 5 to specific </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 452 U. S. 153</a></p><p> remedial plans is a matter of federal law that federal courts should determine pursuant to a uniform federal rule.</p>\n<p>As we construe the congressional mandate, it requires that whenever a covered jurisdiction submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected representatives of the people -- no matter what constraints have limited the choices available to them -- the preclearance requirement of the Voting Rights Act is applicable. [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>]  It was therefore error for the District Court to act on the county\'s proposed plan before it had been submitted to the Attorney General or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for preclearance.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Voting Rights Act was enacted in 1965, 79 Stat. 437, and was amended in 1970, 84 Stat. 314, and in 1975, 89 Stat. 400.  In relevant part, \xc2\xa7 5, 89 Stat. 404, as set forth in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973c, now provides:</p>\n<p>"[W]henever a State or political subdivision with respect to which the prohibitions set forth in section 1973b(a) of this title based upon determinations made under the third sentence of section 1973b(b) of this title are in effect shall enact or seek to administer any voting qualification or prerequisite to voting, or standard, practice, or procedure with respect to voting different from that in force or effect on November 1, 1972, such State or subdivision may institute an action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for a declaratory judgment that such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure does not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, and unless and until the court enters such judgment no person shall be denied the right to vote for failure to comply with such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure:  <em>Provided,</em> That such qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure may be enforced without such proceeding if the qualification, prerequisite, standard, practice, or procedure has been submitted by the chief legal officer or other appropriate official of such State or subdivision to the Attorney General and the Attorney General has not interposed an objection within sixty days after such submission, or upon good cause shown, to facilitate an expedited approval within sixty days after such submission, the Attorney General has affirmatively indicated that such objection will not be made."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 4 of the Act identifies the jurisdictions that are subject to the Act\'s prohibitions.  One of the determinants of coverage is the use of a "test or device" as a prerequisite for registration or voting.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1973b(b), (c).  In 1975, Congress enlarged the coverage of the Act by changing the definition of "test or device" to protect non-English-speaking citizens who constitute more than 5% of the voting age population in any jurisdiction. The amendment provides:</p>\n<p>"In addition to the meaning given the term under subsection (c) of this section, the term \'test or device\' shall also mean any practice or requirement by which any State or political subdivision provided any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, only in the English language, where the Director of the Census determines that more than five per centum of the citizens of voting age residing in such State or political subdivision are members of a single language minority."</p>\n<p>89 Stat. 401-402, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1973b(f)(3).  As a result of this amendment, Texas and its political subdivisions became covered jurisdictions.  <em>See Briscoe v.

After the primary election, the Court of Appeals vacated the District Court\'s order denying a preliminary injunction and remanded for reconsideration in the light of its decision in <em>Lister v. Commissioners Court,</em> 566 F.2d 490 (1978), which held that a Commissioners Court "had a clear duty to reapportion on the basis of the 1970 Census."  <em>Id.</em> at 492.

If the precinct boundaries had been drawn to achieve perfect population equality, each precinct would have had 8,291 residents.

The maximum deviation from the largest precinct to the smallest was therefore 38.9%.  <em>See</em> App. to Pet. for Cert. A-5.

When the county was unable to obtain the Attorney General\'s approval for either of two proposed plans, it submitted the plans to the District Court.  The court adopted one of the plans despite the county\'s failure to obtain the Attorney General\'s approval, finding that the plan neither diluted minority voting strength nor violated the one-person, one-vote principle.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/642/case.html#643">429 U.

The plan in this case was submitted to the District Court in November, and was approved by that court in January.  <em>See</em> Tex.Elec.Code Ann., Art. 2.04 (1) (Vernon Supp.1980).  Election precincts are subunits of commissioners\' precincts that determine where a voter registers and votes.  Because the reapportionment plan submitted by the Commissioners Court resulted in the splitting of several election precincts between two commissioners\' precincts, petitioners contend that the plan altered the boundaries of election precincts in violation of state law.  Since we conclude that the Commissioners Court\'s authority under Texas law to enact this plan is irrelevant for purposes of \xc2\xa7 5 coverage, we need not resolve this question of state law.  At any rate, it is clear that the Commissioners Court possesses general authority to reapportion itself; petitioners challenge only the timing of the submission and adoption of the plan in this case.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T35" name="F35">Footnote 35</a>]</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that the interposition of a preclearance requirement will encourage dilatory tactics by incumbents who will continue to represent malapportioned districts during the review process.
