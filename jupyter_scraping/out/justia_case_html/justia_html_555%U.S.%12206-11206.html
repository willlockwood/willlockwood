S. 575</a>, 602.  This categorical approach requires courts to choose the right category, and sometimes the choice is not obvious.  The nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect.  The state statute at issue places together in a single section several different kinds of behavior, which, as relevant here, may be categorized either as failure to report for detention or as escape from custody.  Failure to report is a separate crime from escape.  Its underlying behavior differs from the more aggressive behavior underlying escape, and it is listed separately in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s title and body and is of a different felony class than escape.  At the same time, the statutory phrases setting forth the various kinds of failure to report describe roughly similar forms of behavior, thus constituting a single category.  Consequently, for ACCA purposes, the statute contains at least two separate crimes, escape and failure to report.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to report\xe2\x80\x9d crime does not satisfy ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  Although it is punishable by imprisonment exceeding one year, it satisfies none of the other parts of the definition.  Most critically, it does not \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Conceptually speaking, the crime amounts to a form of inaction, and there is no reason to believe that an offender who fails to report is otherwise doing something that poses a serious potential risk of physical injury.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that a failure to report reveals the offender\xe2\x80\x99s special, strong aversion to penal custody\xe2\x80\x94pointing to 3 state and federal cases over 30 years in which individuals shot at officers attempting to recapture them\xe2\x80\x94is unconvincing.  Even assuming the relevance of violence that may occur long after an offender fails to report, the offender\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to penal custody is beside the point.  The question is whether such an offender is significantly more likely than others to attack or resist an apprehender, thereby producing a serious risk of physical injury.  Here a United States Sentencing Commission report, showing no violence in 160 federal failure-to-report cases over 2 recent years, helps provide a negative answer.  The three reported cases to which the Government points do not show the contrary.  Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years; federal alone versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they show only a statistically insignificant risk of physical violence.  And the Government provides no other empirical information.

At sentencing the Government asked the District Court to apply ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s 15-year mandatory prison term because, in its view, three of Chambers\xe2\x80\x99 prior convictions qualified as an ACCA \xe2\x80\x9cserious drug offense\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chambers conceded that two of his prior convictions, namely a 1998 conviction for robbery and aggravated battery and a 1999 drug crime conviction, fell within ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions.  But he disputed the Government\xe2\x80\x99s claim as to a third conviction.  That third conviction arose out of Chambers\xe2\x80\x99 sentence for his 1998 robbery and battery offense.  The sentence required Chambers to report to a local prison for 11 weekends of incarceration.  He failed to report for weekend confinement on four occasions, and was later convicted of the crime of \xe2\x80\x9cfail[ing] to report to a penal institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \xc2\xa75/31\xe2\x80\x936(a) (West Supp. 2008).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court treated the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to report\xe2\x80\x9d as a form of what the relevant Illinois statute calls \xe2\x80\x9cescape from [a] penal institution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>and held that the crime qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under ACCA.  The Court of Appeals agreed.  473 F.\xc2\xa03d 724 (CA7 2007).  In light of disagreement among the Circuits as to whether failure to report for imprisonment falls within the scope of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d we granted certiorari.  Compare <em>United States</em> v. <em>Winn</em>, 364 F.\xc2\xa03d 7, 12 (CA1 2004)<em> </em>(failure to report is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Piccolo</em>, 441 F.\xc2\xa03d 1084, 1088 (CA9 2006) (failure to report is not a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We initially consider the classification of the crime.  In ordinary speech, words such as \xe2\x80\x9ccrime\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d can refer not only to a generic <em>set </em>of acts, say, burglary in general, but also to a specific act committed on a particular occasion, say <em>the </em>burglary that the defendant engaged in last month.  We have made clear, however, that, for purposes of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definitions, it is the generic sense of the word \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d that counts.  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 602 (1990); see also <em>Shepard</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/13/index.html">544 U. S. 13</a>, 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (2005)<em>.</em>  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s defining language, read naturally, uses \xe2\x80\x9cfelony\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to a crime as generally committed.  And by so construing the statute, one avoids the practical difficulty of trying to ascertain at sentencing, perhaps from a paper record mentioning only a guilty plea, whether the present defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prior crime, as committed on a particular occasion, did or did not involve violent behavior.  See <em>id.,</em> at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.<em> </em> Thus, to determine, for example, whether attempted burglary is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d we have had to examine, not the unsuccessful burglary the defendant attempted on a particular occasion, but the generic crime of attempted burglary.  <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/192/index.html">550 U. S. 192</a>, 204\xe2\x80\x93206 (2007).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This categorical approach requires courts to choose the right category.  And sometimes the choice is not obvious.  The nature of the behavior that likely underlies a statutory phrase matters in this respect.  Where Massachusetts, for example, placed within a single, separately numbered statutory section (entitled \xe2\x80\x9cBreaking and entering at night,\xe2\x80\x9d Mass. Gen. Laws Ann., ch. 266, \xc2\xa716 (West 2008)) burglary of a \xe2\x80\x9cbuilding, ship, vessel or vehicle,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court found that the behavior underlying, say, breaking into a building, differs so significantly from the behavior underlying, say, breaking into a vehicle, that for ACCA purposes a sentencing court must treat the two as different crimes.  See <em>Shepard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317; see also <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 598.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Illinois statute now before us, like the Massachusetts statute, places together in a single numbered statutory section several different kinds of behavior.  It separately describes those behaviors as (1) escape from a penal institution, (2) escape from the custody of an employee of a penal institution, (3) failing to report to a penal institution, (4) failing to report for periodic imprisonment, (5) failing to return from furlough, (6) failing to return from work and day release, and (7) failing to abide by the terms of home confinement.  Ill. Comp. Stat., ch. 720, \xc2\xa75/31\xe2\x80\x936(a); see Appendix A, <em>infra.</em>  We know from the state-court information in the record that Chambers pleaded guilty to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly fail[ing] to report\xe2\x80\x9d for periodic imprisonment \xe2\x80\x9cto the Jefferson County Jail, a penal institution.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 68; see <em>Shepard</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 25 (sentencing court may look, for example, to charging document, plea agreement, jury instructions, or transcript of plea colloquy to determine crime at issue).  But we must decide whether for ACCA purposes a failure to report counts as a separate crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the lower courts, we believe that a failure to report (as described in the statutory provision\xe2\x80\x99s third, fourth, fifth, and sixth phrases) is a separate crime, different from escape (the subject matter of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s first and second phrases), and from the potentially less serious failure to abide by the terms of home confinement (the subject of the final phrase).  The behavior that likely underlies a failure to report would seem less likely to involve a risk of physical harm than the less passive, more aggressive behavior underlying an escape from custody.  See <em>Begay</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 7).  Moreover, the statute itself not only lists escape and failure to report separately (in its title and its body) but also places the behaviors in two different felony classes (Class Two and Class Three) of different degrees of seriousness.  See Appendix A, <em>infra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, we believe the statutory phrases setting forth various kinds of failure to report (or to return) describe roughly similar forms of behavior.  Each is characterized by a failure to present oneself for detention on a specified occasion.  All amount to variations on a single theme.  For that reason we consider them as together constituting a single category.  Cf. <em>James</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 207\xe2\x80\x93209 (determining that where separately listed behaviors pose a similar degree of risk, sentencing courts may consider all listed behaviors as a single crime).  We consequently treat the statute for ACCA purposes as containing at least two separate crimes, namely escape from custody on the one hand, and a failure to report on the other.  Failure to abide by home confinement terms\xe2\x80\x94potentially the least serious of the offenses\xe2\x80\x94is not at issue here.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now must consider whether the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to report\xe2\x80\x9d crime satisfies ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  It clearly satisfies the first part of that definition, for it is a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).  But it satisfies none of the other parts.  It does not have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).  It does not consist of \xe2\x80\x9cburglary, arson, or extortion,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cinvolv[e] use of explosives.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  And, more critically for present purposes, it does not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Begay</em>, 553 U. S., at  ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934); <em>id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 6) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (treating serious risk of physical injury to another as critical definitional factor); <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 2) (Alito, J., dissenting) (same).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Conceptually speaking, the crime amounts to a form of inaction, a far cry from the \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct\xe2\x80\x9d potentially at issue when an offender uses explosives against property, commits arson, burgles a dwelling or residence, or engages in certain forms of extortion.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 7)<em>. </em> While an offender who fails to report must of course be doing <em>something </em>at the relevant time, there is no reason to believe that the <em>something </em>poses a serious potential risk of physical injury.  Cf. <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at 203\xe2\x80\x93204.<em> </em>To the contrary, an individual who fails to report would seem unlikely, not likely, to call attention to his whereabouts by simultaneously engaging in additional violent and unlawful conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argues that a failure to report reveals the offender\xe2\x80\x99s special, strong aversion to penal custody.  And it points to three cases arising over a period of 30 years in which reported opinions indicate that individuals shot at officers attempting to recapture them.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Eaglin</em>, 571 F.\xc2\xa02d 1069, 1072 (CA9 1977); <em>State</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, 245 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 288, 291 (Mo. Ct. App. 2008); <em>State</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, 96 Wash. App. 369, 371\xe2\x80\x93372, 979 P.\xc2\xa02d 898, 899 (1999).  But even if we assume for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake the relevance of violence that may occur long after an offender fails to report, we are not convinced by the Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  The offender\xe2\x80\x99s aversion to penal custody, even if special, is beside the point.  The question is whether such an offender is significantly more likely than others to attack, or physically to resist, an apprehender, thereby producing a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  And here a United States Sentencing Commission report helps provide a conclusive, negative answer.  See Report on Federal Escape Offenses in Fiscal Years 2006 and 2007, p.\xc2\xa06 (Nov. 2008) (hereinafter Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Report), reprinted in part in Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  See also 473 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 727 (Posner, J.) (urging that such research be done).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Report identifies every federal case in 2006 or 2007 in which a federal sentencing court applied the Sentencing Guideline, \xe2\x80\x9cEscape, Instigating or Assisting Escape,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72P1.1 (Nov. 2008), and in which sufficient detail was provided, say, in the presentence report, about the circumstances of the crime to permit analysis.  The analysis included calculation of the likelihood that violence would accompany commission of the escape or the offender\xe2\x80\x99s later apprehension.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of 414 such cases, 160 involved a failure to report either for incarceration (42) or for custody after having been temporarily released (118).  Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Report<em> </em>7; see also Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  Of these 160 cases, none at all involved violence\xe2\x80\x94not during commission of the offense itself, not during the offender\xe2\x80\x99s later apprehension\xe2\x80\x94although in 5 instances (3.1%) the offenders were armed.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The upshot is that the study strongly supports the intuitive belief that failure to report does not involve a serious potential risk of physical injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The three reported cases to which the Government points do not show the contrary.  The Sentencing Commission culled its 160 instances from a set of federal sentences imposed over a period of 2 years.  The Government apparently culled its three examples from a set of state and federal sentences imposed over a period of 30 years.  Compare <em>Eaglin</em>, <em>supra </em>(CA9 1977) with <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em> (Mo. Ct. App. 2008).  Given the larger set, the presence of three instances of violence is consistent with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s data.  Simple multiplication (2 years versus 30 years; federal alone versus federal-plus-state) suggests that they show only a small risk of physical violence (less than one in several thousand).  And the Government provides no other empirical information.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons we conclude that the crime here at issue falls outside the scope of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).

S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 1) (dissenting opinion).  I nonetheless recognize that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>stare decisis</em> in respect to statutory interpretation has \xe2\x80\x98special force,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>John R. Sand &amp; Gravel Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 552 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 8), and I am sympathetic to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to provide a workable interpretation of the \xe2\x80\x9cresidual clause\xe2\x80\x9d of the Armed Career Criminal Act (ACCA), while retaining the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d that we adopted in <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 602 (1990).  In light of <em>Taylor</em> and <em>Begay</em>, I agree that this case should be remanded for resentencing.  I write separately, however, to emphasize that only Congress can rescue the federal courts from the mire into which ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s draftsmanship and <em>Taylor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d have pushed us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1986, when Congress enacted ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii), few could have foreseen the difficulties that lay ahead.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Only four months before Congress framed the residual clause, this Court upheld a state sentencing provision that imposed a mandatory minimum sentence where the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence that the defendant visibly possessed a firearm during the commission of certain felonies (including robbery).  See <em>McMillan</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/477/79/index.html">477 U. S. 79</a> (1986).  Legislating against the background of <em>McMillan</em>, Congress may have assumed that ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause would similarly require federal sentencing judges to determine whether the particular facts of a particular case triggered a mandatory minimum sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But history took a different track.  In <em>Taylor</em>, the Court held that ACCA requires \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentencing court to look only to the fact that the defendant had been convicted of crimes falling within certain categories, and not to the facts underlying the prior convictions.\xe2\x80\x9d  495 U. S., at 600.  Thus, we held that sentencing judges should apply a \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether an underlying state offense meets the \xe2\x80\x9cgeneric\xe2\x80\x9d definition of burglary that this Court\xe2\x80\x94not Congress\xe2\x80\x94created.  <em>Id.</em>, at 598.  The Court justified its decision with a 10-page discussion of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose and legislative history, <em>id.</em>, at 581\xe2\x80\x93590; see also <em>id.</em>, at 603 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (criticizing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach), and explained that its conclusion was necessary to undo \xe2\x80\x9can inadvertent<font b="1"> casualty [in ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s] complex drafting process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 589\xe2\x80\x93590.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s clarity has been the true inadvertent casualty.  After almost two decades with <em>Taylor</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach,\xe2\x80\x9d only one thing is clear:  ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s residual clause is nearly impossible to apply consistently.  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d to predicate offenses has created numerous splits among the lower federal courts,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the resolution of which could occupy this Court for years.  What is worse is that each new application of the residual clause seems to lead us further and further away from the statutory text.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, for example, turns on little more than a statistical analysis of a research report prepared by the United States Sentencing Commission.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; 10 (App. B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point, the only tenable, long-term solution is for Congress to formulate a specific list of expressly defined crimes that are deemed to be worthy of ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing enhancement.  That is the approach that Congress took in 1984, when it applied ACCA to two enumerated and expressly defined felonies.  See n.\xc2\xa01, <em>supra</em>.  And that approach is the only way to right ACCA\xe2\x80\x99s ship.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Congress originally enacted ACCA in 1984.

That statute, however, applied a mandatory sentencing enhancement to only two predicate felonies\xe2\x80\x94robbery and burglary\xe2\x80\x94which the statute expressly defined.  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. App. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71202(c)(8)\xe2\x80\x93(9) (1982 ed., Supp. II).  Congress did not add the undefined \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise clause\xe2\x80\x9d until 1986.
