UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x939712.\xe2\x80\x83Argued January 14, 2009\xe2\x80\x94Decided March 25, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">In exchange for petitioner Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea, the Government agreed to request (1) a three-level reduction in his offense level under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the ground that he had accepted responsibility for his crimes; and (2) a sentence at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range.  The District Court accepted the plea, but before Puckett was sentenced he assisted in another crime.  As a result, the Government opposed any reduction in Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s offense level, and the District Court denied the three-level reduction.  On appeal, Puckett raised for the first time the argument that by backing away from its reduction request, the Government had broken the plea agreement.  The Fifth Circuit found that Puckett had forfeited that claim by failing to raise it below; applied Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s plain-error standard for unpreserved claims of error; and held that, although the error had occurred and was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the third prong of plain-error analysis in that he failed to demonstrate that his ultimate sentence was affected, especially since the District Judge had found that acceptance-of-responsibility reductions for defendants who continued to engage in criminal activity were so rare as \xe2\x80\x9cto be unknown.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s plain-error test applies to a forfeited claim, like Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s, that the Government failed to meet its obligations under a plea agreement, and applies in the usual fashion.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) instructs parties how to preserve claims of error: \xe2\x80\x9cby informing the court\xe2\x80\x94when [a] ruling \xe2\x80\xa6 is made or sought\xe2\x80\x94of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the court\xe2\x80\x99s action and the grounds for that objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  A party\xe2\x80\x99s failure to preserve a claim ordinarily prevents him from raising it on appeal, but Rule 52(b) recognizes a limited exception for plain errors.  \xe2\x80\x9cPlain-error review\xe2\x80\x9d involves four prongs: (1) there must be an error or defect that the appellant has not affirmatively waived,<em> United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a>, 732\xe2\x80\x93733; (2) it must be clear or obvious, see <em>id.</em>, at 734; (3) it must have affected the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights, <em>i.e.,</em> \xe2\x80\x9caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>; and (4) if the three other prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the <em>discretion</em> to remedy the error if it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 736.  The question here is not <em>whether</em> plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but what conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident application.  The breach undoubtedly violates the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rights, but the defendant has the opportunity to seek vindication of those rights in district court; if he fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the consequences for that forfeiture as it does for all others.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Neither Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s doctrinal arguments nor the practical considerations that he raises counsel against applying plain-error review in the present context.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach of the plea agreement does not retroactively cause the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea to have been unknowing or involuntary.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Santobello</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/257/index.html">404 U. S. 257</a>, does not govern, since the question whether an error can be found harmless is different from the question whether it can be subjected to plain-error review.  Puckett is wrong in contending that no purpose is served by applying plain-error review: There is much to be gained by inducing the objection to be made at the trial court level, where (among other things) the error can often be remedied.  And not all plea breaches will satisfy the doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s four prongs.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72113(a), (d), and one count of using a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence, \xc2\xa7924(c)(1).  He negotiated a plea agreement with the Government, which was filed with the District Court on September 3, 2003.  As part of that deal, Puckett agreed to plead guilty to both counts, waive his trial rights, and cooperate with the Government by being truthful regarding his participation in criminal activities.  App. 51a\xe2\x80\x9353a.  In exchange, the Government agreed to the following two terms:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c8. The government agrees that Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of responsibility and thereby qualifies for a three-level reduction in his offense level.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c9. The government also agrees to request that Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s sentence be placed at the lowest end of the guideline level deemed applicable by the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 54a.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To satisfy the first of these obligations, the Government filed a motion in the District Court pursuant to \xc2\xa73E1.1 of the United States Sentencing Commission\xe2\x80\x99s Guidelines Manual (Nov. 2003) (USSG).  That provision directs sentencing courts to decrease a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s offense level under the Guidelines by two levels if he \xe2\x80\x9cclearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense,\xe2\x80\x9d and by a third level \xe2\x80\x9cupon motion of the government stating that the defendant has assisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Two weeks later, the District Court held a plea colloquy, see Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 11(b), and accepted Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s plea.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because of delays due to health problems experienced by Puckett, sentencing did not take place for almost three years.  In the interim, Puckett assisted another man in a scheme to defraud the Postal Service, and confessed that assistance (under questioning) to a probation officer.  The officer prepared an addendum to Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report recommending that he receive <em>no</em> \xc2\xa73E1.1 reduction for acceptance of responsibility, on the theory that true acceptance of responsibility requires termination of criminal conduct.  See USSG \xc2\xa73E1.1, comment., n. 1(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When sentencing finally did take place on May 4, 2006, Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s counsel objected to the addendum, pointing out that the Government had filed a motion requesting that the full three-level reduction in offense level be granted.  The District Judge turned to the prosecutor, who responded that the motion was filed \xe2\x80\x9ca long time ago,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 79a, before Puckett had engaged in the additional criminal behavior.  She made clear that the Government opposed any reduction in Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s offense level for acceptance of responsibility.  The probation officer then added his view that under the Guidelines, a reduction would be improper.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After hearing these submissions, the District Judge concluded that even assuming he had the discretion to grant the reduction, he would not do so.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t\xe2\x80\x99s so rare [as] to be unknown around here where one has committed a crime subsequent to the crime for which they appear before the court and for them even then to get the three points.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 80a\xe2\x80\x9381a.  He agreed, however, to follow the recommendation that the Government made, pursuant to its commitment in the plea agreement, that Puckett be sentenced at the low end of the applicable Guidelines range, which turned out to be 262 months in prison for the armed bank robbery and a mandatory minimum consecutive term of 84 months for the firearm crime.  Had the District Court granted the three-level reduction for acceptance of responsibility, the bottom of the Guidelines range would have been 188 months for the robbery; the firearm sentence would not have been affected.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Importantly, at no time during the exchange did Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s counsel object that the Government was violating its obligations under the plea agreement by backing away from its request for the reduction.  He never cited the relevant provision of the plea agreement.  And he did not move to withdraw Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s plea on grounds that the Government had broken its sentencing promises.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Puckett did argue, <em>inter alia</em>,<em> </em>that the Government violated the plea agreement at sentencing.  The Government conceded that by objecting to the reduction for acceptance of responsibility, it had violated the obligation set forth in paragraph 8 of the agreement, but maintained that Puckett had forfeited this claim by failing to raise it in the District Court.  The Court of Appeals agreed, and applied the plain-error standard that Rule 52(b) makes applicable to unpreserved claims of error.  505 F.\xc2\xa03d 377, 384 (2007).  It held that although error had occurred and was obvious, Puckett had not satisfied the third prong of the plain-error analysis by demonstrating that the error affected his substantial rights, <em>i.e.</em>, caused him prejudice.  <em>Id.</em>, at 386.  Especially in light of the District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s statement that granting a reduction when the defendant had continued to engage in criminal conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cso rare [as] to be unknown,\xe2\x80\x9d Puckett could not show that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach had affected his ultimate sentence.  The Court of Appeals accordingly affirmed the conviction and sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 388.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 554 U. S. ___ (2008), to consider a question that has divided the Federal Courts of Appeals: whether Rule 52(b)\xe2\x80\x99s plain-error test applies to a forfeited claim, like Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s, that the Government failed to meet its obligations under a plea agreement.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Sealed Case</em>, 356 F. 3d 313, 315\xe2\x80\x93318 (CADC 2004) (discussing conflict among the Circuits).  Concluding that Rule 52(b) does apply and in the usual fashion, we now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a litigant believes that an error has occurred (to his detriment) during a federal judicial proceeding, he must object in order to preserve the issue.  If he fails to do so in a timely manner, his claim for relief from the error is forfeited.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo procedural principle is more familiar to this Court than that a . . . right may be forfeited in criminal as well as civil cases by the failure to make timely assertion of the right before a tribunal having jurisdiction to determine it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yakus</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/414/index.html">321 U. S. 414</a>, 444 (1944).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If an error is not properly preserved, appellate-court authority to remedy the error (by reversing the judgment, for example, or ordering a new trial) is strictly circumscribed.  There is good reason for this; \xe2\x80\x9canyone familiar with the work of courts understands that errors are a constant in the trial process, that most do not much matter, and that a reflexive inclination by appellate courts to reverse because of unpreserved error would be fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Padilla</em>, 415 F.\xc2\xa03d 211, 224 (CA1 2005) (en banc) (Boudin, C. J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This limitation on appellate-court authority serves to induce the timely raising of claims and objections, which gives the district court the opportunity to consider and resolve them.  That court is ordinarily in the best position to determine the relevant facts and adjudicate the dispute.   In the case of an actual or invited procedural error, the district court can often correct or avoid the mistake so that it cannot possibly affect the ultimate outcome.  And of course the contemporaneous-objection rule prevents a litigant from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sandbagging\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the court\xe2\x80\x94remaining silent about his objection and belatedly raising the error only if the case does not conclude in his favor.  Cf. <em>Wainwright</em> v. <em>Sykes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/72/index.html">433 U. S. 72</a>, 89 (1977); see also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Vonn</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/55/index.html">535 U. S. 55</a>, 72 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In federal criminal cases, Rule 51(b) tells parties how to preserve claims of error: \xe2\x80\x9cby informing the court\xe2\x80\x94when the court ruling or order is made or sought\xe2\x80\x94of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party\xe2\x80\x99s objection to the court\xe2\x80\x99s action and the grounds for that objection.\xe2\x80\x9d  Failure to abide by this contemporaneous-objection rule ordinarily precludes the raising on appeal of the unpreserved claim of trial error.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Young</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/1/index.html">470 U. S. 1</a>, 15, and n. 12 (1985).  Rule 52(b), however, recognizes a limited exception to that preclusion.  The Rule provides, in full: \xe2\x80\x9cA plain error that affects substantial rights may be considered even though it was not brought to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We explained in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a> (1993), that Rule 52(b) review\xe2\x80\x94so-called \xe2\x80\x9cplain-error review\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94involves four steps, or prongs.  First, there must be an error or defect\xe2\x80\x94some sort of \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eviation from a legal rule\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that has not been intentionally relinquished or abandoned, <em>i.e.</em>, affirmatively waived,<em> </em>by the appellant.  <em>Id.</em>, at 732\xe2\x80\x93733.  Second, the legal error must be clear or obvious, rather than subject to reasonable dispute.  See <em>id.</em>, at 734.  Third, the error must have affected the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights, which in the ordinary case means he must demonstrate that it \xe2\x80\x9caffected the outcome of the district court proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Fourth and finally, if the above three prongs are satisfied, the court of appeals has the <em>discretion</em> to remedy the error\xe2\x80\x94discretion which ought to be exercised only if the error \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 736 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Atkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/157/index.html">297 U. S. 157</a>, 160 (1936)).  Meeting all four prongs is difficult, \xe2\x80\x9cas it should be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dominguez Benitez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/74/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/74/index.html">542 U. S. 74</a>, 83, n. 9 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have repeatedly cautioned that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny unwarranted extension\xe2\x80\x9d of the authority granted by Rule 52(b) would disturb the careful balance it strikes between judicial efficiency and the redress of injustice, see <em>Young</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 15; and that the creation of an unjustified exception to the Rule would be \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven less appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/461/index.html">520 U. S. 461</a>, 466 (1997).  The real question in this case is not <em>whether</em> plain-error review applies when a defendant fails to preserve a claim that the Government defaulted on its plea-agreement obligations, but rather what conceivable reason exists for disregarding its evident application.  Such a breach is undoubtedly a violation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s rights, see <em>Santobello</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/257/index.html">404 U. S. 257</a>, 262 (1971), but the defendant has the opportunity to seek vindication of those rights in district court; if he fails to do so, Rule 52(b) as clearly sets forth the consequences for that forfeiture as it does for all others.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett puts forward several possible reasons why plain-error review should not apply in the present context.  We understand him to be making effectively four distinct arguments: two doctrinal, two practical.  We consider each set in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s primary precedent-based argument proceeds as follows: When the Government breaks a promise that was made to a defendant in the course of securing a guilty plea, the knowing and voluntary character of that plea retroactively vanishes, because (as it turns out) the defendant was not aware of its true consequences.  Since guilty pleas must be knowing and voluntary to be valid, <em>McCarthy</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/459/index.html">394 U. S. 459</a>, 466 (1969), the guilty plea is thus void, along with the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding waiver of his right to trial.  And because, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, a waiver of the right to trial must be made by the defendant personally, see <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/400/index.html">484 U. S. 400</a>, 417\xe2\x80\x93418, and n. 24 (1988), no action by counsel alone could resurrect the voided waiver.  Therefore, Puckett concludes, <em>counsel\xe2\x80\x99s</em> failure timely to object to a Government breach can have no effect on the analysis, and the court of appeals must always correct the error.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This elaborate analysis suffers from at least two defects.  First, there is nothing to support the proposition that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach of a plea agreement retroactively causes the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s agreement to have been unknowing or involuntary.  Any more than there is anything to support the proposition that a mere breach of contract retroactively causes the other party\xe2\x80\x99s promise to have been coerced or induced by fraud.  Although the analogy may not hold in all respects, plea bargains are essentially contracts.  See <em>Mabry</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/504/index.html">467 U. S. 504</a>, 508 (1984).  When the consideration for a contract fails\xe2\x80\x94that is, when one of the exchanged promises is not kept\xe2\x80\x94we do not say that the voluntary bilateral consent to the contract never existed, so that it is automatically and utterly void; we say that the contract was broken.  See 23 R. Lord, Williston on Contracts \xc2\xa763.1 (4th ed. 2002) (hereinafter Williston).  The party injured by the breach will generally be entitled to some remedy, which might include the right to rescind the contract entirely, see 26 <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa768.1 (4th ed. 2003); but that is not the same thing as saying the contract was never validly concluded.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So too here.  When a defendant agrees to a plea bargain, the Government takes on certain obligations.  If those obligations are not met, the defendant is entitled to seek a remedy, which might in some cases be rescission of the agreement, allowing him to take back the consideration he has furnished, <em>i.e.</em>, to withdraw his plea.  But rescission is not the only possible remedy; in <em>Santobello</em> we allowed for a resentencing at which the Government would fully comply with the agreement\xe2\x80\x94in effect, specific performance of the contract.  404 U. S., at 263.  In any case, it is entirely clear that a breach does not cause the guilty plea, when entered, to have been unknowing or involuntary.  It is precisely <em>because</em> the plea was knowing and voluntary (and hence valid) that the Government is obligated to uphold its side of the bargain.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, and perhaps more fundamentally, Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s argument confuses the concepts of waiver and forfeiture.  Nobody contends that Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s counsel has <em>waived</em>\xe2\x80\x94that is, intentionally relinquished or abandoned, <em>Olano</em>, 507 U. S., at 733\xe2\x80\x94Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s right to seek relief from the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach.  (If he had, there would be no error at all and plain-error analysis would add nothing.)  The objection is rather that Puckett <em>forfeited</em> the claim of error through his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise the argument in the District Court.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents requiring that certain waivers be personal, knowing, and voluntary are thus simply irrelevant.  Those holdings determine <em>whether error occurred</em>, but say nothing about the proper standard of review when the claim of error is not preserved.  The question presented by this case <em>assumes</em> error; only the standard of review is in dispute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s second doctrinal attack rests on our decision in <em>Santobello</em>.  In that case, the State had promised in a plea deal that it would make no sentencing recommendation, but the prosecutor (apparently unaware of that commitment) asked the state trial court to impose the maximum penalty of one year.  Defense counsel immediately objected.  404 U. S., at 259.  The trial judge proceeded anyway to impose the 1-year sentence, reassuring Santobello that the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation did not affect his decision.  <em>Id.</em>, at 259\xe2\x80\x93260.  This Court vacated the conviction and remanded the case because \xe2\x80\x9cthe interests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d would thus be best served.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 262.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett maintains that if the \xe2\x80\x9cinterests of justice\xe2\x80\x9d required a remand in <em>Santobello </em>even though the breach there was likely harmless, those same interests call for a remand <em>whenever</em> the Government reneges on a plea bargain, forfeiture or not.  We do not agree.  Whether an error can be found harmless is simply a different question from whether it can be subjected to plain-error review.  <em>Santobello</em> (given that the error in that case <em>was </em>preserved) necessarily addressed only the former.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doctrine and precedent aside, Puckett argues that practical considerations counsel against subjecting plea-breach claims to the rule of plain-error review.  Specifically, he contends that no purpose would be served by applying the rule; and that plea breaches will <em>always</em> satisfy its four prongs, making its application superfluous.  Accepting, <em>arguendo</em> (and <em>dubitante</em>),<em> </em>that policy concerns can ever authorize a departure from the Federal Rules, both arguments are wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett suggests that once the prosecution has broken its agreement, <em>e.g.</em>, by requesting a higher sentence than agreed upon, it is too late to \xe2\x80\x9cunring\xe2\x80\x9d the bell even if an objection is made: The district judge has already heard the request, and under <em>Santobello</em> it does not matter if he was influenced by it.  So why demand the futile objection?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, requiring the objection means the defendant cannot \xe2\x80\x9cgame\xe2\x80\x9d the system, \xe2\x80\x9cwait[ing] to see if the sentence later str[ikes] him as satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Vonn</em>, 535 U. S., at 73, and then seeking a second bite at the apple by raising the claim.  For another, the breach itself will not always be conceded.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In such a case, the district court if apprised of the claim will be in a position to adjudicate the matter in the first instance, creating a factual record and facilitating appellate review.  Thirdly, <em>some</em> breaches may be curable upon timely objection\xe2\x80\x94for example, where the prosecution simply forgot its commitment and is willing to adhere to the agreement.  And finally, if the breach is established but cannot be cured, the district court can grant an immediate remedy (<em>e.g.</em>, withdrawal of the plea or resentencing before a different judge) and thus avoid the delay and expense of a full appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett also contends that plain-error review \xe2\x80\x9cdoes no substantive work\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach of a plea agreement.  Brief for Petitioner 22.  He claims that the third prong, the prejudice prong, has no application, since plea-breach claims fall within \xe2\x80\x9ca special category of forfeited errors that can be corrected regardless of their effect on the outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Olano</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 735.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has several times declined to resolve whether \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d errors\xe2\x80\x94those that affect \xe2\x80\x9cthe framework within which the trial proceeds,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Fulminante</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/279/index.html">499 U.

Once again we need not answer that question, because breach of a plea deal is not a \xe2\x80\x9cstructural\xe2\x80\x9d error as we have used that term.  We have never described it as such, see <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 468\xe2\x80\x93469, and it shares no common features with errors we <em>have</em> held structural.  A plea breach does not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily render a criminal trial fundamentally unfair or an unreliable vehicle for determining guilt or innocence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U.

But the rule of contemporaneous objection is equally essential and desirable, and when the two collide we see no need to relieve the defendant of his usual burden of showing prejudice.  See <em>Olano</em>, 507 U. S., at 734.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendant whose plea agreement has been broken by the Government will not always be able to show prejudice, either because he obtained the benefits contemplated by the deal anyway (<em>e.g.</em>, the sentence that the prosecutor promised to request) or because he likely would not have obtained those benefits in any event (as is seemingly the case here).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, a defendant in Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s position has always suffered an impairment of his \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Olano</em>\xe2\x80\x99s third prong, because he has been convicted \xe2\x80\x9cin the absence of trial or compliance with the terms of the plea agreement dispensing with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to prove its case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 1 (opinion of Souter, J.).  But that is simply an <em>ipse dixit</em> recasting the conceded error\xe2\x80\x94breach of the plea agreement\xe2\x80\x94as the effect on substantial rights.  Any trial error can be said to impair substantial rights if the harm is defined as \xe2\x80\x9cbeing convicted at a trial tainted with [fill-in-the-blank] error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor does the fact that there is a \xe2\x80\x9cprotected liberty interest\xe2\x80\x9d at stake render this case different, see<em> post</em>, at 3.  That interest is always at stake in criminal cases.  Eliminating the third plain-error prong through semantics makes a nullity of <em>Olano</em>\xe2\x80\x99s instruction that a defendant normally \xe2\x80\x9cmust make a specific showing of prejudice\xe2\x80\x9d in order to obtain relief, 507 U. S., at 735.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett contends that the fourth prong of plain-error review likewise has no application because every breach of a plea agreement will constitute a miscarriage of justice.  That is not so.  The fourth prong is meant to be applied on a case-specific and fact-intensive basis.  We have emphasized that a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>per se</em> approach to plain-error review is flawed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Young</em>, 470 U. S., at 17, n.\xc2\xa014.  It is true enough that when the Government reneges on a plea deal, the integrity of the system may be called into question, but there may well be countervailing factors in particular cases.  Puckett is again a good example: Given that he obviously did not cease his life of crime, receipt of a sentencing reduction for <em>acceptance of responsibility</em> would have been so ludicrous as itself to compromise the public reputation of judicial proceedings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course the second prong of plain-error review also will often have some \xe2\x80\x9cbite\xe2\x80\x9d in plea-agreement cases.  Not all breaches will be clear or obvious.  Plea agreements are not always models of draftsmanship, so the scope of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s commitments will on occasion be open to doubt.  Moreover, the Government will often have a colorable (albeit ultimately inadequate) excuse for its nonperformance.

While we recognize that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach of a plea agreement is a serious matter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe seriousness of the error claimed does not remove consideration of it from the ambit of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, 520 U.

But it is hornbook law that misrepresentation requires an intent <em>at the time of contracting </em>not to perform.  26 Williston \xc2\xa769.11.  It is more difficult to explain the other precedent relied upon by Puckett\xe2\x80\x94our suggestion in <em>Mabry</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/504/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/504/index.html">467 U. S. 504</a>, 509 (1984), that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the prosecution breaches its promise with respect to an executed plea agreement, the defendant pleads guilty on a false premise, and hence his conviction cannot stand.\xe2\x80\x9d  That statement, like the one in <em>Brady</em>, was dictum.  Its conclusion that the conviction cannot stand is only sometimes true (if that is the remedy the court prescribes for the breach).  And even when the conviction is overturned, the reason is not that the guilty plea was unknowing or involuntary.  We disavow any aspect of the <em>Mabry </em>dictum that contradicts our holding today.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Indeed, in this case the Government might well have argued that it was excused from its obligation to assert \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrated acceptance of responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d because Puckett\xe2\x80\x99s ongoing criminal conduct hindered performance.  See 13 Williston \xc2\xa739.3 (4th ed. 2000).

I disagree with my colleagues with respect to the interest at stake for a criminal defendant in a case like this, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case turns on whether plain-error review applies to an unpreserved claim that the Government breached its plea agreement and on identifying the relevant effect, or substantial rights implicated, under the third prong of <em>United States</em> v. <em>Olano</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/725/index.html">507 U. S. 725</a>, 734 (1993).  I agree with the majority that plain error is the proper test, but depart from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the effect in question is length of incarceration for the offense charged (as to which the error here probably made no ultimate difference).  I would hold that the relevant effect is conviction in the absence of trial or compliance with the terms of the plea agreement dispensing with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s obligation to prove its case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first two conditions for recognizing plain error, that there be error and that it be clear, see <em>id.</em>, at 732\xe2\x80\x93734, are without doubt satisfied here.  Before sentencing, a colloquy in accordance with Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 laid the ground for satisfying the requirement that the error be obvious, by making a public record of the terms of the plea agreement between Puckett<em> </em>and the Government.  Both the written agreement and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s representation to the District Court included the Government\xe2\x80\x99s statement that Puckett qualified for a three-level reduction in his offense level under the Sentencing Guidelines, because of his acceptance of responsibility for his offense.  See App. 54a (\xe2\x80\x9cThe government agrees that Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of responsibility and thereby qualifies for a three-level reduction in his offense level\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 68a (\xe2\x80\x9cThe government agrees that Mr. Puckett has demonstrated acceptance of responsibility and thereby would qualify for a three level reduction in his offense level\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett does indeed appear to have satisfied the conditions on which the Government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment was premised: he accepted responsibility for committing \xe2\x80\x9chis offense[s]\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cassisted authorities in the investigation or prosecution of his own misconduct by timely notifying authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa73E1.1 (Nov. 2003).  His subsequent criminality (during the unusual 3-year break between his guilty plea and sentencing) was not a failure on his part to accept responsibility for his prior crimes (the benefit of which the Government had already received by the time Puckett pleaded guilty).  In any case, the Government could have insisted on a provision in the plea agreement allowing it to back out of its commitment if Puckett engaged in additional criminal conduct prior to sentencing, and did not do so.  It should therefore be bound by the terms of the agreement it made, whether or not Puckett was in fact entitled to the reduction.  In administering the criminal law no less than the civil, parties are routinely bound by agreements they wish they had not made.  This is why the Government has no choice but to admit that it breached the plea agreement when, at sentencing, it objected to the three-level reduction.  Despite its contention that the plain-error doctrine does not save Puckett from his failure to object at the sentencing hearing, the Government does not deny that a deal is a deal and it does not deny that it broke its word.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain-error doctrine will not, however, avail Puckett anything unless the remaining conditions set out in <em>Olano</em> are satisfied, the third requiring a showing that sentencing Puckett on a plea given in return for an unfulfilled promise by the Government violated his substantial rights.  See 507 U. S., at 734.  The majority understands the effect in question to be length of incarceration.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa04 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the rights acquired by the defendant relate to sentencing, the \xe2\x80\x98outcome\xe2\x80\x99 he must show to have been affected is his sentence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Since Puckett can hardly show that a court apprised of his subsequent criminality would have given him the three-level reduction even in the absence of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s breach, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view he cannot satisfy the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d criterion and so fails to qualify for correction of the admitted clear error.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I, on the contrary, would identify the effect on substantial rights as the criminal conviction itself, regardless of length of incarceration.  My reason is simply that under the Constitution the protected liberty interest in freedom from criminal taint, subject to the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s due process guarantee of fundamental fairness, is properly understood to require a trial or plea agreement honored by the Government before the stigma of a conviction can be imposed.  That protection does not vanish if a convicted defendant turns out to get a light sentence.  It is the trial leading to possible conviction, not the sentencing hearing alone, that is the focus of this guarantee, and it is the possibility of criminal conviction itself, without more, that calls for due process protection.  In a legal system constituted this way, it is hard to imagine anything less fair than branding someone a criminal not because he was tried and convicted, but because he entered a plea of guilty induced by an agreement the Government refuses to honor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Agreements must therefore be kept by the Government as well as by the individual, and if the plain-error doctrine can ever rescue a defendant from the consequence of forfeiting rights by inattention, it should be used when the Government has induced an admission of criminality by making an agreement that it deliberately breaks after the defendant has satisfied his end of the bargain.  Redressing such fundamentally unfair behavior by the Government, whether by vacating the plea or enforcing the plea agreement, see <em>Santobello</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/257/index.html">404 U. S. 257</a>, 263 (1971), is worth the undoubted risk of allowing a defendant to game the system and the additional administrative burdens, see <em>ante</em>, at 5, 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  If the Judiciary is worried about gamesmanship and extra proceedings, all it needs to do is to minimize their likelihood by making it plain that it will require the Government to keep its word or seek rescission of the plea agreement if it has cause to do so.<font b="1">  Thus, I would find that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s substantial rights have been violated whenever the Government breaches a plea agreement, unless the defendant got just what he bargained for anyway from the sentencing court.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What I have said about the third <em>Olano</em> criterion determines my treatment of the fourth, addressing whether leaving the error uncorrected \xe2\x80\x9cmay be said \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98seriously [to] affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Olano</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 744 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Atkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/157/index.html">297 U. S. 157</a>, 160 (1936)).  If I am right that in this case the protected interest is in the guarantee that no one is liable to spend a day behind bars as a convict without a trial or his own agreement, then the fairness and integrity of the Judicial Branch suffer when a court imprisons a defendant after he pleaded guilty in reliance on a plea agreement, only to have the Government repudiate the obligation it agreed upon.  That is precisely what happened here, yet the Judiciary denies relief under an appellate procedure for correcting patent error.  Judicial repute does not escape without damage in the eyes of anyone who sees beyond the oddity of this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Puckett is entitled to relief because he and every other defendant who may make an agreement with the Government are entitled to take the Government at its word.  Puckett insists that the Government keep its word, and if we are going to have a plain-error doctrine at all, the Judiciary has no excuse for closing this generally available avenue of redress to Puckett or to any other criminal defendant standing in his shoes.</p>\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div><font b="1">\n</font></div>'
