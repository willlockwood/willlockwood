S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(1).  The Act defines \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as, <em>inter alia</em>, a crime punishable by more than one year\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment that \xe2\x80\x9cis burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (hereinafter clause (ii)).  After petitioner Begay pleaded guilty to felony possession of a firearm, his presentence report revealed he had 12 New Mexico convictions for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), which state law makes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it.  Based on these convictions, the sentencing judge concluded that Begay had three or more \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d convictions and, therefore, sentenced him to an enhanced 15-year sentence.  The Tenth Circuit rejected Begay\xe2\x80\x99s claim that DUI is not a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Act.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> \xc2\xa0New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s felony DUI crime falls outside the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s clause (ii) \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Whether a crime is a violent felony is determined by how the law defines it and not how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.  Pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Even assuming that DUI involves conduct that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d under clause (ii), the crime falls outside the clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope because it is simply too unlike clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s example crimes to indicate that Congress intended that provision to cover it.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(i)\xc2\xa0Clause (ii)\xe2\x80\x99s listed examples\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, and crimes involving the use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94should be read as limiting the crimes the clause covers to those that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.  Their presence in the statute  indicates that Congress meant for the statute to cover only <em>similar c</em>rimes, rather than <em>every </em>crime that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  If Congress meant the statute to be all encompassing, it would not have needed to include the examples at all.  Moreover, if clause (ii) were meant to include <em>all </em>risky crimes, Congress likely would not have included clause (i), which includes crimes that have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  And had Congress included the examples solely for quantitative purposes, demonstrating no more than the degree of risk of physical injury sufficient to bring a crime within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope, it would likely have chosen examples that better illustrated the degree of risk it had in mind rather than these that are far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d just after the examples is sufficient to demonstrate that they do not limit the clause\xe2\x80\x99s scope is rejected because \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d can refer to a crime that is, <em>e.g.,</em> similar to the examples in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the way or manner in which it produces that risk.  Pp. 4\xe2\x80\x937.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(ii)\xc2\xa0DUI differs from the example crimes in at least one important respect: The examples typically involve purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, whereas DUI statutes typically do not.  When viewed in terms of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purposes, this distinction matters considerably.  The Act looks to past crimes to determine which offenders create a special danger by possessing a gun.  In this respect, a history of crimes involving purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct, which shows an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point a gun and pull the trigger, is different from a history of DUI, which does not involve the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).  The question in this case is whether driving under the influence of alcohol is a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as the Act defines it.  We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal law prohibits a previously convicted felon from possessing a firearm.  \xc2\xa7922(g)(1) (2000 ed.). A related provision provides for a prison term of up to<em> </em>10 years for an ordinary offender.  \xc2\xa7924(a)(2).  The Armed Career Criminal Act imposes a more stringent 15-year mandatory minimum sentence on an offender who has three prior convictions \xe2\x80\x9cfor a violent felony or a serious drug offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. V).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act defines a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cany crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(i)\xe2\x80\x82has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another; or</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(ii)\xe2\x80\x82is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">We here consider whether driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI), as set forth in New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s criminal statutes, falls within the scope of the second clause.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relevant background circumstances include the following: In September 2004, New Mexico police officers received a report that Larry Begay, the petitioner here, had threatened his sister and aunt with a rifle.  The police arrested him.  Begay subsequently conceded he was a felon and pleaded guilty to a federal charge of unlawful possession of a firearm in violation of \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  Begay\xe2\x80\x99s presentence report said that he had been convicted a dozen times for DUI, which under New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s law, becomes a felony (punishable by a prison term of more than one year) the fourth (or subsequent) time an individual commits it.  See N.\xc2\xa0M. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa766\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x93102(G) to (J) (Supp. 2007).  The sentencing judge consequently found that Begay had at least three prior convictions for a crime \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\xe2\x80\x9d  377 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1141, 1143 (NM 2005).  The judge also concluded that Begay\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cthree felony DUI convictions involve conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1145.  The judge consequently concluded that Begay had three or more prior convictions for a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d and should receive a sentence that reflected a mandatory minimum prison term of 15 years.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Begay, claiming that DUI is not a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d within the terms of the statute, appealed.  The Court of Appeals panel by a vote of 2 to 1 rejected that claim.  470 F.\xc2\xa03d 964 (CA10 2006).  Begay sought certiorari, and we agreed to decide the question.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s DUI statute makes it a crime (and a felony after three earlier convictions) to \xe2\x80\x9cdrive a vehicle within [the] state\xe2\x80\x9d if the driver \xe2\x80\x9cis under the influence of intoxicating liquor\xe2\x80\x9d (or has an alcohol concentration of .08 or more in his blood or breath within three hours of having driven the vehicle resulting from \xe2\x80\x9calcohol consumed before or while driving the vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa766\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x93102(A), (C).  In determining whether this crime is a violent felony, we consider the offense generically, that is to say, we examine it in terms of how the law defines the offense and not in terms of how an individual offender might have committed it on a particular occasion.  See <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/575/index.html">495 U. S. 575</a>, 602 (1990) (adopting this \xe2\x80\x9ccategorical approach\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 550 U. S. ___ , ___ (2007) (slip op., at 14\xe2\x80\x9315) (attempted burglary is a violent felony even if, on <em>some </em>occasions, it can be committed in a way that poses no serious risk of physical harm).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also take as a given that DUI does not fall within the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s <em>clause (i)</em> \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  DUI, as New Mexico defines it, nowhere \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we assume that the lower courts were right in concluding that DUI involves conduct that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Drunk driving is an extremely dangerous crime.  In the United States in 2006, alcohol-related motor vehicle crashes claimed the lives of more than 17,000 individuals and harmed untold amounts of property.  National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., Traffic Safety Facts, 2006 Traffic Safety Annual Assessment\xe2\x80\x94Alcohol-Related Fatalities 1 (No. 810821, Aug. 2007), http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/Pubs/810821.PDF (as visited Apr. 11, 2008, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Even so, we find that DUI falls outside the scope of clause (ii).  It is simply too unlike the provision\xe2\x80\x99s listed examples for us to believe that Congress intended the provision to cover it.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s listed examples\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94illustrate the kinds of crimes that fall within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  Their presence indicates that the statute covers only <em>similar </em>crimes, rather than <em>every </em>crime that \xe2\x80\x9cpresents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  If Congress meant the latter, <em>i.e.</em>, if it meant the statute to be all-encompassing, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all.  Without them, clause (ii) would cover <em>all</em> crimes that present a \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Ibid</em>.  Additionally, if Congress meant clause (ii) to include <em>all </em>risky crimes, why would it have included clause (i)?  A crime which has as an element the \xe2\x80\x9cuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d against the person (as clause (i) specifies) is likely to create \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury\xe2\x80\x9d and would seem to fall within the scope of clause (ii).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, Congress <em>might </em>have included the examples solely for quantitative purposes.  Congress might have intended them to demonstrate no more than the degree of risk sufficient to bring a crime within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  But were that the case, Congress would have likely chosen examples that better illustrated the \xe2\x80\x9cdegree of risk\xe2\x80\x9d it had in mind.  Our recent case, <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>\xe2\x80\x94where we considered only matters of degree, <em>i.e.</em>, whether the amount of risk posed by attempted burglary was comparable to the amount of risk posed by the example crime of burglary\xe2\x80\x94illustrates the difficulty of interpreting the examples in this respect.  Compare 550 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9313), with <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 2, 5\xe2\x80\x936, 16\xe2\x80\x9317) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Indeed, the examples are so far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 only reason for including them.  See <em>id</em>., at ___ (slip op., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress provided examples [that] \xe2\x80\xa6 have little in common, most especially with respect to the level of risk of physical injury that they pose\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations taken together convince us that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to give effect . . . to every clause and word\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of this statute, we should read the examples as limiting the crimes that clause (ii) covers to crimes that are roughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risk posed, to the examples themselves.  <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Menasche</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/index.html">348 U. S. 528</a>, 538\xe2\x80\x93539 (1955); some internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Leocal</em> v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/1/index.html">543 U. S. 1</a>, 12 (2004) (describing the need to interpret a statute in a way that gives meaning to each word).    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence complains that our interpretive approach is insufficiently specific.  See <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (Scalia<font caps="1">, J., concurring in judgment).  But the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s own approach demands a crime-by-crime analysis, uses a standard of measurement (comparative degree of risk) that even the concurrence admits is often \xe2\x80\x9cunclear,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 4, requires the concurrence to turn here to the still less clear \xe2\x80\x9crule of lenity,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6, and, as we explain, is less likely to reflect Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (recognizing inability to measure quantitative seriousness of risks associated with DUI).   </font></p><font caps="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s history offers further support for our conclusion that the examples in clause (ii) limit the scope of the clause to crimes that are similar to the examples themselves.  Prior to the enactment of the current language, the Act applied its enhanced sentence to offenders with \xe2\x80\x9cthree previous convictions for robbery or burglary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, 495 U. S., at 581 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Congress sought to expand that definition to include both crimes against the person (clause (i)) and certain physically risky crimes against property (clause (ii)).  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93849, p. 3 (1986) (hereinafter H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.).  When doing so, Congress rejected a broad proposal that would have covered <em>every </em>offense that involved a substantial risk of the use of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98physical force against the person or property of another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 583 (quoting S. 2312, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986); H.\xc2\xa0R. 4639, 99th Cong., 2d Sess. (1986)).<font b="1">  Instead, it added the present examples.  And in the relevant House Report, it described clause (ii) as including \xe2\x80\x9cState and Federal felonies against property such as burglary, arson, extortion, use of explosives and <em>similar </em>crimes as predicate offenses where the conduct involved presents a serious risk of injury to a person.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep., at 5 (emphasis added).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the statute places the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d just after the examples, so that the provision covers a felony that is one of the example crimes \xe2\x80\x9cor <em>otherwise </em>involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (emphasis added).  But we cannot agree with the Government that the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d is <em>sufficient</em> to demonstrate that the examples do not limit the scope of the clause.  That is because the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d <em>can</em> (we do not say <em>must</em>, cf. <em>post</em>, at 4 (Scalia<font caps="1">, J., concurring in judgment)) refer to a crime that is similar to the listed examples in some respects but different in others\xe2\x80\x94similar say in respect to the degree of risk it produces, but different in respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cway or manner\xe2\x80\x9d in which it produces that risk.

The listed crimes all typically involve purposeful, \xe2\x80\x9cviolent,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d conduct.  470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part); see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 598 (\xe2\x80\x9cburglary\xe2\x80\x9d is an unlawful or unprivileged entry into a building or other structure with \xe2\x80\x9cintent to commit a crime\xe2\x80\x9d); ALI Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7220.1(1) (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9carson\xe2\x80\x9d is causing a fire or explosion with <em>\xe2\x80\x9c</em>the purpose<em> </em>of,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cdestroying a building \xe2\x80\xa6 of another\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdamaging any property \xe2\x80\xa6 to collect insurance\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., \xc2\xa7223.4 (extortion is \xe2\x80\x9cpurposely\xe2\x80\x9d obtaining property of another through threat of, <em>e.g.</em>, inflicting \xe2\x80\x9cbodily injury\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Leocal</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9 (the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98use\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct\xe2\x80\x9d which fact helps bring it outside the scope of the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d).  That conduct is such that it makes more likely that an offender, later possessing a gun, will use that gun deliberately to harm a victim.  Crimes committed in such a purposeful, violent, and aggressive manner are \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially more dangerous when firearms are involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part).  And such crimes are \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic of the armed career criminal, the eponym of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By way of contrast, statutes that forbid driving under the influence, such as the statute before us, typically do not insist on purposeful, violent, and aggressive conduct; rather, they are, or are most nearly comparable to, crimes that impose strict liability, criminalizing conduct in respect to which the offender need not have had any criminal intent at all.  The Government argues that \xe2\x80\x9cthe knowing nature of the conduct that produces intoxication combined with the inherent recklessness of the ensuing conduct more than suffices\xe2\x80\x9d to create an element of intent.  Brief for United States 35.  And we agree with the Government that a drunk driver may very well drink on purpose.  But this Court has said that, unlike the example crimes, the conduct for which the drunk driver is convicted (driving under the influence) need not be purposeful or deliberate.  See <em>Leocal</em>, 543 U. S., at 11 (a DUI offense involves \xe2\x80\x9caccidental or negligent conduct\xe2\x80\x9d); see also 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]runk driving is a crime of negligence or recklessness, rather than violence or aggression\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When viewed in terms of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s basic purposes, this distinction matters considerably.  As suggested by its title, the Armed Career Criminal Act focuses upon the special danger created when a particular type of offender\xe2\x80\x94a violent criminal or drug trafficker\xe2\x80\x94possesses a gun.  See <em>Taylor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 587\xe2\x80\x93588; 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 981, n.\xc2\xa03 (McConnell, J., dissenting in part) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he title [of the Act] was not merely decorative\xe2\x80\x9d).  In order to determine which offenders fall into this category, the Act looks to past crimes.  This is because an offender\xe2\x80\x99s criminal history is relevant to the question whether he is a career criminal, or, more precisely, to the kind or degree of danger the offender would pose were he to possess a gun.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this respect\xe2\x80\x94namely, a prior crime\xe2\x80\x99s relevance to the possibility of future danger with a gun\xe2\x80\x94crimes involving intentional or purposeful conduct (as in burglary and arson) are different than DUI, a strict liability crime.  In both instances, the offender\xe2\x80\x99s prior crimes reveal a degree of callousness toward risk, but in the former instance they also show an increased likelihood that the offender is the kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.  We have no reason to believe that Congress intended a 15-year mandatory prison term where that increased likelihood does not exist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were we to read the statute without this distinction, its 15-year mandatory minimum sentence would apply to a host of crimes which, though dangerous, are not typically committed by those whom one normally labels \xe2\x80\x9carmed career criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Ark. Code Ann. \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x93103(a)(2)(A)(ii) (2007) (reckless polluters); 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71319(c)(1) (individuals who negligently introduce pollutants into the sewer system); 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71365(a) (individuals who recklessly tamper with consumer products); \xc2\xa71115 (seamen whose inattention to duty causes serious accidents).  We have no reason to believe that Congress intended to bring within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope these kinds of crimes, far removed as they are from the deliberate kind of behavior associated with violent criminal use of firearms. The statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of examples (and the other considerations we have mentioned) indicate the contrary.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach, on the other hand, would likely include these crimes within the statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony,\xe2\x80\x9d along with any other crime that can be said to present \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Alito, J.).  And it would do so because it believes such a result is compelled by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  See <em>ibid</em>.  But the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s explanation does not account for a key feature of that text\xe2\x80\x94namely, the four example crimes intended to illustrate what kind of \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d the statute covers.  The dissent at most believes that these examples are relevant only to define the \xe2\x80\x9crequisite\xe2\x80\x9d serious risk associated with a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6.  But the dissent does not explain what it means by \xe2\x80\x9crequisite,\xe2\x80\x9d nor does it describe how these various examples might help define that term in the context of this statute.  If they were in fact helpful on that score, we might expect more predictable results from a purely risk-based approach.  Compare <em>post</em>, at 1, 6\xe2\x80\x937 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment), with <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion).  Thus, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on these examples for a function they appear incapable of performing reads them out of the statute and, in so doing, fails to effectuate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purpose to punish only a particular subset of offender, namely career criminals.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinction we make does not minimize the seriousness of the risks attached to driving under the influence.   Nor does our argument deny that an individual with a criminal history of DUI might later pull the trigger of a gun.  (Indeed, we may have such an instance before us.  470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 965.)  Rather, we hold only that, for purposes of the particular statutory provision before us, a prior record of DUI, a strict liability crime, differs from a prior record of violent and aggressive crimes committed intentionally such as arson, burglary, extortion, or crimes involving the use of explosives.  The latter are associated with a likelihood of future violent, aggressive, and purposeful \xe2\x80\x9carmed career criminal\xe2\x80\x9d behavior in a way that the former are not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We consequently conclude that New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s crime of \xe2\x80\x9cdriving under the influence\xe2\x80\x9d falls outside the scope of the Armed Career Criminal Act\xe2\x80\x99s clause (ii) \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d definition.  And we reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals in relevant part and remand the case for proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered. </p>\n</font></font></font></div><font caps="1"><font b="1"><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></div><font caps="1"><font b="1"><font caps="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962609">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nBEGAY V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  Contrary to the Court, I conclude that the residual clause unambiguously encompasses <em>all</em> crimes that present a serious risk of injury to another.  But because I cannot say that drunk driving clearly poses such a risk (within the meaning of the statute), the rule of lenity brings me to concur in the judgment of the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last Term, in <em>James</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 550 U. S. ___ (2007), the Court held that attempted burglary qualifies as a violent felony under \xc2\xa7924(e).  It concluded that to determine whether a predicate crime falls under the residual clause, a court should first identify the enumerated crime to which the predicate crime is most closely analogous and then decide whether the risk posed by the predicate crime is roughly equivalent to the risk posed by the enumerated crime.  Because burglary was the enumerated crime most closely analogous to attempted burglary, and attempted burglary in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment posed roughly the same risk of physical injury as burglary, attempted burglary qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7924(e).  See <em>id.</em>, at ____ (slip op., at 15).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unfortunately, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach in deciding that case provided no guidance for deciding future cases that involve predicate crimes other than attempted burglary, particularly those for which there are no clear analogs among the enumerated crimes.  Pointing out that problem in dissent, I anticipated this very case: \xe2\x80\x9cIs, for example, driving under the influence of alcohol more analogous to burglary, arson, extortion, or a crime involving use of explosives?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ____ (slip op., at 2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My dissent set out a different approach to the statute.  In my view, the best way to interpret \xc2\xa7924(e) is first to determine which of the enumerated offenses poses the least serious risk of physical injury, and then to set that level of risk as the \xe2\x80\x9cserious potential risk\xe2\x80\x9d required by the statute.  Crimes that pose at least that serious a risk of injury are encompassed by the residual clause; crimes that do not are excluded.  In my judgment, burglary was the least risky crime among the enumerated offenses, and I therefore concluded that attempted burglary, which is less risky than burglary, is not covered by the residual clause.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held otherwise in <em>James</em>, and since this is a statutory case that holding<em> </em>has a strong claim to <em>stare decisis.  </em>But the concomitant of the sad fact that the theory of <em>James </em>has very limited application is the happy fact that its <em>stare decisis </em>effect is very limited as well.  It must be followed, I presume, for unenumerated crimes that are analogous to enumerated crimes (<em>e.g.</em>, attempted arson).  It provides no answer, and suggests no approach to an answer, where, as here, the predicate crime has no analog among the enumerated crimes.  For such cases I would therefore adhere to the principles I set forth in my <em>James</em> dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today the Court devises a different way to give concrete meaning to the residual clause.  Confronted with a predicate crime that has no obvious analog among the enumerated offenses, the Court engrafts a requirement onto the residual clause that a predicate crime involve \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  By doing so, it excludes a slew of crimes from the scope of the residual clause, including (not by happenstance) the crime at issue here, drunk driving.  Like <em>James, </em>this latest made-for-the-case improvisation does not (as my resolution does) provide a complete framework that will embrace all future cases.  There are still many crimes that are not analogous to the enumerated crimes (so that their status cannot be resolved by <em>James</em>) but do involve \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct\xe2\x80\x9d (so that their status cannot be resolved by today\xe2\x80\x99s <em>deus ex machina</em>).  Presumably some third (and perhaps fourth and fifth) gimmick will be devised to resolve those cases as they arise, leaving our brethren on the district courts and courts of appeals much room for enjoyable speculation.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But quite apart from its regrettable continuation of a piecemeal, suspenseful, Scrabble-like approach to the interpretation of this statute, the problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today is that it is not remotely faithful to the statute that Congress wrote.  There is simply no basis (other than the necessity of resolving the present case) for holding that the enumerated and unenumerated crimes must be similar in respects <em>other than the degree of risk that they pose</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court is correct that the clause \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d signifies a similarity between the enumerated and unenumerated crimes.  It is not, however, <em>any </em>old similarity, such as (to take a random example) \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct<em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  </em>Rather, it is the <em>particular </em>similarity specified after the \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>that they all pose a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.  They need not be similar in any other way.  As the Court correctly notes, the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d in this context means \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in a different way or manner.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; see also <em>James</em>, 550 U. S., at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 4); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 1729 (2d ed. 1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cin another way or in other ways\xe2\x80\x9d).  Therefore, by using the word \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d the writer draws a substantive connection between two sets only on one specific dimension\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whatever follows \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  What that means here is that \xe2\x80\x9ccommitting one of the enumerated crimes . . . is <em>one way</em> to commit a crime \xe2\x80\x98involv[ing] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x99; and that <em>other ways</em> of committing a crime of that character similarly constitute \xe2\x80\x98violent felon[ies].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>James</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court rejects this seemingly straightforward statutory analysis, reading the residual clause to mean that the unenumerated offenses must be similar to the enumerated offenses not only in the degree of risk they pose, but also \xe2\x80\x9cin kind,\xe2\x80\x9d despite the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d means that the <em>common</em> element of risk must be presented \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in a <em>different</em> way or manner.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x937 (emphasis added).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for this interpretation seems to be that the enumerated crimes are \xe2\x80\x9cso far from clear in respect to the degree of risk each poses that it is difficult to accept clarification in respect to degree of risk as Congress\xe2\x80\x99s only reason for including them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5.  While I certainly agree that the degree of risk associated with the enumerated crimes is unclear, I find it unthinkable that the solution to that problem is to write a different statute.  The phrase \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d limits inclusion in the statute only by a crime\xe2\x80\x99s degree of risk.  See <em>James</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 5).  The use of the adjective \xe2\x80\x9cserious\xe2\x80\x9d seems to me to signify a purely quantitative measure of risk.  If both an intentional and a negligent crime pose a 50% risk of death, could one be characterized as involving a \xe2\x80\x9cserious risk\xe2\x80\x9d and the other not?  Surely not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court supports its argument with that ever-ready refuge from the hardships of statutory text, the (judicially) perceived statutory purpose.  According to the Court, because the Armed Career Criminal Act is concerned with \xe2\x80\x9cthe special danger created when a particular type of offender\xe2\x80\x94a violent criminal or drug trafficker\xe2\x80\x94possesses a gun,\xe2\x80\x9d the statutory purpose favors applying \xc2\xa7924(e)\xe2\x80\x99s enhanced penalty only to those criminals \xe2\x80\x9cwho might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  I cannot possibly infer that purpose from the statute.  For all I know, the statute was meant to punish those who are indifferent to human life, or who are undeterred by the criminal penalties attached to the commission of other crimes (after all, the statute enhances penalties for drug traffickers, see \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A)).  While the Court\xe2\x80\x99s asserted purpose would surely be a reasonable one, it has no more grounding in the statutory text than do these other possibilities.  And what is more, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s posited purpose is positively contradicted by the fact that one of the enumerated crimes\xe2\x80\x94the unlawful use of explosives\xe2\x80\x94may involve merely negligent or reckless conduct.  See ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7220.2(2) (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cA person is guilty of a misdemeanor if he recklessly creates a risk of catastrophe in the employment of fire, explosives or other dangerous means\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa7220.3 (\xe2\x80\x9cA person is guilty of criminal mischief if he \xe2\x80\xa6 damages tangible property of another purposely, recklessly, or by negligence in the employment of fire, explosives, or other dangerous means\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court says that an interpretation of the residual clause that includes all crimes posing a serious risk of injury would render superfluous \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i), which provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d is any crime that \xe2\x80\x9chas as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person\xe2\x80\x9d of another.   <em>Ante</em>, at 4 (internal quotation marks omitted).  But the canon against surplusage has substantially less force when it comes to interpreting a broad residual clause like the one at issue here.  Though the second clause renders the first superfluous, it would raise no eyebrows to refer to \xe2\x80\x9ccrimes that entail the use of force and crimes that, while not entailing the use of force, nonetheless present a serious risk of injury to another person.\xe2\x80\x9d  In any event, the canon against surplusage merely helps decide between competing permissible interpretations of an ambiguous statute; it does not sanction writing in a requirement that Congress neglected to think of.  And finally, come to think of it, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s solution does nothing whatever to solve the supposed surplusage problem.  Crimes that include as an element \xe2\x80\x9cthe use \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against the person of another\xe2\x80\x9d are all embraced (and the reference to them thus rendered superfluous) by the requirement of \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct\xe2\x80\x9d that the Court invents.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under my interpretation of \xc2\xa7924(e), I must answer one question: Does drunk driving pose at least as serious a risk of physical injury to another as burglary?  From the evidence presented by the Government, I cannot conclude so.  Because of that, the rule of lenity requires that I resolve this case in favor of the defendant.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government cites the fact that in 2006, 17,062 persons died from alcohol-related car crashes, and that 15,121 of those deaths involved drivers with blood-alcohol concentrations of 0.08 or higher.  See Brief for United States 17.  Drunk driving is surely a national problem of great concern.  But the fact that it kills many people each year tells us very little about whether a single act of drunk driving \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  It may well be that an even greater number of deaths occurs annually to pedestrians crossing the street; but that hardly means that crossing the street presents a serious potential risk of injury.  Where the issue is \xe2\x80\x9crisk,\xe2\x80\x9d the annual number of injuries from an activity must be compared with the annual incidents of the activity.  Otherwise drunk driving could be said to pose a more serious risk of physical harm than murder.  In addition, drunk driving is a combination of two activities: (1) drinking and (2) driving.  If driving alone results in injury in a certain percentage of cases, it could hardly be said that the entirety of the risk posed by drunk driving can be attributed to the combination.  And finally, injuries to the drunk drivers themselves must be excluded from the calculus, because the statute counts only injuries to other persons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Needless to say, we do not have these relevant statistics.  And even if we did, we would still need to know similar statistics for burglary, which are probably even harder to come by.  This does not mean that I will never be able to identify a crime that falls under the residual clause.  For some crimes, the severity of the risk will be obvious.  Crimes like negligent homicide, see ALI, Model Penal Code \xc2\xa7210.4 (1980), conspiracy to commit a violent crime, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa75.03 (1985), inciting to riot, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72101, and the production of chemical weapons, \xc2\xa7229, certainly pose a more serious risk of physical injury to others than burglary.  (By contrast, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach eliminates from the residual clause all negligent crimes, even those that entail a 100% risk of physical injury such as negligent homicide.)  But I can do no more than guess as to whether drunk driving poses a more serious risk than burglary, and I will not condemn a man to a minimum of 15 years in prison on the basis of such speculation.  See <em>Ladner</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/169/index.html">358 U. S. 169</a>, 178 (1958).  Applying the rule of lenity to a statute that demands it, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals. </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962610">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nBEGAY V.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x94calls out for legislative clarification, and I am sympathetic to the result produced by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to craft a narrowing construction of this provision.  Unfortunately, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the statutory text, and I therefore respectfully\ndissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In September 2004, after a night of heavy drinking, petitioner pointed a rifle at his aunt and threatened to shoot if she did not give him money.  When she replied that she did not have any money, petitioner repeatedly pulled the trigger, but the rifle was unloaded and did not fire.  Petitioner then threatened his sister in a similar fashion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the time of this incident, petitioner was a convicted felon.  He had 12 prior convictions in New Mexico for driving under the influence of alcohol (DUI).  While DUI is generally a misdemeanor under New Mexico law, the offense of DUI after at least three prior DUI convictions is a felony requiring a sentence of 18 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  N.\xc2\xa0M. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa766\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x93102(G) (Supp. 2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner pleaded guilty to possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, in violation of 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  A violation of that provision generally carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 10 years, see \xc2\xa7924(a)(2), but the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that petitioner was subject to a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years because he had at least three prior convictions for the New Mexico felony of DUI after being convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions.  377 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1141, 1143\xe2\x80\x9345 (NM 2005); 470 F.\xc2\xa03d 964, 966\xe2\x80\x93975, 977 (CA10 2006).  The lower courts concluded that these offenses were crimes \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[d] conduct that present[ed] a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not hold that the maximum term of imprisonment that petitioner faced on his felony DUI convictions was less than one year.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Nor does the Court dispute that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s offenses involved \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The only remaining question, therefore, is whether the risk presented by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s qualifying DUI felony convictions was \xe2\x80\x9cserious,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9csignificant\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimportant.\xe2\x80\x9d See, <em>e.g</em>., Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 2073 (hereinafter Webster\xe2\x80\x99s); (2002) 15 Oxford English Dictionary 15 (def. 6(a)) (2d ed. 1989) (hereinafter OED).  In my view, it was.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Statistics dramatically show that driving under the influence of alcohol is very dangerous.  Each year, approximately 15,000 fatal alcohol-related crashes occur, accounting for roughly 40% of all fatal crashes.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] Approximately a quarter million people are injured annually in alcohol-related crashes.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The number of people who are killed each year by drunk drivers is far greater than the number of murders committed during any of the crimes specifically set out in the statutory provision at issue here, \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii)\xe2\x80\x94burglary, arson, extortion, and offenses involving the use of explosives.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s qualifying offenses, moreover, fell within the statute only because he had been convicted of DUI on at least three prior occasions.  As noted, petitioner had <em>a dozen</em> prior DUI convictions.  Persons who repeatedly drive drunk present a greatly enhanced danger that they and others will be injured as a result.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In addition, it has been estimated that the ratio of DUI incidents to DUI arrests is between 250 to 1 and 2,000 to 1.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] Accordingly, the risk presented by a 10th, 11th, and 12th DUI conviction may be viewed as the risk created by literally thousands of drunk-driving events.  That risk was surely \xe2\x80\x9cserious,\xe2\x80\x9d and therefore petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s offenses fell squarely within the language of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, taking the statutory language to mean what it says would not sweep in all DUI convictions.  Most DUI convictions are not punishable by a term of imprisonment of more than one year and thus fall outside the scope of the statute.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s convictions qualified only because of his extraordinary\xe2\x80\x94and, I would say, extraordinarily dangerous\xe2\x80\x94record of drunk driving.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court holds that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it is \xe2\x80\x9croughly similar, in kind as well as in degree of risked posed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 5, to the crimes specifically listed in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), <em>i.e.,</em> burglary, extortion, arson, and crimes involving the use of explosives.  These crimes, according to the Court, \xe2\x80\x9call typically involve purposeful, \xe2\x80\x98violent,\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98aggressive\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7 (quoting 470 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 980 (McConnell, J., dissenting)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interpretation cannot be squared with the text of the statute, which simply does not provide that an offense must be \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cviolent,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d in order to fall within the residual clause.  Rather, after listing burglary, arson, extortion, and explosives offenses, the statute provides (in the residual clause) that an offense qualifies if it \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Therefore, offenses falling within the residual clause must be similar to the named offenses in one respect only: They must, \xe2\x80\x9cotherwise\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, \xe2\x80\x9cin a different manner,\xe2\x80\x9d 10 OED 984 (def. B(1)); see also Webster\xe2\x80\x99s 1598\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[] conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  Requiring that an offense must also be \xe2\x80\x9cpurposeful,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cviolent,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d amounts to adding new elements to the statute, but we \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily resist reading words or elements into a statute that do not appear on its face.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bates</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/23/index.html">522 U. S. 23</a>, 29 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each part of this additional, judicially added requirement presents other problems as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Purposeful.  </em>At least one State\xe2\x80\x99s DUI law requires proof of purposeful conduct.  See <em>Tam</em> v. <em>State</em>, 232 Ga. App. 15, ___, 501 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 51, 52 (1998) (requiring proof of the intent to drive).  In addition, many States recognize involuntary intoxication as a defense.  See 4 R. Essen &amp; R. Erwin, Defense of Drunk Driving Cases: Criminal\xe2\x80\x94Civil \xc2\xa744.04 (2007).  And even in States that do not require purposefulness, I have no doubt that the overwhelming majority of DUI defendants purposefully drank before getting behind the wheel and were purposefully operating their vehicles at the time of apprehension.  I suspect that many DUI statutes do not require proof of purposefulness because the element is almost always present, requiring proof of the element would introduce an unnecessary complication, and it would make no sense to preclude conviction of those defendants who were so drunk that they did not even realize that they were behind the wheel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Violent.  </em>It is clear that 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) is not limited to \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d crimes, for if it were, it would be redundant.  The prior subparagraph, \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(A), includes offenses that have as an element the use or threatened use of violence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Aggressive.  </em>The concept of \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d crimes is vague, and in any event, it is hardly apparent why DUI\xe2\x80\x94not to mention the species of felony DUI recidivism that resulted in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s predicament\xe2\x80\x94is not \xe2\x80\x9caggressive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Driving can certainly involve \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d conduct.  Indeed, some States have created the offense of \xe2\x80\x9caggressive driving.\xe2\x80\x9d  See M. Savage, M. Sundeen, &amp; A. Teigen, Traffic Safety and Public Health: State Legislative Action 2007, Transportation Series (National Conference of State Legislatures, Dec. 2007, No. 32), p.\xc2\xa017, and App. J, online\nat http://www.ncsl.org/print/transportation/07trafficsafety.\npdf.  Most States have a toll-free telephone number to call to report \xe2\x80\x9caggressive\xe2\x80\x9d driving.  See Campaign Safe &amp; Sober, Phone Numbers for Reporting Impaired, Aggressive, or Unsafe Driving, online at http://www.nhtsa.dot.\ngov/people/outreach/safesobr/16qp/phone.html.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court defends its new statutory element on the ground that a defendant who merely engages in felony drunk driving is not likely to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of person who might deliberately point the gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  The Court cites no empirical support for this conclusion, and its accuracy is not self-evident.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s pattern of behavior may or may not be typical of those defendants who have enough DUI convictions to qualify under N.\xc2\xa0M. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa766\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x93102(G) and 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B), but the example of his behavior in this case\xe2\x80\x94pointing a gun at his aunt\xe2\x80\x99s head and repeatedly pulling the trigger\xe2\x80\x94should surely be enough to counsel against uncritical reliance on stereotypes about \xe2\x80\x9cthe type\xe2\x80\x9d of people who commit felony DUI violations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Defendants who qualify for an enhanced sentence under \xc2\xa7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. V) based (in whole or in part) on felony DUI convictions share at least three characteristics that are relevant for present purposes.  First, they are persons who, in the judgment of Congress, cannot be trusted to use a firearm responsibly.  In order to qualify for an enhanced sentence under \xc2\xa7924(e), a defendant must of course be convicted of violating the felon-in-possession statute, \xc2\xa7922(g) (2000 ed.).  The felon-in-possession statute necessarily rests on the judgment that a person with a prior felony conviction cannot be trusted with a firearm.  See<em> Caron </em>v.<em> United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/308/index.html">524 U. S. 308</a>, 315 (1998) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress meant to keep guns away from all offenders who, the Federal Government feared, might cause harm \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  And there is no dispute that a prior felony DUI conviction qualifies as a felony under the felon-in-possession law.  If Congress thought that a person with a prior felony DUI conviction is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of person\xe2\x80\x9d who is likely to use a gun unlawfully, why would Congress have made it a crime for such a person to possess a gun?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) are likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems.  As previously mentioned, ordinary DUI convictions are generally not counted under \xc2\xa7924(e) because they are not punishable by imprisonment for more than a year.  Such penalties are generally reserved for persons, like petitioner, with a record of repeated DUI violations.  See<em> </em>National Conference of State Legislatures, <em>supra</em>.<em> </em>Such individuals are very likely to have serious alcohol abuse problems and a propensity to engage in irresponsible conduct while under the influence.  Alcohol use often precedes violent crimes, see,<em> e.g.</em>, Roizen, Epidemiological Issues in Alcohol-Related Violence, in 13 Recent Developments in Alcoholism 7, 8\xe2\x80\x939 (M. Galanter ed. 1997), and thus there is reason to worry about the misuse of firearms by defendants whose alcohol abuse problems are serious enough to result in felony DUI\nconvictions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, defendants with DUI convictions that are counted under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B) have either (a) such serious alcohol abuse problems that they have at least three prior felony DUI convictions or (b) both one or two felony DUI convictions and one or two offenses that fall under \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(i) (offenses that have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force\xe2\x80\x9d) or that are specifically set out in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) (burglary, arson, extortion, or an explosives offense).  Defendants with three felony DUI convictions are likely to be super\xe2\x80\x93DUI-recidivists like petitioner.  Defendants with a combination of felony DUI and other qualifying convictions\xe2\x80\x94for example, convictions for assault or burglary\xe2\x80\x94are persons who, even by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lights, could be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of person who might deliberately point [a] gun and pull the trigger.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the Court, I cannot say that persons with these characteristics are less likely to use a gun illegally than are persons convicted of other qualifying felonies.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence takes a different approach, but his analysis is likewise flawed.  Justice Scalia would hold (a) that an offense does not fall within the residual clause unless it presents a risk that is at least as great as that presented by the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (b) that burglary is the least dangerous of the enumerated offenses; (c) that the relevant measure of risk is the risk that the typical burglary, DUI, etc. would result in injury; and (d) that the risk presented by an incident of DUI is less than the risk presented by a burglary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia, like the Court, does not follow the statutory language.  The statute says that offenses falling within the residual clause must present \xe2\x80\x9ca serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  The statute does not say that these offenses must present at least as much risk as the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute also does not say, as Justice Scalia would hold, that the relevant risk is the risk that each incident of DUI will result in injury.  I see no basis for concluding that Congress was not also concerned with the risk faced by potential victims, particularly since the statute explicitly refers to \xe2\x80\x9cpotential risk.\xe2\x80\x9d  Drunk driving is regarded as a severe societal problem in large measure because of the very large number of victims it produces each year.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses is based on a procrustean reading of \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii).  This provision refers, without qualification, to \xe2\x80\x9cextortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  In his dissent in <em>James</em> v. <em>United States,</em> 550 U. S. ___ (2007), Justice Scalia concluded that many forms of extortion are \xe2\x80\x9cinherently <em>unlikely</em> to cause physical harm.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at ___ (slip op., at 10) (emphasis in original).  Only by finding that the term \xe2\x80\x9cextortion\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7924(e)(2)(B)(ii) really means only certain forms of extortion was Justice Scalia able to come to the conclusion that burglary is the least risky of the enumerated offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For all these reasons, I would affirm the decision of the Tenth Circuit.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>United States </em>v. <em>Gonzaga Rodriquez</em>, now pending before the Court, presents the question \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether a state drug-trafficking offense, for which state law authorized a ten-year sentence because the defendant was a recidivist, qualifies as a predicate offense under the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.
