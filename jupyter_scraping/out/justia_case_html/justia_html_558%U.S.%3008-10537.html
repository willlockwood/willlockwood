MCCOLLUM<br/>\n558 U. S. ____ (2009)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">GEORGE PORTER, Jr. <em>v.</em> BILL McCOLLUM,\nATTORNEY GENERAL OF FLORIDA, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united\nstates court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 08\xe2\x80\x9310537.\xe2\x80\x83Decided November 30, 2009</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner George Porter is a veteran who was both wounded and decorated for his active participation in two major engagements during the Korean War; his combat service unfortunately left him a traumatized, changed man.  His commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s moving description of those two battles was only a fraction of the mitigating evidence that his counsel failed to discover or present during the penalty phase of his trial in 1988.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this federal postconviction proceeding, the District Court held that Porter\xe2\x80\x99s lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s failure to adduce that evidence violated his Sixth Amendment right to counsel and granted his application for a writ of habeas corpus.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, on the ground that the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Porter was not prejudiced by any deficient performance by his counsel was a reasonable application of <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  Like the District Court, we are persuaded that it was objectively unreasonable to conclude there was no reasonable probability the sentence would have been different if the sentencing judge and jury had heard the significant mitigation evidence that Porter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel neither uncovered nor presented.  We therefore grant the petition for certiorari in part and reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Porter was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder for the shooting of his former girlfriend, Evelyn Williams, and her boyfriend Walter Burrows.  He was sentenced to death on the first count but not the second.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In July 1986, as his relationship with Williams was ending, Porter threatened to kill her and then left town.  When he returned to Florida three months later, he attempted to see Williams but her mother told him that Williams did not want to see him.  He drove past Williams\xe2\x80\x99 house each of the two days prior to the shooting, and the night before the murder he visited Williams, who called the police.  Porter then went to two cocktail lounges and spent the night with a friend, who testified Porter was quite drunk by 11 p.m.  Early the next morning, Porter shot Williams in her house.  Burrows struggled with Porter and forced him outside where Porter shot him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Porter represented himself, with standby counsel, for most of the pretrial proceedings and during the beginning of his trial.  Near the completion of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case in chief, Porter pleaded guilty.  He thereafter changed his mind about representing himself, and his standby counsel was appointed as his counsel for the penalty phase.  During the penalty phase, the State attempted to prove four aggravating factors: Porter had been \xe2\x80\x9cpreviously convicted\xe2\x80\x9d of another violent felony (<em>i.e.</em>, in Williams\xe2\x80\x99 case, killing Burrows, and in his case, killing Williams);[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the murder was committed during a burglary; the murder was committed in a cold, calculated, and premeditated manner; and the murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel.  The defense put on only one witness, Porter\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife, and read an excerpt from a deposition.  The sum total of the mitigating evidence was inconsistent testimony about Porter\xe2\x80\x99s behavior when intoxicated and testimony that Porter had a good relationship with his son.  Although his lawyer told the jury that Porter \xe2\x80\x9chas other handicaps that weren\xe2\x80\x99t apparent during the trial\xe2\x80\x9d and Porter was not \xe2\x80\x9cmentally healthy,\xe2\x80\x9d he did not put on any evidence related to Porter\xe2\x80\x99s mental health.  3 Tr. 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (Jan. 22, 1988).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury recommended the death sentence for both murders.  The trial court found that the State had proved all four aggravating circumstances for the murder of Williams but that only the first two were established with respect to Burrows\xe2\x80\x99 murder.  The trial court found no mitigating circumstances and imposed a death sentence for Williams\xe2\x80\x99 murder only.  On direct appeal, the Florida Supreme Court affirmed the sentence over the dissent of two justices, but struck the heinous, atrocious, or cruel aggravating factor.  <em>Porter</em> v. <em>State</em>, 564 So.\xc2\xa02d 1060 (1990) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The court found the State had not carried its burden on that factor because the \xe2\x80\x9crecord is consistent with the hypothesis that Porter\xe2\x80\x99s was a crime of passion, not a crime that was meant to be deliberately and extraordinarily painful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1063 (emphasis deleted).  The two dissenting justices would have reversed the penalty because the evidence of drunkenness, \xe2\x80\x9ccombined with evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s emotionally charged, desperate, frustrated desire to meet with his former lover, is sufficient to render the death penalty disproportional punishment in this instance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1065\xe2\x80\x931066 (Barkett, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995, Porter filed a petition for postconviction relief in state court, claiming his penalty-phase counsel failed to investigate and present mitigating evidence.  The court conducted a 2-day evidentiary hearing, during which Porter presented extensive mitigating evidence, all of which was apparently unknown to his penalty-phase counsel.  Unlike the evidence presented during Porter\xe2\x80\x99s penalty hearing, which left the jury knowing hardly anything about him other than the facts of his crimes, the new evidence described his abusive childhood, his heroic military service and the trauma he suffered because of it, his long-term substance abuse, and his impaired mental health and mental capacity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The depositions of his brother and sister described the abuse Porter suffered as a child.  Porter routinely witnessed his father beat his mother, one time so severely that she had to go to the hospital and lost a child.  Porter\xe2\x80\x99s father was violent every weekend, and by his siblings\xe2\x80\x99 account, Porter was his father\xe2\x80\x99s favorite target, particularly when Porter tried to protect his mother.  On one occasion, Porter\xe2\x80\x99s father shot at him for coming home late, but missed and just beat Porter instead.  According to his brother, Porter attended classes for slow learners and left school when he was 12 or 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To escape his horrible family life, Porter enlisted in the Army at age 17 and fought in the Korean War.  His company commander, Lieutenant Colonel Sherman Pratt, testified at Porter\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction hearing.  Porter was with the 2d Division, which had advanced above the 38th parallel to Kunu-ri when it was attacked by Chinese forces.  Porter suffered a gunshot wound to the leg during the advance but was with the unit for the battle at Kunu-ri.  While the Eighth Army was withdrawing, the 2d Division was ordered to hold off the Chinese advance, enabling the bulk of the Eighth Army to live to fight another day.  As Colonel Pratt described it, the unit \xe2\x80\x9cwent into position there in bitter cold night, terribly worn out, terribly weary, almost like zombies because we had been in constant\xe2\x80\x94for five days we had been in constant contact with the enemy fighting our way to the rear, little or no sleep, little or no food, literally as I say zombies.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Tr. 138 (Jan. 4, 1996).  The next morning, the unit engaged in a \xe2\x80\x9cfierce hand-to-hand fight with the Chinese\xe2\x80\x9d and later that day received permission to withdraw, making Porter\xe2\x80\x99s regiment the last unit of the Eighth Army to withdraw.  <em>Id</em>., at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Less than three months later, Porter fought in a second battle, at Chip\xe2\x80\x99yong-ni.  His regiment was cut off from the rest of the Eighth Army and defended itself for two days and two nights under constant fire.  After the enemy broke through the perimeter and overtook defensive positions on high ground, Porter\xe2\x80\x99s company was charged with retaking those positions.  In the charge up the hill, the soldiers \xe2\x80\x9cwere under direct open fire of the enemy forces on top of the hill.  They immediately came under mortar, artillery, machine gun, and every other kind of fire you can imagine and they were just dropping like flies as they went along.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 150.  Porter\xe2\x80\x99s company lost all three of its platoon sergeants, and almost all of the officers were wounded.  Porter was again wounded and his company sustained the heaviest losses of any troops in the battle, with more than 50% casualties.  Colonel Pratt testified that these battles were \xe2\x80\x9cvery trying, horrifying experiences,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly for Porter\xe2\x80\x99s company at Chip\xe2\x80\x99yong-ni.  <em>Id</em>., at 152.  Porter\xe2\x80\x99s unit was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for the engagement at Chip\xe2\x80\x99yong-ni, and Porter individually received two Purple Hearts and the Combat Infantryman Badge, along with other decorations.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Colonel Pratt testified that Porter went absent without leave (AWOL) for two periods while in Korea.  He explained that this was not uncommon, as soldiers sometimes became disoriented and separated from the unit, and that the commander had decided not to impose any punishment for the absences.  In Colonel Pratt\xe2\x80\x99s experience, an \xe2\x80\x9cawful lot of [veterans] come back nervous wrecks.  Our [veterans\xe2\x80\x99] hospitals today are filled with people mentally trying to survive the perils and hardships [of] \xe2\x80\xa6 the Korean War,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly those who fought in the battles he described.  <em>Id</em>., at 153.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Porter returned to the United States, he went AWOL for an extended period of time.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  He was sentenced to six months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment for that infraction, but he received an honorable discharge.  After his discharge, he suffered dreadful nightmares and would attempt to climb his bedroom walls with knives at night.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Porter\xe2\x80\x99s family eventually removed all of the knives from the house.  According to Porter\xe2\x80\x99s brother, Porter developed a serious drinking problem and began drinking so heavily that he would get into fights and not remember them at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to this testimony regarding his life history, Porter presented an expert in neuropsychology, Dr. Dee, who had examined Porter and administered a number of psychological assessments.  Dr. Dee concluded that Porter suffered from brain damage that could manifest in impulsive, violent behavior.  At the time of the crime, Dr. Dee testified, Porter was substantially impaired in his ability to conform his conduct to the law and suffered from an extreme mental or emotional disturbance, two statutory mitigating circumstances, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(6).  Dr. Dee also testified that Porter had substantial difficulties with reading, writing, and memory, and that these cognitive defects were present when he was evaluated for competency to stand trial.  2 Tr. 227\xe2\x80\x93228 (Jan. 5, 1996); see also Record 904\xe2\x80\x93906.  Although the State\xe2\x80\x99s experts reached different conclusions regarding the statutory mitigators,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] each expert testified that he could not diagnose Porter or rule out a brain abnormality.  2 Tr. 345, 382 (Jan. 5, 1996); 3 <em>id</em>., at 405.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The trial judge who conducted the state postconviction hearing, without determining counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency, held that Porter had not been prejudiced by the failure to introduce any of that evidence.  Record 1203, 1206<em>.</em>  He found that Porter had failed to establish any statutory mitigating circumstances, <em>id.</em>, at 1207, and that the nonstatutory mitigating evidence would not have made a difference in the outcome of the case, <em>id.</em>, at 1210.  He discounted the evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s alcohol abuse because it was inconsistent and discounted the evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s abusive childhood because he was 54 years old at the time of the trial.  He also concluded that Porter\xe2\x80\x99s periods of being AWOL would have reduced the impact of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s military service to \xe2\x80\x9cinconsequential proportions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1212.  Finally, he held that even considering all three categories of evidence together, the \xe2\x80\x9ctrial judge and jury still would have imposed death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1214.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court affirmed.  It first accepted the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that Porter could not have established any statutory mitigating circumstances, based on the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the State\xe2\x80\x99s experts\xe2\x80\x99 conclusions in that regard.  <em>Porter</em> v. <em>State</em>, 788 So.\xc2\xa02d 917, 923 (2001) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  It then held the trial court was correct to find \xe2\x80\x9cthe additional nonstatutory mitigation to be lacking in weight because of the specific facts presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 925.  Like the postconviction court, the Florida Supreme Court reserved judgment regarding counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency.  <em>Ibid.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</em>  Two justices dissented, reasoning that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to investigate and present mitigating evidence was \xe2\x80\x9cespecially harmful\xe2\x80\x9d because of the divided vote affirming the sentence on direct appeal\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ceven without the substantial mitigation that we now know existed\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and because of the reversal of the heinous, atrocious, and cruel aggravating factor.  <em>Id.</em>, at 937 (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Porter thereafter filed his federal habeas petition.  The District Court held Porter\xe2\x80\x99s penalty-phase counsel had been ineffective.  It first determined that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance had been deficient because \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty-phase counsel did little, if any investigation \xe2\x80\xa6 and failed to effectively advocate on behalf of his client before the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Porter</em> v. <em>Crosby</em>, No. 6:03\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x931465\xe2\x80\x93Orl\xe2\x80\x9331KRS, 2007 WL 1747316, *23 (MD Fla., June 18, 2007).  It then determined that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance was prejudicial, finding that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was contrary to clearly established law in part because the state court failed to consider the entirety of the evidence when reweighing the evidence in mitigation, including the trial evidence suggesting that \xe2\x80\x9cthis was a crime of passion, that [Porter] was drinking heavily just hours before the murders, or that [Porter] had a good relationship with his son.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at *30.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Eleventh Circuit reversed.  It held the District Court had failed to appropriately defer to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings with respect to Porter\xe2\x80\x99s alcohol abuse and his mental health.  552 F.\xc2\xa03d 1260, 1274, 1275 (2008) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The Court of Appeals then separately considered each category of mitigating evidence and held it was not unreasonable for the state court to discount each category as it did.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1274.  Porter petitioned for a writ of certiorari.  We grant the petition and reverse with respect to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 disposition of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective- assistance claim.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To prevail under <em>Strickland</em>, Porter must show that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance prejudiced him.  To establish deficiency, Porter must show his \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 688.  To establish prejudice, he \xe2\x80\x9cmust show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 694.  Finally, Porter is entitled to relief only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strickland</em>, or it rested \xe2\x80\x9con an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the state court did not decide whether Porter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel was deficient, we review this element of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Strickland</em> claim <em>de novo</em>.  <em>Rompilla</em> v. <em>Beard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/374/index.html">545 U. S. 374</a>, 390 (2005).  It is unquestioned that under the prevailing professional norms at the time of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s trial, counsel had an \xe2\x80\x9cobligation to conduct a thorough investigation of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 396 (2000).  The investigation conducted by Porter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel clearly did not satisfy those norms.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although Porter had initially elected to represent himself, his standby counsel became his counsel for the penalty phase a little over a month prior to the sentencing proceeding before the jury.  It was the first time this lawyer had represented a defendant during a penalty-phase proceeding.  At the postconviction hearing, he testified that he had only one short meeting with Porter regarding the penalty phase.  He did not obtain any of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s school, medical, or military service records or interview any members of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s family.  In <em>Wiggins</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/510/index.html">539 U. S. 510</a>, 524, 525 (2003), we held counsel \xe2\x80\x9cfell short of \xe2\x80\xa6 professional standards\xe2\x80\x9d for not expanding their investigation beyond the presentence investigation report and one set of records they obtained, particularly \xe2\x80\x9cin light of what counsel actually discovered\xe2\x80\x9d in the records.  Here, counsel did not even take the first step of interviewing witnesses or requesting records.  Cf. <em>Bobby</em> v. <em>Van Hook</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938 (holding performance not deficient when counsel gathered a substantial amount  of information and then made a reasonable decision not to pursue additional sources); <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 699 (\xe2\x80\x9c[Counsel\xe2\x80\x99s] decision not to seek more character or psychological evidence than was already in hand was \xe2\x80\xa6 reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Beyond that, like the counsel in <em>Wiggins</em>, he ignored pertinent avenues for investigation of which he should have been aware.  The court-ordered competency evaluations, for example, collectively reported Porter\xe2\x80\x99s very few years of regular school, his military service and wounds sustained in combat, and his father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cover-disciplin[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 902\xe2\x80\x93906.  As an explanation, counsel described Porter as fatalistic and uncooperative.  But he acknowledged that although Porter instructed him not to speak with Porter\xe2\x80\x99s ex-wife or son, Porter did not give him any other instructions limiting the witnesses he could interview.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Counsel thus failed to uncover and present any evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s mental health or mental impairment, his family background, or his military service.  The decision not to investigate did not reflect reasonable professional judgment.  <em>Wiggins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 534.  Porter may have been fatalistic or uncooperative, but that does not obviate the need for defense counsel to conduct <em>some</em> sort of mitigation investigation.  See <em>Rompilla</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 381\xe2\x80\x93382.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we find Porter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel deficient, we must determine whether the Florida Supreme Court unreasonably applied <em>Strickland </em>in holding Porter was not prejudiced by that deficiency.  Under <em>Strickland</em>, a defendant is prejudiced by his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient performance if \xe2\x80\x9cthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U. S., at 694.  In Florida, the sentencing judge makes the determination as to the existence and weight of aggravating and mitigating circumstances and the punishment, Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(3), but he must give the jury verdict of life or death \xe2\x80\x9cgreat weight,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Tedder</em> v. <em>State</em>, 322 So.\xc2\xa02d 908, 910 (Fla. 1975) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Porter must show that but for his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency, there is a reasonable probability he would have received a different sentence.  To assess that probability, we consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe totality of the available mitigation evidence\xe2\x80\x94both that adduced at trial, and the evidence adduced in the habeas proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and \xe2\x80\x9creweig[h] it against the evidence in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 397\xe2\x80\x93398.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is not a case in which the new evidence \xe2\x80\x9cwould barely have altered the sentencing profile presented to the sentencing judge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 700.  The judge and jury at Porter\xe2\x80\x99s original sentencing heard almost nothing that would humanize Porter or allow them to accurately gauge his moral culpability.  They learned about Porter\xe2\x80\x99s turbulent relationship with Williams, his crimes, and almost nothing else.  Had Porter\xe2\x80\x99s counsel been effective, the judge and jury would have learned of the \xe2\x80\x9ckind of troubled history we have declared relevant to assessing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wiggins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 535.  They would have heard about (1) Porter\xe2\x80\x99s heroic military service in two of the most critical\xe2\x80\x94and horrific\xe2\x80\x94battles of the Korean War, (2) his struggles to regain normality upon his return from war, (3) his childhood history of physical abuse, and (4) his brain abnormality, difficulty reading and writing, and limited schooling.  See <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>, 219 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[E]vidence about the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s background and character is relevant because of the belief, long held by this society, that defendants who commit criminal acts that are attributable to a disadvantaged background \xe2\x80\xa6 may be less culpable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Instead, they heard absolutely none of that evidence, evidence which \xe2\x80\x9cmight well have influenced the jury\xe2\x80\x99s appraisal of [Porter\xe2\x80\x99s] moral culpability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 398.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other side of the ledger, the weight of evidence in aggravation is not as substantial as the sentencing judge thought.  As noted, the sentencing judge accepted the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation of a death sentence for the murder of Williams but rejected the jury\xe2\x80\x99s death-sentence recommendation for the murder of Burrows.  The sentencing judge believed that there were four aggravating circumstances related to the Williams murder but only two for the Burrows murder.  Accordingly, the judge must have reasoned that the two aggravating circumstances that were present in both cases were insufficient to warrant a death sentence but that the two additional aggravating circumstances present with respect to the Williams murder were sufficient to tip the balance in favor of a death sentence.  But the Florida Supreme Court rejected one of these additional aggravating circumstances, <em>i.e.</em>, that Williams\xe2\x80\x99 murder was especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel, finding the murder \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with \xe2\x80\xa6 a crime of passion\xe2\x80\x9d even though premeditated to a heightened degree.  564 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 1063\xe2\x80\x931064.  Had the judge and jury been able to place Porter\xe2\x80\x99s life history \xe2\x80\x9con the mitigating side of the scale,\xe2\x80\x9d and appropriately reduced the ballast on the aggravating side of the scale, there is clearly a reasonable probability that the advisory jury\xe2\x80\x94and the sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwould have struck a different balance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wiggins</em>, 539 U. S., at 537, and it is unreasonable to conclude otherwise.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision that Porter was not prejudiced by his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to conduct a thorough\xe2\x80\x94or even cursory\xe2\x80\x94investigation is unreasonable.  The Florida Supreme Court either did not consider or unreasonably discounted the mitigation evidence adduced in the postconviction hearing.  Under Florida law, mental health evidence that does not rise to the level of establishing a statutory mitigating circumstance may nonetheless be considered by the sentencing judge and jury as mitigating.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hoskins </em>v<em>.</em> <em>State</em>, 965 So.\xc2\xa02d 1, 17\xe2\x80\x9318 (Fla. 2007) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  Indeed, the Constitution requires that \xe2\x80\x9cthe sentencer in capital cases must be permitted to consider any relevant mitigating factor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 112 (1982).  Yet neither the postconviction trial court nor the Florida Supreme Court gave any consideration for the purpose of nonstatutory mitigation to Dr. Dee\xe2\x80\x99s testimony regarding the existence of a brain abnormality and cognitive defects.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  While the State\xe2\x80\x99s experts identified perceived problems with the tests that Dr. Dee used and the conclusions that he drew from them, it was not reasonable to discount entirely the effect that his testimony might have had on the jury or the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Florida Supreme Court, following the state postconviction court, unreasonably discounted the evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s childhood abuse and military service.  It is unreasonable to discount to irrelevance the evidence of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s abusive childhood, especially when that kind of history may have particular salience for a jury evaluating Porter\xe2\x80\x99s behavior in his relationship with Williams.  It is also unreasonable to conclude that Porter\xe2\x80\x99s military service would be reduced to \xe2\x80\x9cinconsequential proportions,\xe2\x80\x9d 788 So.\xc2\xa02d, at 925, simply because the jury would also have learned that Porter went AWOL on more than one occasion.  Our Nation has a long tradition of according leniency to veterans in recognition of their service, especially for those who fought on the front lines as Porter did.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Moreover, the relevance of Porter\xe2\x80\x99s extensive combat experience is not only that he served honorably under extreme hardship and gruesome conditions, but also that the jury might find mitigating the intense stress and mental and emotional toll that combat took on Porter.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The evidence that he was AWOL is consistent with this theory of mitigation and does not impeach or diminish the evidence of his service.  To conclude otherwise reflects a failure to engage with what Porter actually went through in Korea.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the two dissenting justices in the Florida Supreme Court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cthere exists too much mitigating evidence that was not presented to now be ignored.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 937 (Anstead, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Although the burden is on petitioner to show he was prejudiced by his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficiency, the Florida Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Porter failed to meet this burden was an unreasonable application of our clearly established law.  We do not require a defendant to show \xe2\x80\x9cthat counsel\xe2\x80\x99s deficient conduct more likely than not altered the outcome\xe2\x80\x9d of his penalty proceeding, but rather that he establish \xe2\x80\x9ca probability sufficient to undermine confidence in [that] outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 693\xe2\x80\x93694.  This Porter has done.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The petition for certiorari is granted in part, and the motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> is granted.

Stat. \xc2\xa7921.141(5)(b) (1987).
