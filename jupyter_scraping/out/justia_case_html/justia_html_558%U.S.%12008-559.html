S. 307</a> (1979), we held that a state prisoner is entitled to habeas corpus relief if a federal judge finds that \xe2\x80\x9cupon the record evidence adduced at the trial no rational trier of fact could have found proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 324.  A Nevada jury convicted respondent of rape; the evidence presented included DNA evidence matching respondent\xe2\x80\x99s DNA profile.  Nevertheless, relying upon a report prepared by a DNA expert over 11 years after the trial, the Federal District Court applied the <em>Jackson</em> standard and granted the writ.  A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Farwell</em>,<em> </em>525 F.\xc2\xa03d 787 (CA9 2008).  We granted certiorari to consider whether those courts misapplied <em>Jackson.</em>  Because the trial record includes both the DNA evidence and other convincing evidence of guilt, we conclude that they clearly did.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Around 1 a.m. on January 29, 1994, 9-year-old Jane Doe was brutally raped in the bedroom of her trailer.  Respondent Troy Brown was convicted of the crime.  During and since his trial, respondent has steadfastly maintained his innocence.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  He was, however, admittedly intoxicated when the crime occurred, and after he awoke on the following morning he told a friend \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98he wished that he could remember what did go on or what went on.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 309.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Troy and his brother Travis resided near Jane Doe in the same trailer park.  Their brother Trent and his wife Raquel lived in the park as well, in a trailer across the street from Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s.  Both Troy and Trent were acquainted with Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s family; Troy had visited Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s trailer several times.  Jane did not know Travis.  The evening of the attack, Jane\xe2\x80\x99s mother, Pam, took Jane to Raquel and Trent\xe2\x80\x99s trailer to babysit while the three adults went out for about an hour.  Raquel and Trent returned at about 7:30 p.m. and took Jane home at about 9:30 p.m.  Pam stayed out and ended up drinking and playing pool with Troy at a nearby bar called the Peacock Lounge.  Troy knew that Jane and her 4-year-old sister were home alone because he answered the phone at\nthe bar when Jane called for her mother earlier that\nevening.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Troy consumed at least 10 shots of vodka followed by beer chasers, and was so drunk that he vomited on himself while he was walking home after leaving the Peacock at about 12:15 a.m.  Jane called her mother to report the rape at approximately 1 a.m.  Although it would have taken a sober man less than 15 minutes to walk home, Troy did not arrive at his trailer until about 1:30 a.m.  He was wearing dark jeans, a cowboy hat, a black satin jacket, and boots.  Two witnesses saw a man dressed in dark jeans, a cowboy hat, and a black satin jacket stumbling in the road between the two trailers shortly after\n1 a.m.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The bedroom where the rape occurred was dark, and Jane was unable to conclusively identify her assailant.  When asked whom he reminded her of, she mentioned both Troy and his brother Trent.  Several days after the rape, she identified a man she saw on television (Troy) as her assailant but then stated that the man who had sent flowers attacked her.  It was Trent and Raquel who had sent her flowers, not Troy.  She was unable to identify Troy as her assailant out of a photo lineup, and she could not identify her assailant at trial.  The night of the rape, however, she said her attacker was wearing dark jeans, a black jacket with a zipper, boots, and a watch.  She also vividly remembered that the man \xe2\x80\x9cstunk real, real bad\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9ccologne, or some beer or puke or something.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 172\xe2\x80\x93173.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Some evidence besides Jane\xe2\x80\x99s inconsistent identification did not inculpate Troy.  Jane testified that she thought she had bitten her assailant, but Troy did not have any bite marks on his hands when examined by a police officer approximately four hours after the attack.  Jane stated that her assailant\xe2\x80\x99s jacket had a zipper (Troy\xe2\x80\x99s did not) and that he wore a watch (Troy claimed he did not).  Additionally, there was conflicting testimony as to when Troy left the Peacock and when Pam received Jane\xe2\x80\x99s call reporting the rape.  The witnesses who saw a man stumbling between the two trailers reported a bright green logo on the back of the jacket, but Troy\xe2\x80\x99s jacket had a yellow and orange logo.  Finally, because Jane thought she had left a night light on when she went to bed, the police suspected the assailant had turned off the light.  The only usable fingerprint taken from the light did not match Troy\xe2\x80\x99s and the police did not find Troy\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints in the trailer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other physical evidence, however, pointed to Troy.  The police recovered semen from Jane\xe2\x80\x99s underwear and from the rape kit.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Renee Romero, tested the former and determined that the DNA matched Troy\xe2\x80\x99s and that the probability another person from the general population would share the same DNA (the \xe2\x80\x9crandom match probability\xe2\x80\x9d) was only 1 in 3,000,000.  Troy\xe2\x80\x99s counsel did not call his own DNA expert at trial, although he consulted with an expert in advance who found no problems with Romero\xe2\x80\x99s test procedures.  At some time before sentencing, Troy\xe2\x80\x99s family had additional DNA testing done.  That testing showed semen taken from the rape kit matched Troy\xe2\x80\x99s DNA, with a random match probability of 1 in 10,000.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury found Troy guilty of sexual assault and sentenced him to life with the possibility of parole after 10 years.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On direct appeal, the Nevada Supreme Court considered Troy\xe2\x80\x99s claim that his conviction was not supported by sufficient evidence, analyzing \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the jury, acting reasonably, could have been convinced of [Troy\xe2\x80\x99s] guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Nevada</em>, 113 Nev. 275, 285, 934 P.\xc2\xa02d 235, 241 (1997) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The court rejected the claim, summarizing the evidence of guilt as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTestimony indicated that Troy left the bar around 12:15 a.m., that Troy lived relatively close to the bar, and that Troy lived very close to Jane Doe.  Troy had enough time to get from the bar to Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s house and to assault Jane Doe before she made the telephone call to her mother at approximately 1:00 a.m.  While Jane Doe could not identify her assailant, her description of his clothing was similar to what Troy was wearing; she also said that her assailant smelled like beer or vomit and testimony indicated that Troy had been drinking beer and had vomited several times that night.  Furthermore, testimony indicated that Troy got home at approximately 1:30 a.m., which gave him enough time to assault Jane Doe.  Additionally, [witnesses] testified that they saw someone resembling Troy in a black jacket and black hat stumbling in the road near Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s house at 1:05 a.m.  Troy also washed his pants and shirt when he got home, arguably to remove the blood evidence from his clothes.  Finally, the DNA evidence indicated that semen collected from Jane Doe\xe2\x80\x99s underwear matched Troy\xe2\x80\x99s and that only 1 in 3,000,000 other people had matching DNA (the second DNA test indicated that 1 in 10,000 people had matching DNA).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, 934 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 241\xe2\x80\x93242.</p>\n<p align="left">\nRespondent also argued on appeal that the trial court erred in failing to conduct a pretrial hearing to determine whether the DNA evidence was reliable.  The court found respondent had not raised this issue in the trial court and concluded there was no plain error in the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to conduct a hearing.  <em>Id.</em>, at 284, 934 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 241.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2001, respondent sought state postconviction relief, claiming, <em>inter alia,</em> that his trial counsel was constitutionally ineffective for failing to object to the admission of the DNA evidence.  He argued that there were a number of foundational problems with the DNA evidence, and that if trial counsel had objected, the evidence would have been excluded or at least its importance diminished.  He noted that because trial counsel \xe2\x80\x9ctotally failed to challenge the DNA evidence in the case,\xe2\x80\x9d counsel \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to preserve valid issues for appeal.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1101.  The state postconviction court denied relief, <em>id., </em>at 1489\xe2\x80\x931499, and the Nevada Supreme Court affirmed, <em>id., </em>at 1500\xe2\x80\x931506.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent thereafter filed this federal habeas petition, claiming there was insufficient evidence to convict him on the sexual assault charges and that the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of his claim was both contrary to, and an unreasonable application of, <em>Jackson</em>.  He did not bring a typical <em>Jackson </em>claim, however.  Rather than argue that the totality of the evidence admitted against him at trial was constitutionally insufficient, he argued that some of the evidence should be excluded from the <em>Jackson </em>analysis.  In particular, he argued that Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony related to the DNA evidence was inaccurate and unreliable in two primary respects: Romero mischaracterized the random match probability and misstated the probability of a DNA match among his brothers.  Absent that testimony, he contended, there was insufficient evidence to convict him.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In support of his claim regarding the accuracy of Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, respondent submitted a report prepared by Laurence Mueller, a professor in ecology and evolutionary biology (Mueller Report).  The District Court supplemented the record with the Mueller Report, even though it was not presented to any state court, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe thesis of the report was argued during post-conviction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Farwell</em>, No. 3:03\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300712\xe2\x80\x93PMP\xe2\x80\x93VPC, 2006 WL 6181129, *5, n.\xc2\xa02 (Nev., Dec. 14, 2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Relying upon the Mueller Report, the District Court set aside the \xe2\x80\x9cunreliable DNA testimony\xe2\x80\x9d and held that without the DNA evidence \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable doubt would exist in the mind of any rational trier of fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at *7.  The court granted respondent habeas relief on his <em>Jackson</em> claim.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  525 F.\xc2\xa03d 787.  The court held the Nevada Supreme Court had unreasonably applied <em>Jackson</em>.  525 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 798; see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The Court of Appeals first reasoned \xe2\x80\x9cthe admission of Romero\xe2\x80\x99s unreliable and misleading testimony violated Troy\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights,\xe2\x80\x9d so the District Court was correct to exclude it.  525 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797.  It then \xe2\x80\x9cweighed the sufficiency of the remaining evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d including the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccatalogu[e] [of] the numerous inconsistencies that would raise a reasonable doubt as to Troy\xe2\x80\x99s guilt in the mind of any rational juror.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  In light of the \xe2\x80\x9cstark\xe2\x80\x9d conflicts in the evidence and the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession that there was insufficient evidence absent the DNA evidence, the court held it was objectively unreasonable for the Nevada Supreme Court to reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 798.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to consider two questions: the proper standard of review for a <em>Jackson</em> claim on federal habeas, and whether such a claim may rely upon evidence outside the trial record that goes to the reliability of trial evidence.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim has now crystallized into a claim about the import of two specific inaccuracies in the testimony related to the DNA evidence, as indicated by the Mueller Report.  The Mueller Report does not challenge Romero\xe2\x80\x99s qualifications as an expert or the validity of any of the tests that she performed.  Mueller instead contends that Romero committed the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy\xe2\x80\x9d and that she underestimated the probability of a DNA match between respondent and one of his brothers.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy is the assumption that the random match probability is the same as the probability that the defendant was not the source of the DNA sample.  See Nat. Research Council, Comm. on DNA Forensic Science, The Evaluation of Forensic DNA Evidence 133 (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cLet P equal the probability of a match, given the evidence genotype.  The fallacy is to say that P is also the probability that the DNA at the crime scene came from someone other than the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  In other words, if a juror is told the probability a member of the general population would share the same DNA is 1 in 10,000 (random match probability), and he takes that to mean there is only a 1 in 10,000 chance that someone other than the defendant is the source of the DNA found at the crime scene (source probability), then he has succumbed to the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy.  It is further error to equate source probability with probability of guilt, unless there is no explanation other than guilt for a person to be the source of crime-scene DNA.  This faulty reasoning may result in an erroneous statement that, based on a random match probability of 1 in 10,000, there is a .01% chance the defendant is innocent or a 99.99% chance the defendant is guilty.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Mueller Report does not dispute Romero\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that only 1 in 3,000,000 people would have the same DNA profile as the rapist.  Mueller correctly points out, however, that some of Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony\xe2\x80\x94as well as the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s argument\xe2\x80\x94suggested that the evidence also established that there was only a .000033% chance that respondent was innocent.  The State concedes as much.  Brief for Petitioners 54.  For example, the prosecutor argued at closing the jury could be \xe2\x80\x9c99.999967 percent sure\xe2\x80\x9d in this case.  App. 730.  And when the prosecutor asked Romero, in a classic example of erroneously equating source probability with random match probability, whether \xe2\x80\x9cit [would] be fair to say \xe2\x80\xa6 that the chances that the DNA found in the panties\xe2\x80\x94the semen in the panties\xe2\x80\x94and the blood sample, the likelihood that it is not Troy Brown would be .000033,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 460, Romero ultimately agreed that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot inaccurate\xe2\x80\x9d to state it that way, <em>id., </em>at 461\xe2\x80\x93462.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking at Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony as a whole, though, she also indicated that she was merely accepting the mathematical equivalence between 1 in 3,000,000 and the percentage figure.  At the end of the colloquy about percentages, she answered affirmatively the court\xe2\x80\x99s question whether the percentage was \xe2\x80\x9cthe same math just expressed differently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 462.  She pointed out that the probability a brother would match was greater than the random match probability, which also indicated to the jury that the random match probability is not the same as the likelihood that someone other than Troy was the source of the DNA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Mueller Report identifies a second error in Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony: her estimate of the probability that one or more of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s brothers\xe2\x80\x99 DNA would match.  Romero testified there was a 1 in 6,500 (or .02%) probability that one brother would share the same DNA with another.  <em>Id., </em>at 469, 472.  When asked whether \xe2\x80\x9cthat change[s] at all with two brothers,\xe2\x80\x9d she answered no.  <em>Id., </em>at 472.  According to Mueller, Romero\xe2\x80\x99s analysis was misleading in two respects.  First, she used an assumption regarding the parents under which siblings have the lowest chance of matching that is biologically possible, but even under this stingy assumption she reported the chance of two brothers matching (1 in 6,500) as much lower than it is (1 in 1,024 under her assumption).  Second, using the assumptions Mueller finds more appropriate, the probability of a single sibling matching respondent is 1 in 263, the probability that among two brothers one or more would match is 1 in 132, and among four brothers it is 1 in 66.  <em>Id., </em>at 1583.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the two inaccuracies upon which this case turns are testimony equating random match probability with source probability, and an underestimate of the likelihood that one of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s brothers would also match the DNA left at the scene.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we granted certiorari to review respondent\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Jackson </em>claim, the parties now agree that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 resolution of his claim under <em>Jackson </em>was in error.  See Brief for Respondent 2\xe2\x80\x933; Reply Brief for Petitioners 1.  Indeed, respondent argues the Court of Appeals did not decide his case under <em>Jackson</em> at all, but instead resolved the question whether admission of Romero\xe2\x80\x99s inaccurate testimony rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and then applied <em>Jackson</em> to determine whether that error was harmless.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although both petitioners and respondent are now aligned on the same side of the questions presented for our review, the case is not moot because \xe2\x80\x9cthe parties continue to seek different relief\xe2\x80\x9d from this Court.  <em>Pacific Bell Telephone Co.</em> v. <em>linkLine Communications, Inc.</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 6).  Respondent primarily argues that we affirm on his proposed alternative ground or remand to the Ninth Circuit for analysis of his due process claim under the standard for harmless error of <em>Brecht</em> v. <em>Abrahamson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/index.html">507 U. S. 619</a> (1993).  The State, on the other hand, asks us to reverse.  Respondent and one <em>amicus</em> have also suggested that we dismiss the case as improvidently granted, Brief for National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 27\xe2\x80\x9328, but we think prudential concerns favor our review of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 application of <em>Jackson</em>.  Cf. <em>Pacific Bell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 7).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent no longer argues it was proper for the District Court to admit the Mueller Report for the purpose of evaluating his <em>Jackson</em> claim, Brief for Respondent 35, and concedes the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of a <em>Jackson</em> analysis is to determine whether the jury acted in a rational manner in returning a guilty verdict based on the evidence before it, not whether improper evidence violated due process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 2.  There has been no suggestion that the evidence adduced at trial was insufficient to convict unless some of it was excluded.  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s concession thus disposes of his <em>Jackson</em> claim.  The concession is also clearly correct.  An \xe2\x80\x9cappellate court\xe2\x80\x99s reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is in effect a determination that the government\xe2\x80\x99s case against the defendant was so lacking that the trial court should have entered a judgment of acquittal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lockhart</em> v. <em>Nelson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/33/index.html">488 U. S. 33</a>, 39 (1988).  Because reversal for insufficiency of the evidence is equivalent to a judgment of acquittal, such a reversal bars a retrial.  See <em>Burks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/1/index.html">437 U. S. 1</a>, 18 (1978). <em> </em>To \xe2\x80\x9cmake the analogy complete\xe2\x80\x9d between a reversal for insufficiency of the evidence and the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s granting a judgment of acquittal, <em>Lockhart</em>, 488 U. S., at 42, \xe2\x80\x9ca reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted by the trial court,\xe2\x80\x9d regardless whether that evidence was admitted erroneously, <em>id.</em>, at 41.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent therefore correctly concedes that a reviewing court must consider all of the evidence admitted at trial when considering a <em>Jackson</em> claim.  Even if we set that concession aside, however, and assume that the Court of Appeals could have considered the Mueller Report in the context of a <em>Jackson</em> claim, the court made an egregious error in concluding the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s insufficiency-of-the-evidence claim \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved an unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the Court of Appeals could have considered it, the Mueller Report provided no warrant for entirely excluding the DNA evidence or Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony from that court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration.  The Report did not contest that the DNA evidence matched Troy.  That DNA evidence remains powerful inculpatory evidence even though the State concedes Romero overstated its probative value by failing to dispel the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy.  And Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s claim that Romero used faulty assumptions and underestimated the probability of a DNA match between brothers indicates that two experts do not agree with one another, not that Romero\xe2\x80\x99s estimates were unreliable.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that \xe2\x80\x9cthe chance that among four brothers one or more would match is 1 in 66,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 1583, is substantially different from Romero\xe2\x80\x99s estimate of a 1 in 6,500 chance that one brother would match.  But even if Romero\xe2\x80\x99s estimate is wrong, our confidence in the jury verdict is not undermined.  First, the estimate that is more pertinent to this case is 1 in 132\xe2\x80\x94the probability of a match among two brothers\xe2\x80\x94because two of Troy\xe2\x80\x99s four brothers lived in Utah.  Second, although Jane Doe mentioned Trent as her assailant, and Travis lived in a nearby trailer, the evidence indicates that both (unlike Troy) were sober and went to bed early on the night of the crime.  Even under Mueller\xe2\x80\x99s odds, a rational jury could consider the DNA evidence to be powerful evidence of guilt.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 discussion of the non-DNA evidence departed from the deferential review that <em>Jackson</em> and \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) demand.  A federal habeas court can only set aside a state-court decision as \xe2\x80\x9can unreasonable application of \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of that law is \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 409 (2000).  And <em>Jackson</em> requires a reviewing court to review the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cin the light most favorable to the prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  443 U. S., at 319.  Expressed more fully, this means a reviewing court \xe2\x80\x9cfaced with a record of historical facts that supports conflicting inferences must presume\xe2\x80\x94even if it does not affirmatively appear in the record\xe2\x80\x94that the trier of fact resolved any such conflicts in favor of the prosecution, and must defer to that resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 326; see also <em>Schlup</em> v. <em>Delo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/298/index.html">513 U. S. 298</a>, 330 (1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>Jackson </em>standard \xe2\x80\xa6 looks to whether there is sufficient evidence which, if credited, could support the conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court of Appeals acknowledged that it must review the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, but the court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of inconsistencies in the testimony shows it failed to do that.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the court highlights conflicting testimony regarding when Troy left the Peacock.  525 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797.  It is true that if a juror were to accept the testimony of one bartender that Troy left the bar at 1:30 a.m., then Troy would have left the bar after the attack occurred.  Yet the jury could have credited a different bartender\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that Troy left the Peacock at around 12:15 a.m.  Resolving the conflict in favor of the prosecution, the jury must have found that Troy left the bar in time to be the assailant.  It is undisputed that Troy washed his clothes immediately upon returning home.  The court notes this is \xe2\x80\x9cplausibly consistent with him being the assailant\xe2\x80\x9d but also that he provided an alternative reason for washing his clothes.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Viewed in the light most favorable to the prosecution, the evidence supports an inference that Troy washed the clothes immediately to clean blood from them.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Jackson</em> analysis relied substantially upon a concession made by the State in state postconviction proceedings that \xe2\x80\x9cabsent the DNA findings, there was insufficient evidence to convict [Troy] of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1180.  But that concession posited a situation in which there was no DNA evidence at all,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] not a situation in which some pieces of testimony regarding the DNA evidence were called into question.  In sum, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis failed to preserve \xe2\x80\x9cthe factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s role as weigher of the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d by reviewing \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all of the evidence</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 in the light most favorable to the prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 319, and it further erred in finding that the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the <em>Jackson</em> claim was objectively unreasonable.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Resolution of the <em>Jackson</em> claim does not end our consideration of this case because respondent asks us to affirm on an alternative ground.  He contends the two errors \xe2\x80\x9cin describing the statistical meaning\xe2\x80\x9d of the DNA evidence rendered his trial fundamentally unfair and denied him due process of law.  Brief for Respondent 4.  Because the Ninth Circuit held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe admission of Romero\xe2\x80\x99s unreliable and misleading testimony violated [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] due process rights,\xe2\x80\x9d 525 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797, and in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s view merely applied <em>Jackson</em> (erroneously) to determine whether that error was harmless, he asks us to affirm the judgment below on the basis of what he calls his \xe2\x80\x9cDNA due process\xe2\x80\x9d claim, Brief for Respondent 35.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As respondent acknowledges, in order to prevail on this claim, he would have to show that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of the claim was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  The clearly established law he points us to is <em>Manson</em> v. <em>Brathwaite</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/98/index.html"></a><a href="/us/432/98/index.html">432 U.

Respondent argues that the admission of the inaccurate DNA testimony violated <em>Brathwaite</em> because the testimony was \xe2\x80\x9cidentification testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d 432 U.

Respondent did not present his new \xe2\x80\x9cDNA due process\xe2\x80\x9d claim in his federal habeas petition, but instead consistently argued that Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony should be excluded from the <em>Jackson</em> analysis simply because it was \xe2\x80\x9cunreliable\xe2\x80\x9d and that the due process violation occurred because the remaining evidence was insufficient to convict.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 157a (\xe2\x80\x9c[Respondent] asserts \xe2\x80\xa6 that the DNA evidence was unreliable and should not have been admitted at his trial.  If so, then, \xe2\x80\xa6 the state presented insufficient evidence at trial to prove [respondent] guilty\xe2\x80\x9d).  In the Ninth Circuit, too, respondent presented only his <em>Jackson</em> claim,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and it is, at the least, unclear whether respondent presented his newly minted due process claim in the state courts.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Recognizing that his <em>Jackson</em> claim cannot prevail, respondent tries to rewrite his federal habeas petition.  His attempt comes too late, however, and he cannot now start over.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have stated before that \xe2\x80\x9cDNA testing can provide powerful new evidence unlike anything known before.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>District Attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Office for Third Judicial Dist.</em> v. <em>Osborne</em>, 557 U.

The State acknowledges that Romero committed the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s fallacy, Brief for Petitioners 54, and the Mueller Report suggests that Romero\xe2\x80\x99s testimony may have been inaccurate regarding the likelihood of a match with one of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s brothers.  Regardless, ample DNA and non-DNA evidence in the record adduced at trial supported the jury\xe2\x80\x99s guilty verdict under <em>Jackson</em>, and we reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s last minute attempt to recast his claim under <em>Brathwaite</em>.  The Court of Appeals did not consider, however, the ineffective-assistance claims on which the District Court also granted respondent habeas relief.

The Court of Appeals held the Nevada Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Jackson</em> because the Nevada court stated a standard that turns on a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d jury, not a \xe2\x80\x9crational\xe2\x80\x9d one, and that assesses whether the jury could have been convinced of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, rather than whether it could have been convinced of each element of the crime.  <em>Brown </em>v. <em>Farwell, </em>525 F.\xc2\xa03d 787, 794\xe2\x80\x93795 (CA9 2008).

But that decision was inextricably intertwined with the claim respondent did make in his federal habeas petition under <em>Jackson</em>.  It is clear the Ninth Circuit was never asked to consider\xe2\x80\x94and did not pass upon\xe2\x80\x94the question whether the Nevada Supreme Court entered a decision on direct appeal that was contrary to or an unreasonable application of <em>Manson</em> v. <em>Brathwaite, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/98/index.html"></a><a href="/us/432/98/index.html">432 U.
