S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(a).  If a tax is properly so assessed, the statute of limitations for collecting it is extended by 10 years from the assessment date.  \xc2\xa76502(a).  Respondents were general partners of a partnership (hereinafter Partnership) that failed to pay significant federal employment taxes from 1992 to 1995.  The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) timely assessed the Partnership, but the taxes were never paid.  Respondents later filed for Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection, and the IRS then filed proof of claims against them for the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s unpaid employment taxes.  Respondents objected, arguing that the timely assessment of the Partnership did not extend the 3-year limitations period against the general partners, who had not been separately assessed within that period.  The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents\xe2\x80\x99 objections.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that since respondents are \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77701, which defines \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany person subject to any internal revenue tax,\xe2\x80\x9d they are also \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76203 and 6501.  As such, the court held that the assessment against the Partnership extended the limitations period only with respect to the Partnership.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The proper tax assessment against the Partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s debts.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that a valid assessment triggering the 10-year increase in the limitations period must name them individually, as they are primarily liable for the tax debt.  They claim, first, that they are the relevant taxpayers under \xc2\xa76203, which requires the assessment to be made by \xe2\x80\x9crecording the liability of the taxpayer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although the Ninth Circuit correctly concluded that an individual partner can be a \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa76203 speaks of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cliability,\xe2\x80\x9d which indicates that the relevant taxpayer must be determined.  Here, the liability arose from the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with \xc2\xa73402(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that an \xe2\x80\x9cemployer [paying] wages\xe2\x80\x9d deduct and withhold employment taxes.  And \xc2\xa73403 makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d that fails to withhold and submit the requisite employment taxes is the \xe2\x80\x9cliable\xe2\x80\x9d taxpayer.  In this case, the Partnership is the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Second, respondents claim that they are primarily liable for the tax debt because California law makes them jointly and severally liable for the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s debts.  However, to be primarily liable for this debt, respondents must show that they are the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  And, under California law, a partnership and its general partners are separate entities.  Thus respondents cannot argue that, for all intents and purposes, imposing a tax directly on the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly on the general partners, but must instead prove that the tax liability was imposed both on the Partnership and on respondents as separate \xe2\x80\x9cemployers.\xe2\x80\x9d  That respondents are jointly and severally liable for the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s debts is irrelevant to this determination.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Code does not require the Government to make separate assessments of a single tax debt against persons or entities secondarily liable for that debt in order for \xc2\xa76502\xe2\x80\x99s extended limitations period to apply to judicial collection actions against those persons or entities.  It is clear that \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa76201, and that it is <em>the tax</em> that is assessed, not the taxpayer, see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa76501.  The limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs the time extension for enforcing the tax liability.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Updike,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/281/489/index.html">281 U. S. 489</a>, 495.  Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s debt.  The assessment\xe2\x80\x99s consequences\xe2\x80\x94the extension of the limitations period for collecting the debt\xe2\x80\x94attach to the debt without reference to the special circumstances of the secondarily liable parties.  Here, the tax was properly assessed against the Partnership, thereby extending the limitations period for collecting the debt.  The United States now timely seeks to collect that debt in judicial proceedings against respondents.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(a).  If a tax is properly assessed within three years, however, the statute of limitations for the collection of the tax is extended by 10 years from the date of assessment.  \xc2\xa76502(a).  We must decide in this case whether, in order for the United States to avail itself of the 10-year increase in the statute of limitations for collection of a tax debt, it must assess the taxes not only against a partnership that is directly liable for the debt, but also against each individual partner who might be jointly and severally liable for the debts of the partnership.  Under California law a partnership maintains a separate identity from its general partners, and the partners are only secondarily liable for the tax debts of the partnership, as they are for any debt of the partnership.  Because, in this case, the only relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76501\xe2\x80\x936502 is the partnership, we hold that the proper assessment of the tax against the partnership suffices to extend the statute of limitations for collection of the tax from the general partners who are liable for the payment of the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s debts.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s timely assessment of the tax against the partnership was sufficient to extend the statute of limitations to collect the tax in a judicial proceeding, whether from the partnership itself or from those liable for its debts.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents, Abel Cosmo Galletti, Sarah Galletti, Francesco Briguglio, and Angela Briguglio, were general partners of Marina Cabrillo Company (Partnership).  From 1992 to 1995, the Partnership failed to pay significant federal employment tax liabilities that it had incurred.  Although the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) timely assessed those taxes against the Partnership in 1994, 1995, and 1996, the Partnership never satisfied the debt.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents Abel and Sarah Galletti and respondents Francesco and Angela Briguglio filed joint petitions for relief under Chapter 13 of the Bankruptcy Code on October 20, 1999, and February 4, 2000, respectively.  In the Gallettis\xe2\x80\x99 proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the amount of $395,179.89 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between January 1994 and July 1995 against the Partnership.  In the Briguglios\xe2\x80\x99 proceedings, the IRS filed a proof of claim in the amount of $427,402.74.  The proof of claim included secured claims totaling $403,264.06 for unpaid employment taxes assessed between January 1994 and November 1996 against the Partnership.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents objected to the claims on the ground that they were not proven against the estates.  Respondents did not dispute that under California law they are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the Partnership.  Nor did they dispute that the IRS had properly assessed the taxes against the Partnership within the 3-year statute of limitations, thereby extending the limitations period for collection of the taxes by 10 years.  Rather, respondents argued that the timely assessment of the Partnership extended the statute of limitations only against the Partnership.  To extend the 3-year statute of limitations against the general partners, respondents argued, the IRS had to separately assess the general partners within the 3-year limitations period.  Because it did not, and because the 3-year limitations period had expired, respondents argued that the IRS could no longer collect the debt from them.  The Bankruptcy Court and the District Court agreed and sustained respondents\xe2\x80\x99 objections to the claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  The Government argued that the Code does not require that the individual partners be assessed within the 3-year period prescribed by \xc2\xa76501 and that the IRS made a valid assessment of the taxpayer here because the Partnership is the only relevant \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court of Appeals held that since respondents are \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa77701(a)(14), which defines \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cany person subject to any internal revenue tax,\xe2\x80\x9d they are also \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76203 and 6501.  As such, the Court of Appeals held that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he assessment against the Partnership extended the statute of limitations only with respect to the Partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d  314 F.\xc2\xa03d 336, 340 (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government argued in the alternative that because respondents conceded that they were liable for the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s employment tax debts as a matter of California law, the Government had a right to payment, which suffices to prove a valid claim in bankruptcy.  See 11 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101(5)(A) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d as including a \xe2\x80\x9cright to payment, whether or not such right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated, fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable, secured, or unsecured\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument because, under California law, a creditor must obtain a judgment against a partner before holding that partner liable for the partnership\xe2\x80\x99s debt.  Cal. Corp. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716307(c) (Supp. 2004).  At the time the United States filed its proof of claim, it had not obtained a separate judgment against respondents, and the time for obtaining a judgment under the Internal Revenue Code against respondents had expired.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 539 U. S. ___ (2003), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 6501(a) of the Internal Revenue Code provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of any tax imposed [by the Code] shall be assessed within 3 years after the return was filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76501(a).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary [of the Treasury] in accordance with rules or regulations prescribed by the Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76203.  Within 60 days of the assessment, the Secretary is required to \xe2\x80\x9cgive notice to each person liable for the unpaid tax, stating the amount and demanding payment thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76303(a).  If the tax is properly assessed within 3 years, the limitations period for collection of the tax is extended by 10 years from the date of the assessment.  \xc2\xa76502.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispute in this case centers on whether the United States can collect the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s unpaid employment taxes from respondents in a judicial proceeding occurring more than three years after the tax return was filed but within the 10-year extension to the 3-year limitations period that attached when the tax was timely assessed against the Partnership.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Respondents insist that a valid assessment (that is, one that would trigger the 10-year increase in the statute of limitations) must name them individually.  This is so, according to respondents, because they are primarily liable for the tax debt, both because they are \xe2\x80\x9cthe [relevant] taxpayer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa76203 and because they are jointly and severally liable for the tax debts of the partnership.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We reject both arguments in turn.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue, and the Court of Appeals agreed, that each partner is primarily liable for the debt and must be individually assessed because each partner is a separate \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d under 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76203.  The statutory definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d includes \xe2\x80\x9cany person subject to any internal revenue tax,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d includes both \xe2\x80\x9can individual\xe2\x80\x9d and a \xe2\x80\x9cpartnership,\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77701(a)(14), (a)(1).  The Court of Appeals observed that although the Partnership is a \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d each individual partner is also a separate \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer.\xe2\x80\x9d  As such, the Court of Appeals interpreted \xc2\xa76203\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the Secretary of the Treasury record \xe2\x80\x9cthe liability of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d to require a separate assessment against each of the general partners.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the Court of Appeals correctly concluded that an individual partner can be a \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayer,\xe2\x80\x9d the inquiry does not end there.  Section 6203 speaks of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the liability</em> of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), which indicates that the relevant taxpayer must be determined.  The liability in this case arose from the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with \xc2\xa73402(a)(1) of the Code, which requires \xe2\x80\x9cevery employer making payment of wages\xe2\x80\x9d to deduct and withhold employment taxes.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73403.  When an employer fails to\nwithhold and submit the requisite amount of employ-\nment taxes, \xc2\xa73403 makes clear that the liable taxpayer\nis the employer.  In this case, the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer\xe2\x80\x9d was the Partnership.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents also argue that they are primarily liable for the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s tax debt because, under California law, general partners are jointly and severally liable for the debts of their partnership, Cal. Corp. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716306 (Supp. 2004).  Brief for Respondents 8\xe2\x80\x9316.  As our prior discussion demonstrates, however, respondents cannot show that they are primarily liable for the payment of the Partnership\xe2\x80\x99s employment taxes unless they can show that they are the \xe2\x80\x9cemployer.\xe2\x80\x9d  However, under California\xe2\x80\x99s partnership principles, a partnership and its general partners are separate entities.  See Cal. Corp. Code Ann. \xc2\xa716201 (Supp. 2004).  Thus respondents cannot argue that, for all intents and purposes, imposing a tax directly on the Partnership is equivalent to imposing a tax directly on the general partners.  Respondents must instead prove that the tax liability was imposed both on the Partnership and respondents as separate \xe2\x80\x9cemployers.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that respondents are jointly and severally liable for the debts of the Partnership is irrelevant to this\ndetermination.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now turn to the question whether the Government must make separate assessments of a single tax debt against persons or entities secondarily liable for that debt in order for \xc2\xa76502\xe2\x80\x99s extended statute of limitations to apply to those persons or entities.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  We hold that the Code contains no such requirement.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument that they must be separately assessed turns on a mistaken understanding of the function and nature of an assessment as identical to the initiation of a formal collection action against any person or entity who might be liable for payment of a debt.  In its numerous uses throughout the Code, it is clear that the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d refers to little more than the calculation or recording of a tax liability.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76201 (assessment authority); \xc2\xa76203 (method of assessment); \xc2\xa76204 (supplemental assessments); 26 CFR \xc2\xa7601.103 (2003).  See also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 111 (7th ed. 1999) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9c[d]etermination of the [tax] rate or amount of something, such as a tax or damages\xe2\x80\x9d).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Federal tax system is basically one of self-assessment,\xe2\x80\x9d whereby each taxpayer computes the tax due and then files the appropriate form of return along with the requisite payment.  26 CFR \xc2\xa7601.103(a) (2003).  In most cases, the Secretary accepts the self-assessment and simply records the liability of the taxpayer.  Where the taxpayer fails to file the form of return or miscalculates the tax due, as in this case, the Secretary can assess \xe2\x80\x9call taxes (including interest, additional amounts, additions to the tax, and assessable penalties),\xe2\x80\x9d 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76201(a), by \xe2\x80\x9crecording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa76203.  In other words, where the Secretary rejects the self-assessment of the taxpayer or discovers that the taxpayer has failed to file a return, the Secretary calculates the proper amount of liability and records it in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s books.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, the assessment of a tax triggers certain consequences.  After the amount of liability has been established and recorded, the IRS can employ administrative enforcement methods to collect the tax.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76321\xe2\x80\x936327, 6331\xe2\x80\x936334.  The assessment of a tax liability also extends the period during which the Government can collect the tax.  But the fact that the act of assessment has consequences does not change the function of the assessment: to calculate and record a tax liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under a proper understanding of the function and nature of an assessment, it is clear that it is <em>the tax</em> that is assessed, not the taxpayer.  See \xc2\xa76501(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of any tax \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be assessed\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa76502(a) (\xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the assessment of any tax\xe2\x80\x9d).  And in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Updike,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/281/489/index.html">281 U. S. 489</a> (1930), the Court, interpreting a predecessor to \xc2\xa76502, held that the limitations period resulting from a proper assessment governs \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent of time for the enforcement of the tax liability,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 495.  In other words, the Court held that the statute of limitations attached to the debt as a whole.  The basis of the liability in <em>Updike</em> was a tax imposed on the corporation, and the Court held that the same limitations period applied in a suit to collect the tax from the corporation as in a suit to collect the tax from the derivatively liable transferee.  <em>Id.,</em> at 494\xe2\x80\x93496.  See also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wright</em>, 57 F.\xc2\xa03d 561, 563 (CA7 1995) (holding that, based on <em>Updike</em>\xe2\x80\x99s principle of \xe2\x80\x9call-for-one, one-for-all,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute of limitations governs the debt as a whole).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Once a tax has been properly assessed, nothing in the Code requires the IRS to duplicate its efforts by separately assessing the same tax against individuals or entities who are not the actual taxpayers but are, by reason of state law, liable for payment of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s debt.

Indeed, the closest respondents have come to arguing that the state limitations period applies was in the Court of Appeals, when respondents argued that \xe2\x80\x9cunder California law, any collections suit filed against a partner to collect a partnership debt is subject to the statute limitation provision which applies to the underlying debt of the partnership.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents in Nos. 01\xe2\x80\x9355953, 01\xe2\x80\x9355954 (CA9), p.\xc2\xa014.\xc2\xa0 This argument, of course, is contrary to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position in this Court.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Our decision is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Williams,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/527/index.html">514 U.
