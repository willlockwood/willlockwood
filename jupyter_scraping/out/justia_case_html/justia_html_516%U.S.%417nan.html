The Anti-Deficiency Act, which bars federal employees from entering into contracts for future payment of money in advance of, or in excess of, an existing appropriation, 31 U. S.

We hold that they may not do so.</p><p>When the United States had armed forces stationed in Southeast Asia in the 1960\'s, it asked several chemical manufacturers, including petitioners Hercules Incorporated (Hercules) and Wm. T. Thompson Company (Thompson), to manufacture and sell it a specific phenoxy herbicide, code-named Agent Orange. The Department of Defense wanted to spray the defoliant in high concentrations on tree and plant life in order to both eliminate the enemy\'s hiding places and destroy its food supplies. From 1964 to 1968, the Government, pursuant to the Defense Production Act of 1950 (DPA), 64 Stat. 798, as amended, 50 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2061 <i>et seq. (1988 </i>ed. and Supp. V), entered into a series of fixed-price production contracts with petitioners. The military prescribed the formula and detailed specifications for manufacture.

Petitioners fully complied.</p><p>In the late 1970\'s, Vietnam veterans and their families began filing lawsuits against nine manufacturers of Agent Orange, including petitioners. The plaintiffs alleged that the veterans\' exposure to dioxin, a toxic byproduct found in Agent Orange and believed by many to be hazardous, had caused various health problems. The lawsuits were consolidated in the Eastern District of New York and a class action was certified. <i>In re "Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, </i>506 F.

Before the judgment was entered, however, the case was transferred to Chief Judge Weinstein, who withdrew Judge Pratt\'s opinion, ruled that the viability of the Government contractor defense could not be determined before trial, and reinstated petitioners as defendants. See <i>In re "Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, </i>597</p><p>In May 1984, hours before the start of trial, the parties settled. The defendants agreed to create a $180 million settlement fund with each manufacturer contributing on a market-share basis. Hercules\' share was $18,772,568; Thompson\'s was $3,096,597. Petitioners also incurred costs defending these suits exceeding $9 million combined.1</p><p>1 Nearly 300 plaintiffs decided to "opt out" of the certified class and to proceed with their claims independent of the class action. Mter the class action settled, the defendant manufacturers sought and received summary judgment against these plaintiffs. The District Court found that the optout plaintiffs failed to present credible evidence of a causal connection between the veterans\' exposure to Agent Orange and their alleged injuries and that the Government contractor defense barred liability. <i>In re </i>"Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, 611 F.

S. 500</a>, 512 (1988). Because the Court of Appeals believed petitioners could have availed themselves of this defense, the court held that, by settling, petitioners voluntarily assumed liability for which the Government was not responsible. It also rejected Thompson\'s claim of contractual indemnification. Thompson had argued that the Government, pursuant to \xc2\xa7 707 of the DPA, 50 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 2157 (1988 ed.), impliedly promised to indemnify Thompson for any liabilities incurred in performing under the DPA. Not persuaded, the court held that \xc2\xa7 707 did not create indemnification, but only provided a defense to a suit brought against the contractor by a disgruntled customer whose work order the DPA contract displaced. We granted certiorari, 514 U. S. 1049 (1995), and now affirm the judgment below but on different grounds.4</p><p>We begin by noting the limits of federal jurisdiction.

The dissent further observes that petitioners "also set forth" a third "much more general fact-based claim." <i>Post, </i>at 436. This third claim, we believe, is indistinguishable from the contractual-indemnification claim that Thompson (but not Hercules) has raised, and which we address. To the extent that it differs from a claim for contractual indemnification, we decline to consider it; such a claim was neither presented to the Court of Appeals nor argued in the briefs to this Court.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="423">423</a></p><p>(1941).

See, <i>e. g., Sutton, supra, </i>at 580-581 (refusing to recognize an implied agreement to pay the fair value of work performed because the term was not "express or implied in fact" in the Government contract for dredging services); <i>Lopez </i>v. <i>A. </i>C. &amp; <i>S., Inc., 858 </i>F. 2d 712, 714-715, 716 (CA Fed. 1988) (a <i>Spearin </i>warranty within an asbestos contract must be implied in fact).</p><p>The distinction between "implied in fact" and "implied in law," and the consequent limitation, is well established in</p><p>5 Under the Federal Courts Improvement Act of 1982, the newly created Claims Court inherited substantially all of the trial court jurisdiction of the Court of Claims. 96 Stat. 25.

An agreement implied in fact is "founded upon a meeting of minds, which, although not embodied in an express contract, is inferred, as a fact, from conduct of the parties showing, in the light of the surrounding circumstances, their tacit understanding." <i>Baltimore </i>&amp; <i>Ohio R. Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/592/case.html">261 U. S. 592</a>, 597 (1923). See also <i>Russell </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/182/516/case.html">182 U. S. 516</a>, 530 (1901) ("[T]o give the Court of Claims jurisdiction the demand sued on must be founded on a convention between the parties-\'a coming together of minds\' "). By contrast, an agreement implied in law is a "fiction of law" where "a promise is imputed to perform a legal duty, as to repay money obtained by fraud or duress." <i>Baltimore </i>&amp; <i>Ohio R. Co., supra, </i>at 597.</p><p>Petitioners do not contend that their contracts contain express warranty or indemnification provisions. Therefore, for them to prevail, they must establish that, based on the circumstances at the time of contracting, there was an implied agreement between the parties to provide the undertakings that petitioners allege. We consider petitioners\' warranty-of-specifications and contractual-indemnification claims in turn.</p><p>The seminal case recognizing a cause of action for breach of contractual warranty of specifications is <i>United States </i>v. <i>Spearin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/248/132/case.html">248 U. S. 132</a> (1918). In that case, Spearin had contracted to build a dry dock in accordance with the Government\'s plans which called for the relocation of a storm sewer. After Spearin had moved the sewer, but before he had completed the dry dock, the sewer broke and caused the site to flood. The United States refused to pay for the damages and annulled the contract. Spearin filed suit to recover the balance due on his work and lost profits. This Court held that "if the contractor is bound to build according to plans and specifications prepared by [the Government], the contractor will not be responsible for the consequences of defects in the plans and specifications." <i>Id., </i>at 136. From this, petitioners contend the United States is responsible for</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="425">425</a></p><p>costs incurred in defending and settling the third-party tort claims.</p><p>Neither the warranty nor <i>Spearin </i>extends that far.</p><p>When the Government provides specifications directing how a contract is to be performed, the Government warrants that the contractor will be able to perform the contract satisfactorily if it follows the specifications. The specifications will not frustrate performance or make it impossible. It is quite logical to infer from the circumstance of one party providing specifications for performance that that party warrants the capability of performance. But this circumstance alone does not support a further inference that would extend the warranty beyond performance to third-party claims against the contractor. In this case, for example, it would be strange to conclude that the United States, understanding the herbicide\'s military use, actually contemplated a warranty that would extend to sums a manufacturer paid to a third party to settle claims such as are involved in the present action. It seems more likely that the Government would avoid such an obligation, because reimbursement through contract would provide a contractor with what is denied to it through tort law. See <i>Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/666/case.html">431 U.

Although we decided <i>Stencel </i>after the formation of the Agent Orange contracts, we observed in that opinion that the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in 1964 had adopted the position we would hold in <i>Stencel, </i>and that decisions inconsistent with that view began to arise in the Circuits only in 1972. <i>Stencel, </i>431 U.

If JUSTICE BREYER is suggesting that the petitioners need further discovery to develop claims alleged in the complaints and not to some unarticulated third claim, see n. 4, <i>supra; post, </i>at 436), we believe his plea for further discovery must necessarily apply only to Thompson\'s contractual-indemnification claim; we hold in this case that the <i>Spearin </i>claims made by both petitioners do not extend to postperformance third-party costs as a matter of law. See <i>supra, </i>at 425. In any event, JUSTICE BREYER fails to explain what facts are needed, or might be developed, which would place a court on remand in a better position than where we sit today.

The Anti-Deficiency Act bars a federal employee or agency from entering into a contract for future payment of money in advance of, or in excess of, an existing appropriation. 31 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 1341.9 Ordinarily no federal appropriation covers contractors\' payments to third-party tort claimants in these circumstances, and the Comptroller General has repeatedly ruled that Government procurement agencies may not enter into the type of open-ended indemnity for third-party liability that petitioner Thompson claims to have implicitly received under the Agent Orange contracts.lO We view the Anti-Deficiency Act, and the contract-</p><p>as true and still find them inadequate. In addition, we are skeptical that any material information regarding these 30-year-old transactions remains undisclosed, yet still discoverable. Hercules, and presumably Thompson, had access to all discovery materials (including thousands of documents and scores of depositions) produced during the <i>Agent Orange </i>class-action litigation. See Motion of United States for a Protective Order Staying Discovery in No. 90-496 (Cl. Ct.), pp. 1,3-4, n. 1.</p><p>9The Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U. S.

JUSTICE BREYER finds our reliance on the Comptroller General problematic because of a Comptroller General opinion that finds capped indemnity agreements not improper. <i>Post, </i>at 437-438. But the Anti-Deficiency Act applies equally to capped indemnification agreements.

The companies argue that their contracts with the Government to produce Agent Orange contain certain promises or warranties that, in effect, hold them harmless. To win this case, as in the most elementary breach-of-contract case, the companies must show that the Government in fact made the warranties or promises, that the Government breached them, and that the Agent Orange settlement contribution was a consequent foreseeable harm. See Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7346, 347, 351 (1979); 5 A.

They conclude that the Government, in the contracts, took responsibility for those risks by implicitly promising to assume responsibility for the consequences of specification defects, including indemnification for the settlement of defect-related tort suits.</p><p>The Federal Circuit affirmed a grant of summary judgment against the companies. But, in doing so, it did not decide against the companies in respect to their claimed promises. Instead the Federal Circuit assumed (reluctantly and for argument\'s sake) that the companies would be able to prove the existence of the promises, but it went on to hold against them regardless. Even assuming the promises, the Circuit wrote, the companies will not be able to prove <i>causation </i>between promises and damages. The Circuit believed that, had the companies litigated the Agent Orange tort suits instead of settling them, they would have asserted a "government contractor defense," see <i>Boyle </i>v. <i>United Technologies Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/487/500/case.html">487 U. S. 500</a> (1988), and thereby won the lawsuits. It concluded that, since the companies could readily have won the suits, the settlement amounts to a "voluntary payment" that cuts any causal link between a broken promise, or warranty, and resulting harm.</p><p>The companies, in their petition for certiorari and initial brief on the merits, primarily asked us to review, and to re-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="434">434</a></p><p>verse, this "no causation" holding. The Court, in today\'s opinion, does not discuss that holding. Instead it holds that the companies will not be able to prove the existence of the implicit promises. In my view, however, the record before us now does not permit this latter holding. Rather, this Court should reverse the Court of Appeals\' "no causation" holding and then remand this case for further proceedings.</p><p>I need mention only one fatal flaw in the Court of Appeals\' "no causation" holding, that of hindsight. The Court of Appeals, in essence, found the companies\' Agent Orange settlement so obviously unnecessary, so abnormal, so far removed from ordinary litigation behavior, that it could not have been "foreseeable," see Restatement (Second) of Contracts \xc2\xa7 351; 5 Corbin, Contracts \xc2\xa7 1002, or (if I recast the same point in the Court\'s tort-like "causation" language) that it cut the causal link between promise breach and harm. But, viewed without the benefit of legal hindsight, the settlement was neither unforeseeable nor was it an intervening "cause" of the loss.</p><p>In 1984, when the companies settled, the settlement was not notably different in terms of reasonableness or motivation from other settlements that terminate major litigation, for at that time the law that might have provided the companies with a defense was far less clear than it is today. I concede that even then <i>some </i>Circuits already had found in the law a "government contractor defense" that, in effect, immunized defense contractors from most suits by servicemen claiming injury from defective products. See <i>McKay </i>v. <i>Rockwell International Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/704/444/">704 F.2d 444</a>, 448-451 (CA9 1983), cert. denied, 464 U.

But, <i>most </i>of these Circuits had held that the existence of such a defense was a matter of state law, which might differ among the States. See <i>Brown, supra; Tillett, supra; Hansen </i>v. <i>JohnsManville Products Corp., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/734/1036/">734 F.2d 1036</a>, 1044-1045 (CA5</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="435">435</a></p><p>1984), cert. denied, 470 U. S. 1051 (1985). The Second Circuit, the home of the Agent Orange litigation, had not decided the issue. And, the two Agent Orange Second Circuit trial judges who (due to certain here irrelevant procedural considerations) <i>both </i>considered the companies\' "government contractor" defense decided the issue in opposite ways. Compare <i>In re "Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, </i>565 F. Supp. 1263, 1274-1275 (EDNY 1983), with <i>In re "Agent Orange" Product Liability Litigation, </i>597 F.

Fraticelli </i>v. <i>Dow Chemical Co., </i>484 U. S. 1004 (1988). This Court did not authoritatively uphold the "government contractor" defense until 1988, four years after the settlement here at issue. <i>Boyle, supra. </i>And, it did so on a ground different from that upon which the Circuit Courts had previously relied. Compare <i>McKay, supra, </i>at <i>448-451; </i>Tillett, supra, at 596-597 (finding the "government contractor defense" implicit in <i>Feres </i>v. <i>United States, 340 </i>U. S. 135 (1950)), with <i>Boyle, supra, </i>at 509-511 (explicitly rejecting <i>Feres </i>as the basis for a "government contractor defense").</p><p>In light of this contemporaneous legal uncertainty, the settlement, viewed from the companies\' perspective and without benefit of hindsight, seems a reasonable litigation strategy, through which the companies avoided added litigation costs and the threat of significant additional liability while helping to provide the veterans with at least some compensation. See <i>In re "Agent Orange," </i>597 F. Supp., at 749 (explaining why Agent Orange District Court approved the settlement). Nothing in the record here suggests the contrary. And, if reasonable at the time, the settlement must have been a "foreseeable" potential consequence of litigation and therefore within the scope of what the companies claim were implicit promises or warranties protecting them against the harms of litigation. See also <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/24/188/">24 F.3d 188</a>, 205-208 (CA Fed. 1994) (Plager, C. J., dissenting). For that reason, this Court</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="436">436</a></p><p>simply should set aside the Court of Appeals\' determination on the point.</p><p>The Court instead decides this case on an alternative basis, namely, that the companies cannot prove the existence of the implicit promises or warranties that they claim. But the existence of a contractual promise implied in fact is very much a creature of particular circumstance-the particular terms, the negotiating circumstances, and the background understandings of law or industry practice. See 3 Corbin, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 562, 566-570. Unlike the majority, which compartmentalizes the companies\' claims into several separate doctrinal categories (a <i>"Spearin" </i>claim, an implied indemnification claim)-each rejected separately for doctrine-specific reasons-I believe the companies\' submissions, fairly read, also set forth a much more general fact-based claim. In essence, the companies say that the parties, when specifying the details of this compulsory defense order, implicitly agreed to allocate to the Government certain risks of defective-government-specification-caused harm-namely, those risks for which each company, because of its inferior knowledge, could not seek compensation in the contract price. And, the companies allege background facts that, <i>if </i>true and complete (as we must assume at this stage of the proceedings), make that implication plausible.</p><p>The legal considerations to which the majority points do not answer the companies\' basic implied-in-fact contentions. To do so, the majority would have to argue that the five sets of legal circumstances to which it points, taken separately or together, show that no Government contracting officer would have agreed to a promise or warranty (of the sort claimed); hence, one cannot possibly imply the existence of such a promise "in fact." See 3 Corbin, <i>supra, </i>\xc2\xa7 561. The majority cannot argue that, because those five sets of circumstances suggest the contrary.</p><p>First, the majority implies that a contracting officer, in all likelihood, would not have agreed to an implicit promise of</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="437">437</a></p><p>indemnity, for doing so would amount to a bypass of, and "render ... superfluous," the statutes and "panoply of implementing regulations" that set forth specific procedures that contractors must follow to obtain a promise of indemnity. <i>Ante, </i>at 429. My problem with this argument lies in the fact that, in 1964, the <i>relevant </i>statute, Executive Order, and regulations read very differently. At that time, their language was nonspecific or ambiguous on the procedures required for indemnification. The <i>statute </i>has always been phrased in general language, making no explicit reference to indemnification. See 50 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1431 (1988 ed., Supp. V); 50 u. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1431 (1964 ed.). The portion of the Executive Order that today treats indemnification as special, and sets out procedures for indemnification, <i>did not exist </i>in 1964, and the relevant regulations were also either silent or much more ambiguous than they are today. Compare Exec. Order 11610, 3 CFR 594 (1971-1975 Comp.) (indemnification), with Exec. Order 10789, 3 CFR 426 (1954-1958 Comp.) (no specific reference to indemnification); compare 32 CFR \xc2\xa7 17-301 <i>et </i>seq. (1975) (implementing today\'s indemnification procedures) with 32 CFR \xc2\xa7 17-301 <i>et seq. </i>(1964) (no reference to indemnification procedures) and 32 CFR \xc2\xa7 17.204-4 (1960) ("Informal commitments may be formalized under certain circumstances to permit payment to persons who have taken action without formal contract <i>[e. </i>g., where a person has furnished property or services to the military in good-faith reliance on the apparent authority of a person giving an oral instruction]. Formalization of commitments under such circumstances normally will facilitate the national defense by assuring such persons that they will be treated fairly and paid expeditiously"); 32 CFR \xc2\xa7 17.206(i) (1964) (indemnification contracts must subject Government\'s obligation to availability of appropriated funds).</p><p>Second, the majority points to Comptroller General opinions that say that an "open-ended" agreement to indemnify would violate the Anti-Deficiency Act, 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1341 (1988</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="438">438</a></p><p>ed.). <i>Ante, </i>at 427, and n. 10 (citing <i>In re Assumption by Government of Contractor Liability to Third PersonsReconsideration, </i>62 Compo Gen. 361 (1983)). The problem with this argument is that other Comptroller General opinions say that an agreement to indemnify that is <i>not </i>openended, but is capped at an amount that a private insurer might have provided, is <i>not </i>improper. See <i>Reimbursement of Costs in Connection with Liabilities to Third Parties for Employees\' Negligence, </i>22 Compo Gen. 892 (1943). A capped agreement, which, if reflected in the contract price, makes the Government a kind of self-insurer, is in effect within the appropriation (because the expenditure of assuming the risk of liability will roughly equal the cost of premiums that the Government saves by self-insuring), and may well prove sufficient for the plaintiffs\' purposes. After all, on plaintiffs\' factual allegations, a contractor who was as aware of the plaintiffs\' alleged risks as was the Government would have sensed trouble, wanted insurance, and likely have obtained a premium payment sufficient to buy it. The companies need argue only for a capped implicit warranty that would treat the unknowing contractor similarly. See also <i>In re Government Indemnification of Public Utilities Against Loss Arising Out of Sale of Power to Government, </i>59 Compo Gen. 705 (1980) (indemnification in contracts with a "sole source" of a good or service lawful under AntiDeficiency Act). Whether an agreement to spend money beyond that which was appropriated is in writing or not is irrelevant to the Anti-Deficiency Act.</p><p>Third, the majority distinguishes <i>United States </i>v. <i>Spearin, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/248/132/case.html">248 U. S. 132</a> (1918), on the ground that the implied warranty that Justice Brandeis there discussed protects a contractor from "specifications" that, in the majority\'s words, will "frustrate performance or make it impossible," but does not "extend ... beyond performance to third-party claims against the contractor." <i>Ante, </i>at 425. <i>Spearin </i>itself does not make this distinction. Nor have subsequent cases. See</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="439">439</a></p><p><i>Michigan Wisconsin Pipeline Co. </i>v. <i>Williams-McWilliams </i><i>Co., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/551/945/">551 F.2d 945</a> (CA5 1977) (allowing recovery against the Government of damages paid by a Government contractor to a third party to which the contractor caused damage by following Government specifications). See also 24 F. 3d, at 197 <i>(Spearin </i>holds contractor harmless if the product proves defective). If the Government must pay, say, for the contractor\'s own machinery destroyed by a (defectivespecification-caused) explosion when that destruction frustrates performance, see <i>Ordnance Research, Inc. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/609/462/">609 F.2d 462</a>, 479 (Ct. Cl. 1979) (treating explosions causing increased costs as a breach of the warranty of specifications), why should the Government not also have to pay when the explosion takes place just after performance is complete? And, why should it not have to reimburse the contractor\'s payment for identical damage caused his nextdoor neighbor in the same explosion? In any event, whether or not there are good answers to these questions, they are unlikely to answer plaintiffs\' <i>further </i>argument, namely that, even if <i>Spearin </i>does not <i>compel </i>a decision in their favor, it offers indirect support, as background, for implying a promise that would provide (in the particular circumstances) <i>Spearin-like </i>protection.</p><p>Fourth, the majority says that the DPA\'s "hold harmless" provision ("No person shall be held liable for damages ... for any act or failure to act resulting directly or indirectly from compliance with [an] order") does not provide for indemnification. <i>Ante, </i>at 429. The petitioners, however, do not claim the contrary. They state explicitly that they "do not attempt to interpret the DPA\'s hold harmless language as an affirmative indemnity." Reply Brief for Petitioners 2. They add that "an indemnity should be implied from all the circumstances of this case, including the circumstance that petitioners and the Government contracted against the backdrop of the sweeping hold harmless language contained in the DPA." <i>Ibid. </i>They argue simply that the DPA\'s stated</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="440">440</a></p><p>objective-to relieve them of involuntarily created liabilitywould have led contracting officers in the 1960\'s (given the parties\' uncertainty about future statutory interpretation) to have believed that a contractual "hold harmless" warranty was reasonable in the circumstances, not the contrary. See 3 Corbin, Contracts \xc2\xa7 551 (existing statutes and rules of law are always evidence of the meaning of the parties). The relevant point is not whether Congress intended to indemnify, but the likely effect of the DPA\'s language (before judicial interpretation limited it to an immunity provision) on what risks contracting officers at the time might have thought the Government was assuming in a <i>forced </i>production contract under the Act.</p><p>Fifth, both the Federal Circuit, 24 F. 3d, at 198, n. 8, and the majority, <i>ante, </i>at 425, imply that a 1960\'s contracting officer would not have accepted an indemnification provision because of <i>Stencel Aero Engineering Corp. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/431/666/case.html">431 U. S. 666</a> (1977). That case held (in light of the <i>Feres </i>doctrine providing the Government with immunity from armed services personnel tort suits) that Government contractors, whom armed services personnel had sued in tort, could not, in turn, sue the Government for indemnification. Otherwise a soldier, unable (given <i>Feres) </i>to sue the Government for injury caused, say, by a defective rifle, would sue the rifle manufacturer instead, and the rifle manufacturer would then sue the Government for indemnity, thereby, in a sense, circumventing the immunity that <i>Feres </i>promised the Government.</p><p>One problem with this argument is that <i>Stencel </i>postdates the formation of the contracts here at issue by about a decade. More importantly <i>Stencel </i>does not involve <i>contractual promises </i>to indemnify a contractor. Rather it concerns an indemnification provided by state tort law. <i>Stencel, supra, </i>at 667-668, nn. 2, 3. And, it nowhere says, or directly implies, that the law prohibits the Government from agreeing, explicitly or implicitly, to indemnify a contractor. Indeed,</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="441">441</a></p><p>this Court has explicitly written that it "fail[s] to see how the <i>Stencel </i>holding ... supports the conclusion that if the Tort Claims Act bars a tort remedy, neither is there a contractual remedy. The absence of Government tort liability has not been thought to bar contractual remedies on implied-in-fact contracts, even in those cases also having elements of a tort." <i>Hatzlachh Supply Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/460/case.html">444 U. S. 460</a>, 465 (1980) <i>(per curiam). </i>I agree with the majority insofar as it warns against a court\'s <i>too easily </i>reading an implicit promise to indemnify a contractor\'s armedservices-related tort liability; but, then, its words would represent simply a wise caution and not an absolute prohibition.</p><p>In sum, the companies argue factual circumstances-compelled production, superior knowledge, detailed specifications, and significant defect-which, if true, suggest that a government, dealing in good faith with its contractors, would have agreed to the "implied" promise, particularly in light of legal authorities, known at the time, that offered somewhat similar guarantees to contractors in somewhat similar circumstances. The validity of their claim is likely to turn on the strength of the companies\' factual case, as supported by evidence, and upon the details of Government contracting practices in the 1960\'s-matters not now before us and with which the lower courts are more familiar than are we.</p><p>The Court today unnecessarily restricts <i>Spearin </i>warranties, and, lacking particular facts at this stage of the proceeding, it relies on statutory circumstances that are common to many Government contracts. I fear that the practical effect of disposing of the companies\' claim at this stage of the proceeding will be to make it more difficult, in other cases even if not here, for courts to interpret Government contracts with an eye toward achieving the fair allocation of risks that the parties likely intended.</p><p>For these reasons, I would remand this case for further proceedings.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
