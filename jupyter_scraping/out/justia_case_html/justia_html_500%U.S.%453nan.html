We hold that it is the weight of the blotter paper containing LSD, and not the weight of the pure LSD, which determines eligibility for the minimum sentence.</p>\n<p>Petitioners Richard L. Chapman, John M. Schoenecker, and Patrick Brumm were convicted of selling 10 sheets (1000 doses) of blotter paper containing LSD, in violation of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(a).  The District Court included the total weight of the paper and LSD in determining the weight of the drug to be used in calculating petitioners\' sentences.  Accordingly, although the weight of the LSD alone was approximately 50 milligrams, the 5.7 grams combined weight of LSD and blotter paper resulted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 500 U. S. 456</a></p><p> in the imposition of the mandatory minimum sentence of five years required by 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(B)(v) for distributing more than one gram of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of LSD.  The entire 5.7 grams was also used to determine the base offense level under the United States Sentencing Commission Guidelines Manual (1990) (Sentencing Guidelines). [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Petitioners appealed, claiming that the blotter paper is only a carrier medium, and that its weight should not be included in the weight of the drug for sentencing purposes.  Alternatively, they argued that, if the statute and Sentencing Guidelines were construed so as to require inclusion of the blotter paper or other carrier medium when calculating the weight of the drug, this would violate the right to equal protection incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit en banc held that the weight of the blotter paper or other carrier should be included in the weight of the "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount" of LSD when computing the sentence for a defendant convicted of distributing LSD.  The Court of Appeals also found that Congress had a rational basis for including the carrier along with the weight of the drug, and therefore the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines did not violate the Constitution. <em>United States v. Marshall,</em> 908 F.2d 1312 (CA7 1990).  We granted certiorari, 498 U.S. 1011 (1990), and now affirm.</p>\n<p>Title 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(B) provides that</p>\n<p>"any person who violates subsection (a) of this section [making it unlawful to knowingly or intentionally manufacture, distribute, dispense, or possess with intent to manufacture, distribute, or dispense, a controlled substance], shall be sentenced as follows:"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    * </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 500 U. S. 457</a></em></p><p><em>" </em></p>\n<p>"(1)(B) In the case of a violation of subsection (a) of this section involving -- "</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"(v) 1 gram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD);"</p>\n<p><em>*    *    *    *\n</em></p>\n<p>"such person shall be sentenced to a term of imprisonment which may not be less than 5 years. . . ."</p>\n<p>Section 841(b)(1)(A)(v) provides for a mandatory minimum of 10 years\' imprisonment for a violation of subsection (a) involving "10 grams or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of [LSD]."  Section 2D1.1(c) of the Sentencing Guidelines parallels the statutory language and requires the base offense level to be determined based upon the weight of a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of" LSD.</p>\n<p>According to the Sentencing Commission, the LSD in an average dose weighs 0.05 milligrams; there are therefore 20,000 pure doses in a gram.  The pure dose is such an infinitesimal amount that it must be sold to retail customers in a "carrier."  Pure LSD is dissolved in a solvent such as alcohol, and either the solution is sprayed on paper or gelatin, or paper is dipped in the solution.  The solvent evaporates, leaving minute amounts of LSD trapped in the paper or gel.  Then the paper or gel is cut into "one-dose" squares and sold by the dose.  Users either swallow the squares, lick them until the drug is released, or drop them into a beverage, thereby releasing the drug.  Although gelatin and paper are light, they weigh much more than the LSD.  The ten sheets of blotter paper carrying the 1,000 doses sold by petitioners weighed 5.7 grams; the LSD by itself weighed only about 50 milligrams, not even close to the one gram necessary to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum of \xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(B)(v). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 500 U. S. 458</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that \xc2\xa7 841(b) should not require that the weight of the carrier be included when computing the appropriate sentence for LSD distribution, for the words "mixture or substance" are ambiguous, and should not be construed to reach an illogical result.  Because LSD is sold by dose, rather than by weight, the weight of the LSD carrier should not be included when determining a defendant\'s sentence, because it is irrelevant to culpability.  They argue that including the weight of the carrier leads to anomalous results, <em>viz:</em>  a major wholesaler caught with 19,999 doses of pure LSD would not be subject to the year mandatory minimum sentence, while a minor pusher with 200 doses on blotter paper, or even one dose on a sugar cube, would be subject to the mandatory minimum sentence. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Thus, they contend, the weight of the carrier should be excluded, the weight of the pure LSD should be determined, and that weight should be used to set the appropriate sentence. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 500 U. S. 459</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We think that petitioner\'s reading of the statute -- a reading that makes the penalty turn on the net weight of the drug, rather than the gross weight of the carrier and drug together -- is not a plausible one.  The statute refers to a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount."  So long as it contains a detectable amount, the entire mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.</p>\n<p>This reading is confirmed by the structure of the statute.  With respect to various drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and LSD, it provides for mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving certain weights of a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount" of the drugs.  With respect to other drugs, however, namely PCP or methamphetamine, it provides for a mandatory minimum sentence based either on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drug, or on lower weights of pure PCP or methamphetamine.  For example, \xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides for a mandatory 10-year minimum sentence for any person who distributes</p>\n<p>"100 grams or more of phencyclidine (PCP) or 1 kilogram or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of phencyclidine (PCP)."</p>\n<p>Thus, with respect to these two drugs, Congress clearly distinguished between the pure drug and a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of" the pure drug.  But with respect to drugs such as LSD, which petitioners distributed, Congress declared that sentences should be based exclusively on the weight of the "mixture or substance."  Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of the pure drug was to be used to determine the sentence, and did not make that distinction with respect to LSD.</p>\n<p>Chapman maintains that Congress could not have intended to include the weight of an LSD carrier for sentencing purposes, because the carrier will constitute nearly all of the weight of the entire unit, and the sentence will, therefore, be based on the weight of the carrier, rather than the drug.  The same point can be made about drugs like heroin and cocaine, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 500 U. S. 460</a></p><p> however, and Congress clearly intended the dilutant, cutting agent, or carrier medium to be included in the weight of those drugs for sentencing purposes.  Inactive ingredients are combined with pure heroin or cocaine, and the mixture is then sold to consumers as a heavily diluted form of the drug.  In some cases, the concentration of the drug in the mixture is very low.  <em>E.g., United States v. Buggs,</em> 904 F.2d 1070 (CA7 1990) (1.2% heroin); <em>United States v. Dorsey,</em> 192 U.S.App.D.C. 313, 591 F.2d 922 (DC 1978) (2% heroin); <em>United States v. Smith,</em> 601 F.2d 972 (CA8) (2.7 and 8.5% heroin), <em>cert. denied,</em> 444 U.S. 879 (1979).  But if the carrier is a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of the drug," then under the language of the statute, the weight of the mixture or substance, and not the weight of the pure drug, is controlling.</p>\n<p>The history of Congress\'s attempts to control illegal drug distribution shows why Congress chose the course that it did with respect to sentencing.  The Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, Pub.L. 91-513, 84 Stat. 1236, divided drugs by schedules according to potential for abuse.  LSD was listed in schedule I(c), which listed "any material, compound, mixture, or preparation, which contains any quantity of the following hallucinogenic substances," including LSD.  Pub.L. 91-513, \xc2\xa7 202(c).  That law did not link penalties to the quantity of the drug possessed; penalties instead depended upon whether the drug was classified as a narcotic or not.</p>\n<p>The Controlled Substances Penalties Amendments Act of 1984, which was a chapter of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, Pub.L. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2068, first made punishment dependent upon the quantity of the controlled substance involved.  The maximum sentence for distribution of 5 grams or more of LSD was set at 20 years.  21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) (1982 ED., Supp. II).  The 1984 amendments were intended "to provide a more rational penalty structure for the major drug trafficking offenses," S.Rep. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 500 U. S. 461</a></p><p> No. 98-225, 255 (1983), U.S.Code Cong. &amp; Admin.News 1984, pp. 3182, 3437, by eliminating sentencing disparities caused by classifying drugs as narcotic and non-narcotic.  <em>Id.</em> at 256.  Penalties were based instead upon the weight of the pure drug involved.  <em>See United States v. McGeehan,</em> 824 F.2d 677, 681 (CA8 1987), <em>cert. denied,</em> 484 U.S. 1061 (1988).</p>\n<p>The current penalties for LSD distribution originated in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, Pub.L. 99-570, 100 Stat. 3207 (1986).  Congress adopted a "market-oriented" approach to punishing drug trafficking, under which the total quantity of what is distributed, rather than the amount of pure drug involved, is used to determine the length of the sentence.  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, pt. 1, pp. 11-12, 17 (1986).  To implement that principle, Congress set mandatory minimum sentences corresponding to the weight of a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of" the various controlled substances, including LSD.  21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 841(b)(1)(A)(i)(viii) and (B)(i)(viii).  It intended the penalties for drug trafficking to be graduated according to the weight of the drugs in whatever form they were found -- cut or uncut, pure or impure, ready for wholesale or ready for distribution at the retail level.  Congress did not want to punish retail traffickers less severely, even though they deal in smaller quantities of the pure drug, because such traffickers keep the street markets going.  H.R.Rep. No. 99-845, <em>supra,</em> at pt. 1, p. 12.</p>\n<p>We think that the blotter paper used in this case, and blotter paper customarily used to distribute LSD, is a "mixture or substance containing a detectable amount" of LSD.  In so holding, we confirm the unanimous conclusion of the Courts of Appeals that have addressed the issue. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Neither the statute </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 500 U. S. 462</a></p><p> nor the Sentencing Guidelines define the terms "mixture" and "substance," nor do they have any established common law meaning.  Those terms, therefore, must be given their ordinary meaning.  <em>See Moskal v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/103/case.html">498 U. S. 103</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/103/case.html#108">498 U. S. 108</a></span> (1990).  A "mixture" is defined to include</p>\n<p>"a portion of matter consisting of two or more components that do not bear a fixed proportion to one another and that, however thoroughly commingled, are regarded as retaining a separate existence."</p>\n<p>Webster\'s Third New International Dictionary 1449 (1986).  A "mixture" may also consist of two substances blended together so that the particles of one are diffused among the particles of the other.  9 Oxford English Dictionary 921 (2d ed.1989).  LSD is applied to blotter paper in a solvent, which is absorbed into the paper and ultimately evaporates.  After the solvent evaporates, the LSD is left behind in a form that can be said to "mix" with the paper.  The LSD crystals are inside of the paper, so that they are commingled with it, but the LSD does not chemically combine with the paper.  Thus, it retains a separate existence and can be released by dropping the paper into a liquid, or by swallowing the paper itself.  The LSD is diffused among the fibers of the paper.  Like heroin or cocaine mixed with cutting agents, the LSD cannot be distinguished from the blotter paper, nor easily separated from it.  Like cutting agents used with other drugs that are ingested, the blotter paper, gel, or sugar cube carrying LSD can be and often is ingested with the drug.</p>\n<p>Petitioner argues that the terms "mixture" or "substance" cannot be given their dictionary meaning, because then the clause could be interpreted to include carriers like a glass vial or an automobile in which the drugs are being transported, thus making the phrase nonsensical.  But such nonsense is not the necessary result of giving the term "mixture" its dictionary meaning.  The term does not include LSD in a bottle, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 500 U. S. 463</a></p><p> or LSD in a car, because the drug is easily distinguished from, and separated from, such a "container."  The drug is clearly not mixed with a glass vial or automobile; nor has the drug chemically bonded with the vial or car.  It may be true that the weights of containers and packaging materials generally are not included in determining a sentence for drug distribution, but that is because those items are also clearly not mixed or otherwise combined with the drug.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that excluding the weight of the LSD carrier when determining a sentence is consistent with established principles of statutory construction.  First, they argue that the rule of lenity requires an ambiguous statute of this type to be construed in favor of the defendant.  Petitioners also argue that the statute should be construed to avoid a serious constitutional question and an interpretation of the statute that would require it to be struck down as violating due process.</p>\n<p>The rule of lenity, however, is not applicable unless there is a "grievous ambiguity or uncertainty in the language and structure of the Act," <em>Huddleston v.

But a person who has been so convicted is eligible for, and the court may impose, whatever punishment is authorized by statute for his offense, so long as that penalty is not cruel and unusual, <em>McMillan v.

In this context, as we noted in <em>Jones v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/354/case.html">463 U.

S. 362</a></span>, n. 10 (1983), an argument based on equal protection essentially duplicates an argument based on due process.</p>\n<p>We find that Congress had a rational basis for its choice of penalties for LSD distribution.  The penalty scheme set out in the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 is intended to punish severely large-volume drug traffickers at any level.  H.R.Rep. No. 99845, Pt. 1, at 12, 17.  It assigns more severe penalties to the distribution of larger quantities of drugs.  By measuring the quantity of the drugs according to the "street weight" of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold, rather than according to the net weight of the active component, the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines increase the penalty for persons who possess large quantities of drugs, regardless of their purity.  That is a rational sentencing scheme. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 500 U. S. 466</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This is as true with respect to LSD as it is with respect to other drugs.  Although LSD is not sold by weight, but by dose, and a carrier medium is not, strictly speaking, used to "dilute" the drug, that medium is used to facilitate the distribution of the drug.  Blotter paper makes LSD easier to transport, store, conceal, and sell.  It is a tool of the trade for those who traffic in the drug, and therefore it was rational for Congress to set penalties based on this chosen tool.  Congress was also justified in seeking to avoid arguments about the accurate weight of pure drugs which might have been extracted from blotter paper had it chosen to calibrate sentences according to that weight.</p>\n<p>Petitioners do not claim that the sentencing scheme at issue here has actually produced an arbitrary array of sentences, nor did their motions in district court contain any proof of actual disparities in sentencing.  Rather, they challenge the Act on its face on the ground that it will inevitably lead to arbitrary punishments.  While hypothetical cases can be imagined involving very heavy carriers and very little LSD, those cases are of no import in considering a claim by persons such as petitioners, who used a standard LSD carrier.  Blotter paper seems to be the carrier of choice, and the vast majority of cases will therefore do exactly what the sentencing scheme was designed to do -- punish more heavily those who deal in larger amounts of drugs.</p>\n<p>Petitioners argue that those selling different numbers of doses, and, therefore, with different degrees of culpability, will be subject to the same minimum sentence because of choosing different carriers. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The same objection could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 500 U. S. 467</a></p><p> be made to a statute that imposed a fixed sentence for distributing any quantity of LSD, in any form, with any carrier.  Such a sentencing scheme -- not considering individual degrees of culpability -- would clearly be constitutional. Congress has the power to define criminal punishments without giving the courts any sentencing discretion.  <em>Ex parte United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/242/27/case.html">242 U.

That distributors of varying degrees of culpability might be subject to the same sentence does not mean that the penalty system for LSD distribution is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>We likewise hold that the statute is not unconstitutionally vague.  First Amendment freedoms are not infringed by \xc2\xa7 841, so the vagueness claim must be evaluated as the statute is applied to the facts of this case.  <em>United States v.

The fact that there may be plausible arguments against describing blotter paper impregnated with LSD as a "mixture or substance" containing LSD does not mean that the statute is vague.  This is particularly so since whatever debate there is would center around the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 500 U.

Here, on the contrary, all of the Courts of Appeals that have decided the issue, and all except one district court, <em>United States v. Healy,</em> 729 F.Supp. 140 (DC 1990), have held that the weight of the carrier medium must be included in determining the appropriate sentence.</p>\n<p>We hold that the statute requires the weight of the carrier medium to be included when determining the appropriate sentence for trafficking in LSD, and this construction is neither a violation of due process, nor unconstitutionally vague.

For example, those selling 100 doses would receive the following disparate sentences:</p>\n<p>Base</p>\n<p>Carrier             Weight of   offense   Guidelines</p>\n<p>100 doses    level   range (months)</p>\n<p>Sugar cube . . . .   227 gr.      36       188-235</p>\n<p>Blotter paper. . .   1.4 gr.      26        63-78</p>\n<p>Gelatin capsule. .   225 mg.      18        27-33</p>\n<p>Pure[] LSD . . . .     5 mg.      12        10-16</p>\n<p>Brief for Petitioners (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<p>Even among dealers using blotter paper, the sentences can vary because the weight of the blotter paper varies from dealer to dealer.

Neither the ambiguous language of the statute, nor its sparse legislative history, supports the interpretation reached by the majority today.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  In a letter to Senator Joseph R. Biden, Jr., dated April 26, 1989, the Chairman of the Sentencing Commission, William W. Wilkens, Jr., commented on the ambiguity of the statute:</p>\n<p>"\'With respect to LSD, it is unclear whether Congress intended the carrier to be considered as a packaging material, or, since it is commonly consumed along with the illicit drug, as a dilutant ingredient in the drug mixture. . . .  The Commission suggests that Congress may wish to further consider the LSD carrier issue in order to clarify legislative intent as to whether the weight of the carrier should or should not be considered in determining the quantity of LSD mixture for punishment purposes.\'"</p>\n<p>908 F.2d at 1327-1328.  Presumably in response, Senator Biden offered a technical amendment, the purpose of which was to correct an inequity that had become apparent from several recent court decisions. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  According to Senator Biden, "[t]he amendment remedies this inequity by removing the weight of the carrier from the calculation of the weight of the mixture or substance."  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 500 U. S. 472</a></p><p> 135 Cong.Rec. S12748 (Oct. 5, 1989). [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Although Senator Biden\'s amendment was adopted as part of Amendment No. 976 to S. 1711, the bill never passed the House of Representatives.  Senator Kennedy also tried to clarify the language of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841.  He proposed the following amendment:</p>\n<p>"CLARIFICATION OF \'MIXTURE OR SUBSTANCE.\'"</p>\n<p>"Section 841(b)(1) of title 21, United States Code, is amended by inserting the following new subsection at the end thereof:"</p>\n<p>"   (E) In determining the weight of a \'mixture or substance\' under this section, the court shall not include the weight of the carrier upon which the controlled substance is placed, or by which it is transported."</p>\n<p>136 Cong.Rec. S7069-S7070 (May 24, 1990).</p>\n<p>Although such subsequent legislation must be approached with circumspection because it can neither clarify what the enacting Congress had contemplated nor speak to whether the clarifications will ever be passed, the amendments, at the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 500 U. S. 473</a></p><p> very least, indicate that the language of the statute is far from clear or plain.</p>\n<p>In light of the ambiguity of the phrase "mixture or substance" and the lack of legislative history to guide us, it is necessary to examine the congressional purpose behind the statute and to determine whether the majority\'s reading of the statute leads to results that Congress clearly could not have intended.  The figures in the Court\'s opinion, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/453/case.html#458">500 U. S. 458</a></span>, n. 2, are sufficient to show that the majority\'s construction will lead to anomalous sentences that are contrary to one of the central purposes of the Sentencing Guidelines, which was to eliminate disparity in sentencing.</p>\n<p>"Congress sought reasonable uniformity in sentencing by narrowing the wide disparity in sentences imposed for similar criminal offenses committed by similar offenders."</p>\n<p>U.S. Sentencing Comm\'n, Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual 1.2 (1991). [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]  As the majority\'s chart makes clear, widely divergent sentences may be imposed for the sale of identical amounts of a controlled substance simply because of the nature of the carrier. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  If 100 doses of LSD were sold on sugar cubes, the sentence would range from 188-235 months, whereas if the same dosage were sold in its pure liquid form, the sentence would range only from 10-16 months.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/500/453/case.html#458">500 U. S. 458</a></span>, n. 2.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 500 U. S. 474</a></p><p> The absurdity and inequity of this result is emphasized in Judge Posner\'s dissent:</p>\n<p>"A person who sells LSD on blotter paper is not a worse criminal than one who sells the same number of doses on gelatin cubes, but he is subject to a heavier punishment.  A person who sells five doses of LSD on sugar cubes is not a worse person than a manufacturer of LSD who is caught with 19,999 doses in pure form, but the former is subject to a ten-year mandatory minimum no-parole sentence, while the latter is not even subject to the five-year minimum.  If defendant Chapman, who received five years for selling a thousand doses of LSD on blotter paper, had sold the same number of doses in pure form, his Guidelines sentence would have been fourteen months.  And defendant Marshall\'s sentence for selling almost 12,000 doses would have been four years, rather than twenty.  The defendant in <em>United States v. Rose,</em> 881 F.2d 386, 387 (7th Cir.1989), must have bought an unusually heavy blotter paper, for he sold only 472 doses, yet his blotter paper weighed 7.3 grams -- more than Chapman\'s, although Chapman sold more than twice as many doses.  Depending on the weight of the carrier medium (zero when the stuff is sold in pure form), and excluding the orange juice case, the Guidelines range for selling 198 doses (the amount in <em>Dean</em>) or 472 doses (the amount in <em>Rose</em>) stretches from ten months to 365 months; for selling a thousand doses (<em>Chapman</em>), from fifteen to 365 months; and for selling 11,751 doses (<em>Marshall</em>), from 33 months to life.  In none of these computations, by the way, does the weight of the LSD itself make a difference -- so slight is its weight relative to that of the carrier -- except of course when it is sold in pure form.  Congress might as well have said:  if there is a carrier, weigh the carrier and forget the LSD. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 500 U. S. 475</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"This is a quilt the pattern whereof no one has been able to discern.  The legislative history is silent, and since even the Justice Department cannot explain the why of the punishment scheme that it is defending, the most plausible inference is that Congress simply did not realize how LSD is sold."</p>\n<p>908 F.2d at 1333. [<a href="#F2/12" name="T2/12">Footnote 2/12</a>]</p>\n<p>Sentencing disparities that have been described as "crazy," <em>ibid.,</em> and "loony," <em>id.</em> at 1332, could well be avoided if the majority did not insist upon stretching the definition of "mixture" to include the carrier along with the LSD.  It does not make sense to include a carrier in calculating the weight of the LSD because LSD, unlike drugs such as cocaine or marijuana, is sold by dosage, rather than by weight.  Thus, whether one dose of LSD is added to a glass of orange juice or to a pitcher of orange juice, it is still only one dose that has been added.  But if the weight of the orange juice is to be added to the calculation, then the person who sells the single dose of LSD in a pitcher, rather than in a glass, will receive a substantially higher sentence.  If the weight of the carrier is included in the calculation, not only does it lead to huge disparities in sentences among LSD offenders, but also it leads </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 500 U. S. 476</a></p><p> to disparities when LSD sentences are compared to sentences for other drugs.  <em>See</em> <l=|500 12|="" 453fn2="" u.s.="">n. 12, <em>supra;</em> 908 F.2d at 1335.</l=|500></p>\n<p>There is nothing in our jurisprudence that compels us to interpret an ambiguous statute to reach such an absurd result.  In fact, we have specifically declined to do so in the past, even when the statute was not ambiguous, on the ground that Congress could not have intended such an outcome. [<a href="#F2/13" name="T2/13">Footnote 2/13</a>]  In construing a statute, Learned Hand wisely counseled us to look first to the words of the statute, but</p>\n<p>"not to make a fortress out of the dictionary; but to remember that statutes always have some purpose or object to accomplish, whose sympathetic and imaginative discovery is the surest guide to their meaning."</p>\n<p><em>Cabell v.

[<a href="#F2/14" name="T2/14">Footnote 2/14</a>]  But it did not express any intention to treat those who sell LSD differently from those who sell other dangerous drugs. [<a href="#F2/15" name="T2/15">Footnote 2/15</a>]  The majority\'s construction of the statute fails to embody these legitimate goals of Congress.  Instead of punishing more severely those who sell large quantities of LSD, the Court would punish more severely those who sell small quantities of LSD in weighty carriers, and instead of sentencing in comparable ways those who sell different types of drugs, the Court would sentence those who sell LSD to longer terms than those who sell proportionately equivalent quantities of other equally dangerous drugs.

A Sentencing Commission Notice, issued on March 3, 1989, invited public comment on whether the Commission should exclude the weight of the carrier for sentencing purposes in LSD cases.  A section in the Guidelines Manual, entitled "Questions Most Frequently Asked About the Sentencing Guidelines," contains a question about the "mixture or substance" language, which reflects the Commission\'s continuing uncertainty as to whether the blotter paper should be weighed:</p>\n<p>"With respect to blotter paper, sugar cubes, or other mediums on which LSD or other controlled substances may be absorbed, the Commission has not definitively stated whether the carrier medium is considered part of a drug \'mixture or substance\' for guideline application purposes.  In order to ensure consistency between the guidelines and the statute, Application Note 1 to \xc2\xa7 2D1.1 states that the term \'mixture or substance\' has the same meaning for guideline purposes as in 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 841.  Thus, the court must determine whether, under this statute, LSD carrier medium would be considered part of an LSD mixture or substance.  To date, all circuit courts that have addressed the issue appear to be answering the question affirmatively."</p>\n<p>Federal Sentencing Guidelines Manual, <em>supra,</em> at 599.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/7" name="F2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>Of course, subsequent legislative history is generally not relevant, and always must be used with care in interpreting enacted legislation.  <em>Compare Sullivan v.
