JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question here is whether federal magistrates are authorized to conduct evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus cases.  In 1968, Congress enacted the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 418 U. S. 463</a></p><p> Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 631-639, to upgrade and expand the former United States commissioner system.  The Act authorizes magistrates to exercise all powers formerly exercised by United States commissioners, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and also, as a means of relieving the caseload burden of the federal district judges, empowers magistrates to try minor offenses when all parties consent, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] and to perform such additional duties assigned by the district court as are "not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Pursuant to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 418 U. S. 464</a></p><p> the Act; the Judges of the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky amended Local Rule 16 of that court to provide:</p>\n<p>"In addition to submitting such other reports and recommendations as may be required concerning petitions for writs of habeas corpus from state prisoners the full-time Magistrate is directed to schedule and hear evidentiary matters deemed by the Magistrate to be necessary and proper in the determination of each such petition, and to report thereon with an appropriate recommendation for the disposition thereof to the District Judge having jurisdiction of the case.  The Magistrate shall cause the testimony of such hearing to be recorded on suitable electronic sound recording equipment.  He shall submit his proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law to the proper Judge for his consideration, copies of which shall be provided at that time to the petitioner and respondent, and the Magistrate shall expeditiously transmit the proceedings, including the recording of the testimony, to the proper District Judge.  Upon written request of either party, filed within ten days from the date such is so transmitted to the District Judge having jurisdiction thereof, the District Judge shall proceed to hear the recording of the testimony given at the evidentiary hearing and give it <em>de novo</em> consideration. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 418 U. S. 465</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Respondent is a state prisoner whose petition for federal habeas corpus relief was assigned by the District Court to a full-time Magistrate for processing under the rule.  The part of the rule challenged here is that which directs the full-time magistrate</p>\n<p>"to schedule and hear evidentiary matters [to be electronically recorded] deemed by the Magistrate to be necessary and proper in the determination of . . . such petition, and to report thereon with an appropriate recommendation for the disposition thereof to the District Judge [who] . . . [u]pon . . . request . . . shall proceed to hear the recording of the testimony . . . and give it <em>de novo</em> consideration."</p>\n<p>The question is whether this portion of the rule is invalid because "inconsistent with the . . . laws of the United States" within the meaning of the Federal Magistrates Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(b), or because \xc2\xa7 636(b) itself should be construed to preclude district courts from assigning such duties to magistrates.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent, Carl James Wedding, is a prisoner in the Kentucky State Penitentiary serving a life sentence imposed in 1949 by the Webster Circuit Court, Commonwealth of Kentucky, after a plea of guilty to a charge of willful murder.  Wedding filed this petition for habeas corpus in 1971.  After the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit reversed the initial dismissal of his petition, 456 F.2d 245 (1972), and remanded for an evidentiary hearing, the District Court invoked Local Rule 16 and assigned the case to a full-time Magistrate to hold the hearing.  Wedding promptly moved that the Magistrate be disqualified and the hearing be reassigned to a District Judge, on the ground that the Federal Magistrates Act did not authorize district courts to assign to magistrates the duty to hold habeas corpus evidentiary hearings.  When the District Court denied the motion, the Magistrate proceeded </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 418 U. S. 466</a></p><p> with the hearing, and electronically recorded all testimonial evidence as required by Local Rule 16.  Thereafter, the Magistrate transmitted the recording of the testimony to the District Judge and submitted written findings of fact and conclusions of law recommending that the petition be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Wedding moved that the District Court give the matter a <em>de novo</em> hearing.  The District Judge\'s response was to listen, as authorized by Local Rule 16, to the recording of the hearing before the Magistrate.  On this basis and the Magistrate\'s findings and conclusions, the District Court entered an order dismissing respondent\'s petition.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Wedding renewed his challenge to Local Rule 16, relying upon <em>Holiday v. Johnston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/342/case.html">313 U. S. 342</a></span> (1941).  <em>Holiday</em> was also a federal habeas corpus case.  There, after determining that the petition for writ of habeas corpus alleged facts which, if proved, would entitle the petitioner to relief, the District Judge issued a writ compelling the respondent to produce the petitioner before a designated United States Commissioner.  The Commissioner held an evidentiary hearing at which the petitioner testified and the respondent submitted the depositions of two witnesses.  On the basis of the evidence received, the Commissioner made findings of fact and stated conclusions of law recommending that the writ be denied.  After hearing oral argument on the Commissioner\'s report, the District Judge entered an order discharging the writ.</p>\n<p>This Court reversed, holding that the factfinding procedure employed failed to conform to Congress\' express command in the Habeas Corpus Act that</p>\n<p>"[t]he <em>court, or justice, or judge</em> shall proceed in a summary way to determine the facts of the case, by hearing the testimony and arguments, and thereupon to dispose of the party as law and justice require."</p>\n<p>Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 418 U. S. 467</a></p><p> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 461 (1940 ed.) (emphasis added).  The Court held that the statute plainly accords a prisoner the right of testifying before a <em>judge,</em> stating:</p>\n<p>"One of the essential elements of the determination of the crucial facts is the weighing and appraising of the testimony.  Plainly it was intended that the prisoner might invoke the exercise of this appraisal by the judge himself.  We cannot say that an appraisal of the truth of the prisoner\'s oral testimony by a master or commissioner is, in the light of the purpose and object of the proceeding, the equivalent of the judge\'s own exercise of the function of the trier of the facts."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"The District Judge should himself have heard the prisoner\'s testimony and, in the light of it and the other testimony, himself have found the facts and based his disposition of the cause upon his findings."</p>\n<p><em>Holiday v.

Its root principle is that, in a civilized society, government must always be accountable to the judiciary for a man\'s imprisonment:  if the imprisonment cannot be shown to conform with the fundamental requirements of law, the individual is entitled to his immediate release."</p>\n<p><em>Fay v.

Accordingly, since the Judiciary Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, \xc2\xa7 1, 14 Stat. 385, Congress has expressly vested plenary power in the federal courts "for taking testimony and trying the facts anew in habeas hearings. . . ." [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Fay v. Noia, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/372/391/case.html#416">372 U.

The pertinent portion covering habeas corpus evidentiary hearings provides that "[t]he court shall summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require."  The Revisers thus deleted some </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 418 U. S. 469</a></p><p> words from Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, but the Revisers\' Notes accompanying \xc2\xa7 2243, together with the reports of the Committee of the Judiciary of the Senate, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] and of the House, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] make abundantly clear that the word changes and omissions in Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761 were intended only as changes in form. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Accordingly, the construction of \xc2\xa7 2243 has been that given \xc2\xa7 761 in <em>Holiday.</em> <em>United States v. Hayman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/case.html">342 U.

The Court held in the latter case:</p>\n<p>"A <em>federal judge</em> on a habeas corpus application is required to \'summarily hear and determine the facts, and dispose of the matter as law and justice require,\' 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2243.  This has long been the law.  R.S. \xc2\xa7 761, old 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 461."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our inquiry is thus narrowed to the question whether the Federal Magistrates Act changed the requirement of \xc2\xa7 2243 that federal judges personally conduct habeas corpus evidentiary hearings.  Certainly nothing in the text </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 418 U. S. 470</a></p><p> or legislative history of the Magistrates Act suggests that Congress meant to change that requirement. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Rather, both text and legislative history plainly reveal a congressional determination to retain the requirement.  For, although the Act gives district judges broad authority to assign a wide range of duties to magistrates, Congress carefully circumscribed the permissible scope of assignment to only "such additional duties as are <em>not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States.</em>"  28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(b) (emphasis added).  And in defining assignable duties, Congress decreed that the duty of holding evidentiary hearings was not assignable.  This clearly emerges from the legislative history of subsection (3) of \xc2\xa7 636(b), which provides:</p>\n<p>"(3) preliminary review of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case <em>as to whether there should be a hearing.</em>"</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>That legislative history reveals that the Judicial Conference of the United States objected to successive phrasings of subsection (b)(3) until it was phrased to make clear that the authority given district courts to assign duties to magistrates did not include authority to hold evidentiary hearings on applications for post-trial relief. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 418 U. S. 471</a></p><p> The original draft of the subsection [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] had proposed that magistrates\' duties include</p>\n<p>"(3) preliminary consideration of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses."</p>\n<p>But because that language was susceptible of the interpretation that magistrates might conduct evidentiary hearings, the Judicial Conference of the United States objected to it. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Accordingly, the subsection was rewritten to provide for</p>\n<p>"(3) preliminary review of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case. . . ."</p>\n<p>The Committee on the Administration of the Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference objected that the revision did not</p>\n<p>"make it clear that it is the judge\'s responsibility to make the ultimate decisions and to hold hearings on such applications, rather than that of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 418 U. S. 472</a></p><p> magistrate. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]"</p>\n<p>The Committee therefore recommended the addition of the phrase "as to whether there should be a hearing" immediately following the word "case." [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  The proposed addition was made, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and subsection (b)(3) in its present form was enacted.  Thus, although \xc2\xa7 636(b) provides that "additional duties authorized by rule may include, but are not restricted to," duties defined in subsection (b)(3), the legislative history of the subsection compels the conclusion that Congress made a deliberate choice to preclude district courts from assigning magistrates the duty to hold evidentiary hearings.</p>\n<p>We conclude that, since \xc2\xa7 2243 requires that the District Judge personally hold evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus cases, Local Rule 16, insofar as it authorizes the full-time magistrate to hold such hearings, is invalid because it is "inconsistent with the . . . laws of the United States" under \xc2\xa7 636(b).  We conclude further that the Rule is to that extent invalid, because, as we construe \xc2\xa7 636(b), that section itself precludes district judges from assigning magistrates the duty of conducting evidentiary hearings.

Indeed, data from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts indicate that very few habeas corpus cases ever reach the evidentiary hearing stage.  In 1973, of the 10,800 prisoner petitions filed for habeas corpus or as 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255 motions to vacate sentence, less than 5%, or approximately 530, necessitated evidentiary hearings.  <em>See</em> Report of the Director of the Administrative Office of United States Courts, Table C-2, p. 325, Table C-8, p. 383 (1973).  When hearings were required, 88% were completed in one day or less.  <em>Id.</em> at 383.  Thus, among the 400 District Judges, the burden of evidentiary hearings averages less than 1.5 hearing days per judge per year.

The Court\'s holding that federal magistrates may not conduct evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus case is both inconsistent with the new status of magistrates and deputy magistrates, [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] and serves to defeat the objective of the Act, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 418 U.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Hearings 3.</l=|418></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In its two-stage analysis, the Court finds first that, under the terms of the Act, it would be "inconsistent with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="477">Page 418 U. S. 477</a></p><p> the . . . laws of the United States," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(b), to permit magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings in habeas corpus cases.  This is so, it is said, because a procedural provision of the Habeas Corpus Act, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, was construed 33 years ago, long before the enactment of the Magistrates Act, to confine that function to judges alone.  <em>Holiday v. Johnston,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/313/342/case.html">313 U. S. 342</a></span> (1941).  The 1948 revision and recodification of the Judicial Code, which incorporated Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761 into 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2243, is held to have carried forward this limitation despite a critical language change.  <em>United States v. Hayman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/case.html">342 U. S. 205</a></span> (1952); <em>Brown v. Allen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html">344 U. S. 443</a></span> (1953).  Neither the new statute, its drafting history, nor these latter cases, support the Court\'s conclusion.</p>\n<p>Section 2243 did, as the Court notes, import into its terms Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, both of which provisions set forth in part what authority shall hear and determine the facts involved in an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  And \xc2\xa7 2243 changed the language of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, which originally read that the authority was to be the "court, or justice, or judge," now to read simply the "court."  But the Court fails to note that \xc2\xa7 2243 incorporated a second provision from the Habeas Corpus Act, Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 755, which, in part, set forth what authority shall issue the writ of habeas corpus for which application was made.  The authority to issue the writ set forth in Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 755 was identical to that set forth in Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761 to hear and determine the facts:  the "court, or justice, or judge."  Unlike the language of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, however, the quoted language of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 755 was incorporated into \xc2\xa7 2243 substantially unchanged; under the present statute, it is the "court, justice or judge" who shall issue the writ.</p>\n<p>Congress sought to make certain that only a "court, justice or judge" could issue the writ; but by changing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 418 U. S. 478</a></p><p> the authority to hear the facts from a "court, or justice, or judge" to, simply, a "court," Congress must have intended to broaden the authority of the court, at least to the extent of permitting delegation to a magistrate to perform the preliminary hearing function, subject always to the approval of a district judge. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  To read the language change in any other way would impute to Congress an intent to alter statutory language, the meaning of which had already been finally determined by this Court, <em>Holiday v. Johnston, supra,</em> without the knowledge that the alteration would raise interpretive difficulties.  Moreover, to change the language of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761, but not to change that of Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 755, cannot be said, as the Court does, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#469">418 U. S. 469</a></span> n. 9, to be a "[m]ere change of phraseology," for such changes were undertaken only for purposes of uniformity.  If, as Charles J. Zinn, counsel to the Law Revision Committee which revised the Judicial Code, testified, "we have changed the language to get a uniform style," [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] then, within the <em>same</em> statutory provision, surely Congress would have made only "courts" able to issue writs, as well as hear the facts of the claim.</p>\n<p>Nor do the cases cited by the Court, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#469">418 U. S. 469</a></span>, support its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2243.  <em>Brown v. Allen, supra,</em> is plainly inapposite.  The segment of <em>Brown</em> quoted by the Court is relevant to <em>Brown\'s</em> discussion of whether a petitioner under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2254 had a right to a plenary hearing although an earlier petition of his which presented substantially the same federal issues was refused in the state court.  When the Court quotes from <em>Brown:</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="479">Page 418 U. S. 479</a></p><p> "This has long been the law," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#469">418 U. S. 469</a></span>, it is referring to what the <em>Brown</em> Court called the "general rule" approved in <em>Salinger v. Loisel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/265/224/case.html">265 U. S. 224</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/265/224/case.html#231">265 U. S. 231</a></span> (1924).  <em>Brown,</em> 344 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html#463">344 U. S. 463</a></span>.  <em>Salinger,</em> in turn, makes it clear that the "general rule" which has "long been the law" has nothing whatever to do with who may hear and determine the facts on an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Rather, it pertains only to that portion of \xc2\xa7 2243 which <em>Brown</em> itself quoted, 344 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/443/case.html#462">344 U. S. 462</a></span>, and which <em>Salinger</em> also quoted, 265 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/265/224/case.html#231">265 U. S. 231</a></span>, that is, "to dispose of [the matter or party] as law and justice [may] require."  In <em>Salinger,</em> this rule meant each application for a writ of habeas corpus could be disposed of in the exercise of judicial discretion, which could in part give controlling weight to "a prior refusal [by a federal court] to discharge on a like application."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In <em>Brown,</em> that rule was extended under certain circumstances to a prior state court refusal to issue the writ, in support of the Court\'s conclusion there that a \xc2\xa7 2254 petitioner had no right to a plenary hearing on his application for the writ.  The rule the Court relies on today is thus one of discretion to hold an evidentiary hearing "as law and justice require," which has no bearing on what official shall conduct the hearing once a decision is made to hold one.  <em>Brown</em> is thus no authority for the proposition that the same limitation <em>Holiday</em> placed on Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761 ("court, or justice, or judge") applies to \xc2\xa7 2243 ("court") enacted after <em>Holiday.</em></p>\n<p>The Court also relies upon <em>United States v. Hayman, supra,</em> to support its interpretation of \xc2\xa7 2243.  The issue in <em>Hayman</em> had nothing to do with who shall hear and determine facts upon an application for a writ of habeas corpus.  Rather, the Court there was concerned solely with the question whether a district court may, upon an evidentiary hearing, decide factual issues presented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="480">Page 418 U. S. 480</a></p><p> by a motion under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 2255, where the movant was not notified and was not present.  In the context of discussing an earlier case which had held that a district court must decide material issues of fact by taking evidence, not by <em>ex parte</em> affidavits, <em>Hayman</em> dropped a footnote stating simply "[n]or can the factual issues be heard before a commissioner," citing <em>Holiday, supra.</em>  342 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/case.html#213">342 U. S. 213</a></span> n. 16.  Not only was this footnote completely irrelevant to the issue in <em>Hayman,</em> its citation to <em>Holiday</em> for support, without further discussion, makes manifest that the Court did not consider the effect of the subsequent language change in \xc2\xa7 2243 on the statute (Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 761) which <em>Holiday</em> construed.  The fulfillment of the purposes of the Federal Magistrates Act should not hang on such a slim reed.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Even assuming that \xc2\xa7 2243 was intended to carry forward the limitation of <em>Holiday\'s</em> interpretation of its predecessor by enacting the Magistrates Act, and particularly \xc2\xa7 636(b) thereof, Congress made clear its intent to eliminate that restriction.  Thus, while <em>Hayman</em> may speak in terms of a "commissioner," Congress changed not only the title of that office, but also the qualifications for and the functions of the office.</p>\n<p>Section 636(b) permits federal magistrates to "be assigned . . . such additional duties as are not inconsistent with the Constitution and laws of the United States."  The section then sets forth in three subdivisions certain duties which district courts may authorize by rule, but the duties "are not restricted to" those set forth.  The third illustrative subdivision provides that district courts may authorize the additional duty of</p>\n<p>"preliminary review of applications for post-trial relief made by individuals convicted of criminal offenses, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="481">Page 418 U. S. 481</a></p><p> and submission of a report and recommendations to facilitate the decision of the district judge having jurisdiction over the case as to whether there should be a hearing."</p>\n<p>28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(b)(3).</p>\n<p>Subdivision (3), suggesting additional duties that may be assigned to a magistrate in connection with federal habeas corpus cases, does not, by its terms, permit magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings, but that subdivision is merely illustrative, not exclusive.</p>\n<p>"The mention of these three categories is intended to illustrate the general character of duties assignable to magistrates under the act, rather than to constitute an exclusive specification of duties so assignable."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 25 (1967).  The House Report virtually tracks the language of the Senate Report. H.R.Rep. No. 1629, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 19 (1968).  Thus, there being no constitutional barrier to permitting magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings, [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>] nor any other legal barrier, <em>see</em> <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#476">418 U. S. </a></span> <em>supra,</em> \xc2\xa7 636(b) enables district courts, as did the District Court here, to establish rules which so permit.</p>\n<p>Assuming, <em>arguendo,</em> that \xc2\xa7 2243 does constitute a possible legal barrier to such rules, the legislative history of the Act reveals Congress to have intended the elimination of that barrier.  The Court determines, in the second stage of its analysis, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#469">418 U. S. 469</a></span>-473, that Congress intended the opposite result, but, in this matter, the Court\'s perception is less than discriminating.  The linchpin of the Court\'s argument is the drafting evolution of the terms of subdivision (3), quoted above.  In the change of language from preliminary "consideration" to preliminary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="482">Page 418 U. S. 482</a></p><p> "review," [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] and in the addition of "as to whether there should be a hearing," [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] the Court finds an intent to bar magistrates from conducting a hearing.  But the language changes in the subdivision were made only due to a fear that magistrates would be thought to have been given final adjudicatory power, not to preclude them from conducting hearings when the district judges retained such power. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  Indeed, the latter was specifically intended.  As the Senate Report stated, \xc2\xa7 636(b)</p>\n<p>"contemplates assignments to magistrates under circumstances </p><p><a class="page-number" name="483">Page 418 U. S. 483</a></p><p> where the ultimate decision of the case is reserved to the judge. . . ."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1967).  The concern about enabling magistrates to make the ultimate decision found early expression in the Senate hearings on the bill in a colloquy between Senator Tydings and then Assistant Attorney General Vinson.  Mr. Vinson ultimately revealed his real concern in a letter to the Subcommittee that subdivision (3) as originally drafted would give the power of ultimate decision to the magistrate:  "[I]f preliminary consideration is intended to involve adjudication, it should be handled by an Article 3 Judge."  Hearings 130.  That the Senate viewed Mr. Vinson\'s objections in this light is made clear by Senator Tydings\' testimony in the hearings before a subcommittee of the House Judiciary Committee.  Hearings on S. 945 <em>et al.</em> before Subcommittee No. 4 of the House Committee on the Judiciary, 90th Cong., 2d Sess., 72 (1968).</p>\n<p>In response to this objection, Senator Tydings stated to Mr. Vinson at the Senate hearings:</p>\n<p>"We wouldn\'t intend for the final decision to be made by the magistrate.  <em>But we would intend that . . . the magistrate [be able to] hold a preliminary [habeas] hearing.</em> . . .  We certainly intend that."</p>\n<p>Hearings 112.  (Emphasis added.)  Numerous other witnesses at the Senate hearings urged that the magistrates be permitted to hold hearings.  <em>See,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 418 U. S. 484</a></p><p> <em>e.g., id.</em> at 52 (Chief Judge Northrop, <em>supra,</em> <l=|418 3|="" 461fn2="" u.s.="">n. 3); <em>id.</em> at 94 (Chief Judge Walter E. Hoffman, of the Eastern District of Virginia).</l=|418></p>\n<p>As the Court points out, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#470">418 U. S. 470</a></span>-471, the Judicial Conference objected to the original draft bill (S. 3475), but it did not originally object to subdivision (3), as the Court states.  Instead, the Conference objected to \xc2\xa7 636(b) altogether, fearing it so broad as to be subject to constitutional attack.  Although not specified, it seems clear that, by speaking in terms of "delegation," the Conference initially shared Mr. Vinson\'s concern about delegating the ultimate decisionmaking power of Art. III judges.  Hearings 241n.  The Judicial Conference therefore recommended both a modified version of \xc2\xa7 636(b) and the complete elimination of all three subdivisions.  <em>Ibid.</em>  When the revised draft bill (S. 945), which ultimately was enacted, was introduced, it did not follow the Judicial Conference recommendation, but continued to include the three subdivisions.  As to subdivision (3), the Judicial Conference recommended the addition of the phrase "as to whether there should be a hearing," <em>see</em> <l=|418 461fn2="" 7|="" u.s.="">n. 7, <em>supra,</em> but again stressed that its concern was, as with S. 3475, over the "delegation to magistrates."  Hearings 245.</l=|418></p>\n<p>The tension established in this evolution is clear.  On the one hand, Congress sought to enable district court to authorize magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings.  On the other hand, there was apprehension that the power of authorization granted to district courts might lead to a rule permitting magistrates to exercise ultimate decisionmaking power reserved exclusively to Art. III judges.  To avoid the latter but accomplish the former, Congress persisted in retaining the broad language of \xc2\xa7 636(b), and in retaining subdivision (3).  Not only, as set </p><p><a class="page-number" name="485">Page 418 U. S. 485</a></p><p> forth earlier, does the subdivision not limit the subsection, it was drafted in language to insure that it could not be read to preclude authorizing magistrates to conduct hearings in federal habeas corpus cases. [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Plainly, Congress could have used language that expressly precluded the latter.  That this was not urged upon Congress by anyone, including the Judicial Conference, and that Congress did not include such language, alone suggests its intention to vest in district courts the power to authorize magistrates to hold hearings.  Conversely, Congress would have taken certain risks had it expressly permitted magistrates to hold hearings, as revealed by the following colloquy between Chief Judge Hoffman and Senator Tydings at the Senate hearings:</p>\n<p>"Judge Hoffman.  . . . And I have suggested in my statement . . . that the Federal magistrate could be assigned the task as a master to conduct plenary hearings.  After all, [habeas corpus proceedings] are civil proceedings . . . not criminal proceedings."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Senator Tydings.  [S]ince we . . . don\'t have [in \xc2\xa7 636(b)] \'Including hearings\' or \'Including plenary hearings,\' or \'including the conducting of plenary hearings,\' it is not what we should have?"</p>\n<p>"Judge Hoffman.  I am fearful that someone will say that this is merely an effort on the part of the judge to delegate his judicial function."</p>\n<p>"Senator Tydings.  I think that is a good point, Judge Hoffman."</p>\n<p>Hearings 93-94.</p>\n<p>In light of the need for Congress to avoid language suggesting an unconstitutional delegation of a judicial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="486">Page 418 U. S. 486</a></p><p> function to a magistrate, the ambiguous provision of \xc2\xa7 636(b) -- unlimited by the provisions of subdivision (3) -- should be interpreted to permit magistrates to conduct evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus cases, \xc2\xa7 2243 notwithstanding, because (1) to the extent the subject was expressly discussed in the legislative history, such permission was intended, and (2) such an interpretation would serve the two principal objectives of the Act.  <em>See</em> nn. <l=|418 2|="" 461fn2="" u.s.="">2 and <l=|418 3|="" 461fn2="" u.s.="">3, <em>supra.</em></l=|418></l=|418></p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The final limitation of the Act, that additional duties assigned to magistrates must not be "inconsistent with the Constitution," needs little discussion here.  The Court does not suggest that the conduct of an evidentiary hearing, where the district judge retains the power to make the final decision on an application for a writ of habeas corpus, would be unconstitutional either under Art. III or as a matter of due process of law.  Where this situation obtains, the magistrate\'s conduct of the hearing would be clearly constitutional. [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="487">Page 418 U. S. 487</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Not only would his report and recommendation to the district judge be subject to amendment or outright rejection, the district judge could, at the behest of the habeas corpus petitioner or on his own motion, conduct his own evidentiary hearing to judge for himself, for example, the credibility of witnesses if he deems their testimony essential to disposition of the application.  To the extent a problem of constitutional magnitude may be foreseen in the particulars of the rules established by a district court, those rules can be construed to comport with constitutional requirements.  In any event, now that the Court has construed the Magistrates Act contrary to a clear legislative intent, it is for the Congress to act to restate its intentions if its declared objectives are to be carried out.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Two Circuits have ruled that federal magistrates may conduct evidentiary hearings in federal habeas corpus cases, <em>O\'Shea v. United States,</em> 491 F.2d 774, 778 (CA1 1974); <em>Noorlander v. Ciccone,</em> 489 F.2d 642, 648 (CA8 1973); <em>cf. Campbell v. U.S. District Court,</em> 501 F.2d 196, 205 (CA9 1974), while two Circuits have assumed magistrates have that power, <em>United States ex rel. Gonzalez v.

Wainwright,</em> 464 F.2d 735, 736 (CA5 1972).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court makes clear, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#473">418 U. S. 473</a></span> n. 18, that it sees the function of the magistrate in dealing with habeas corpus petitions as being no more than that previously performed by law clerks.  As Chief Judge Theodore Levin, of the Eastern District of Michigan, testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee\'s Subcommittee on Improvements in Judicial Machinery, which, under the chairmanship of Senator Joseph D. Tydings, began the investigative hearings in 1965 which led to the enactment of the Act three years later, law clerks are not overworked, and are better able to perform such tasks.</p>\n<p>"In any event, this is a somewhat tedious job . . . and is not a function likely to entice a seasoned and competent lawyer to accept a magistrate\'s job."</p>\n<p>Hearings on S. 3475 and S. 945, 89th Cong., 2d Sess. (1966) and 90th Cong., 1st Sess. (1967), p. 61 (hereinafter Hearings).  The Act specifically sought to make "the position [of magistrate] more attractive to highly qualified individuals."  S.Rep. No. 371, 90th Cong., 1st Sess., 11 (1967).  The Department of Justice agreed that such a limited function would be inconsistent with the Act\'s purpose, Hearings 130, and Chief Judge Robert C. Belloni and Dean Robert B. Yegge have noted that the magistrates "should not be simply high-paid law clerks."  Reports of the Conference for District Court Judges, 59 F.R.D. 203, 221 (1973).  To limit a magistrate to a law clerk\'s function surely undercuts what Senator Tydings stated to be</p>\n<p>"[t]he first goal of the Magistrates Act . . . to [give the magistrate] qualifications and a stature higher than those of the present U.S. commissioner."</p>\n<p>Hearings 26.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>No one would dispute the heavy burden on district courts represented by the applications for habeas corpus writs they receive, a large volume of which has been long recognized as "repetitious and patently frivolous."  <em>United States v. Hayman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/case.html">342 U. S. 205</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/205/case.html#212">342 U. S. 212</a></span> (1952) (footnote omitted).  The Court would minimize the burden of these applications at the evidentiary hearing stage, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#473">418 U. S. 473</a></span> n. 20, but the beguiling simplicity of its statistical analysis obscures reality, and is antagonistic to the interests of habeas petitioners.  First, to average hearing days per judge per year evenly across the country fails to recognize the uneven number of habeas corpus applications received by the various district courts.  In his testimony at the Senate hearings on the bill, Chief Judge Edward S. Northrop, of the District of Maryland, reflected the unevenness experienced by his court, which at one time handled more "State prisoner habeas corpus petitions . . . than any other district in the country."  Hearings 52.  Clearly Chief Judge Northrop\'s burden would have exceeded "1.5 hearing days . . . per year."  Second, the habeas corpus applications which ultimately reach the hearing stage do not represent all those which might warrant a hearing.  Senator Tydings stated:</p>\n<p>"We say that the magistrate should be able to [hold] plenary, discovery hearings.  Now, what happens . . . , as a practical matter, you get no hearings.  The law clerk reviews the papers . . . so we are giving the individual [petitioner] actually an opportunity . . . for more consideration than he gets now."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 113.  Finally, even if no more applications would warrant an evidentiary hearing, given the other burdens on district judges those applications which would warrant hearings would receive more prompt attention if magistrates were to hold them.  The virtues of speedy justice need not be elaborated here.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>As noted in  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#480">418 U.

Both references are mistakenly addressed to final decisionmaking power, not the power to conduct hearings where the district judge makes the ultimate decision.  The Note itself concedes that "[i]t is possible to argue [under \xc2\xa7 636(b)] that a plan to have magistrates actually hear cases is valid under the Act."  <em>Id.</em> at 1189 n. 229.  It then argues the other way in reference to matters as to which magistrates have final power of decision.  <em>See</em> 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(a)(3).  That is the only power of magistrates circumscribed by the procedures to which the Court refers, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#470">418 U.

To the extent the Court goes beyond the Note and argues that magistrates\' service as special masters, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(b)(1), is limited by Fed.Rule Civ.Proc. 53(b), the early strictures upon employing special masters were developed before the existence of the judicial office of magistrate, and arguably should not be applied to that new office.  <em>See generally</em> Comment, An Adjudicative Role for Federal Magistrates in Civil Cases, 40 U.Chi.L.Rev. 584 (1973).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Even counsel for respondent agrees (contrary to the Court\'s conclusion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/461/case.html#470">418 U.

So, too, would the Judicial Conference appear to be in agreement.  Proposed Amendments to the Proposed Rules Governing Habeas Corpus Proceedings for the United States District Courts, Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure, Rule 11 (Preliminary Draft, Jan.1973).  Congress has given the magistrates power to conduct trials of a limited nature, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 636(a)(3), which grant of power, carefully limited, appears not to contravene any constitutional prohibition.  <em>Cf.
