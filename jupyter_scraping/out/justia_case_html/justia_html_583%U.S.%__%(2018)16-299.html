Section \xc2\xa71311(a) contains important exceptions to the general prohibition on discharge of pollutants, including two permitting schemes that authorize certain entities to discharge pollutants into navigable waters: the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) under \xc2\xa71342, and a program administered by the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) under \xc2\xa71344.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d delineates the geographic reach of those permitting programs as well as other substantive provisions of the Act.

Generally, parties may file challenges to final EPA actions in federal district courts, typically under the Administrative Procedure Act.  But the Clean Water Act enumerates seven categories of EPA actions for which review lies directly and exclusively in the federal courts of appeals, including, as relevant here, EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9capproving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E), and EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cissuing or denying any permit under section 1342,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(F). </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Several parties, including petitioner National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), challenged the Rule in United States District Courts across the country.  Many parties, but not NAM, filed \xe2\x80\x9cprotective\xe2\x80\x9d petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals to preserve their challenges should their District Court lawsuits be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71369(b).  The circuit-court actions were consolidated and transferred to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  Meanwhile, the parallel actions in the District Courts continued.  NAM intervened as a respondent in the Sixth Circuit and, along with several other parties, moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.  The Government opposed those motions, arguing that the challenges must be brought first in the Court of Appeals because the WOTUS Rule fell within subparagraphs (E) and (F) of \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  The Sixth Circuit denied the motions to dismiss.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Because the WOTUS Rule falls outside the ambit of \xc2\xa71369(b)(1), challenges to the Rule must be filed in federal district courts.

Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(1)\xc2\xa0Subparagraph (E) grants courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review any EPA action \xe2\x80\x9cin approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E).  The WOTUS Rule does not fall within that provision.  To begin, the Rule is not an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d which the Act defines as \xe2\x80\x9cany restriction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on quantities, rates, and concentrations\xe2\x80\x9d of certain pollutants \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(11).  The WOTUS Rule imposes no such restriction; instead, it announces a regulatory definition for a statutory term.  Nor does the Rule fit within subparagraph (E)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d language.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation or other limitation\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that an \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d must be similar in kind to an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation\xe2\x80\x9d: that is, a limitation related to the discharge of pollutants.  This natural reading is reinforced by subparagraph (E)\xe2\x80\x99s cross-references to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311, 1312, 1316, and 1345, which each impose restrictions on the discharge of certain pollutants.  The statutory structure thus confirms that an \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d must also be some type of restriction on the discharge of pollutants.  Because the WOTUS Rule does no such thing, it falls outside the scope of subparagraph (E).  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Even if the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation or other limitation\xe2\x80\x9d were accepted, however, the Rule still does not fall within subparagraph (E) because it is not a limitation promulgated or approved \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311.\xe2\x80\x9d  As subparagraph (E)\xe2\x80\x99s statutory context makes clear, this phrase is most naturally read to mean that the effluent or other limitation must be approved or promulgated \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the authority of\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71311.  But the EPA did not promulgate or approve the WOTUS Rule under \xc2\xa71311, which neither directs nor authorizes the EPA to<i> define</i> a statutory phrase appearing elsewhere in the Act.  Rather, the WOTUS Rule was promulgated or approved under \xc2\xa71361(a), which grants the EPA general rulemaking authority \xe2\x80\x9cto prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out [its] functions under\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Government contends that the statutory language \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311\xe2\x80\x9d poses no barrier to its reading of subparagraph (E) because the WOTUS Rule\xe2\x80\x99s practical effect is to make \xc2\xa71311\xe2\x80\x99s limitations applicable to the waters covered by the Rule.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpractical effects\xe2\x80\x9d test is not grounded in the statute, renders other statutory language superfluous, and ignores Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to grant courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction only over seven enumerated types of EPA actions set forth in \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(2)\xc2\xa0The Government fares no better under subparagraph (F), which grants courts of appeals exclusive and original jurisdiction to review any EPA action \xe2\x80\x9cin issuing or denying any permit under section 1342.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(F).  That provision does not cover the WOTUS Rule, which neither issues nor denies NPDES permits issued under \xc2\xa71342.  Seeking to avoid that conclusion, the Government invokes this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Crown Simpson Pulp Co.</i> v. <i>Costle</i>,\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193\n, and argues that the WOTUS Rule falls under subparagraph (F) because it is \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally similar\xe2\x80\x9d to issuing or denying a permit.  But that construction misconstrues <i>Crown Simpson,</i> is unmoored from the statutory text, and would create surplusage in other parts of the statute.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments provide no basis to depart from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.  First, the Government contends that initial circuit-court review of the WOTUS Rule would avoid a bifurcated judicial-review scheme under which courts of appeals would review individual actions issuing or denying permits, whereas district courts would review broader regulations governing those actions.  But, as explained, Congress has made clear that rules like the WOTUS Rule must be reviewed first in federal district courts.  <i>Crown Simpson, </i>445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197, distinguished.  Moreover, the bifurcation that the Government bemoans is no more irrational than Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice to assign challenges to NPDES permits to circuit courts and challenges to \xc2\xa71344 permits to district courts, see \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E).  And many of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions regarding the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 application and definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d have originated in district courts, not the courts of appeals.  Second, the Court acknowledges that, as the Government argues, routing WOTUS Rule challenges directly to the courts of appeals may improve judicial efficiency.  But efficiency was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 only consideration.  Had Congress wanted to prioritize efficiency, it could have authorized direct circuit-court review of all nationally applicable regulations, as it did under the Clean Air Act, instead of structuring judicial review as it did in \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  Third, the Government argues that initial review in the courts of appeals promotes the important goal of national uniformity with regard to broad regulations.  Although that argument carries some logical force, Congress did not pursue that end at all costs.  Finally, contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s contention, the presumption favoring court-of-appeals review of administrative action does not apply here, for the scope of subparagraphs (E) and (F) is set forth clearly in the statute.  <i>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</i> v. <i>Lorion</i>,\n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 729\n, distinguished.

As it turns out, defining that statutory phrase\xe2\x80\x94a central component of the Clean Water Act\xe2\x80\x94is a contentious and difficult task.  In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) tried their hand at proffering a definition through an agency regulation dubbed the Waters of the United States Rule (WOTUS Rule or Rule).[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  The WOTUS Rule prompted several parties, including petitioner National Association of Manufacturers (NAM), to challenge the regulation in federal court.  This case, however, is not about the substantive challenges to the WOTUS Rule.  Rather, it is about in which federal court<i> </i>those challenges must be filed.</p><p>There are two principal avenues of judicial review of an  </p><p>action by the EPA.  Generally, parties may file challenges to final EPA actions in federal district courts, ordinarily under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).  But the Clean Water Act (or Act) enumerates seven categories of EPA actions for which review lies directly and exclusively in the federal courts of appeals.  See86Stat.892, as amended,33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  The Government contends that the WOTUS Rule fits within two of those enumerated categories: (1) EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cin approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345,\xe2\x80\x9d33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E), and (2) EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cin issuing or denying any permit under section 1342,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(F).</p><p>We disagree.

The Court reviews below the aspects of that scheme that are relevant to the question at hand.</p><p>1</p><p>Congress enacted the Clean Water Act in 1972 \xe2\x80\x9cto restore and maintain the chemical, physical, and biological integrity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71251(a).  One of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal tools in achieving that objective is \xc2\xa71311(a), which prohibits \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person,\xe2\x80\x9d except in express circumstances.  A \xe2\x80\x9cdischarge of a pollutant\xe2\x80\x9d is defined broadly to include \xe2\x80\x9cany addition of any pollutant to navigable waters from any point source,\xe2\x80\x9d such as a pipe, ditch, or other \xe2\x80\x9cdiscernible, confined and discrete conveyance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71362(12), (14).  And \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d in turn, means \xe2\x80\x9cthe waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(7).  Because many of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions apply to \xe2\x80\x9cnavigable waters,\xe2\x80\x9d the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d circumscribes the geographic scope of the Act in certain respects.</p><p>Section 1311(a) contains important exceptions to the prohibition on discharge of pollutants.  Among them are two permitting schemes that authorize certain entities to discharge pollutants into navigable waters.  See <i>Rapanos </i>v. <i>United States</i>,547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 715,723 (2006) (plurality opinion).  The first is the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) program, which is administered by the EPA under \xc2\xa71342.  Under that program, the EPA issues permits allowing persons to discharge pollutants that can wash downstream \xe2\x80\x9cupon [the] condition that such discharge will meet .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. all applicable requirements under sections 1311, 1312, 1316, 1317, 1318, and 1343.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71342(a)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cNPDES permits impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants, and establish related monitoring and reporting requirements, in order to improve the cleanliness and safety of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Friends of the Earth, Inc.</i> v. <i>Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc.</i>,528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167,174 (2000).  One such limitation is an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d defined in the Act as a \xe2\x80\x9crestriction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on quantities, rates, and concentrations\xe2\x80\x9d of specified pollutants \xe2\x80\x9cdischarged from point sources into navigable waters, the waters of the contiguous zone, or the ocean, including schedules of compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(11).</p><p>The second permitting program, administered by the Corps under \xc2\xa71344, authorizes discharges of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dredged or fill material,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9care solids that do not readily wash downstream.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rapanos</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 723 (plurality opinion).  Although the Corps bears primary responsibility in determining whether to issue a \xc2\xa71344 permit, the EPA retains authority to veto the specification of a site for discharge of fill material.  See \xc2\xa71344(c).[<a href="#F2">2</a>]</p><p>2</p><p>The statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d delineates the geographic reach of many of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions, including the two permitting programs outlined above.  In decades past, the EPA and the Corps (collectively, the agencies) have struggled to define and apply that statutory term.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, 42 Fed. Reg. 37124, 37127 (1977); 51 Fed. Reg. 41216\xe2\x80\x9341217 (1986).  And this Court, in turn, has considered those regulatory efforts on several occasions, upholding one such effort as a permissible interpretation of the statute but striking down two others as overbroad.  Compare <i>United States</i> v. <i>Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.</i>,474 U.\xc2\xa0S. 121 (1985) (upholding the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation that \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d include wetlands adjacent to navigable waters), with <i>Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook Cty.</i> v. <i>Army Corps of Engineers</i>,531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 159 (2001) (rejecting application of the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d as applied to sand and gravel pit); and <i>Rapanos</i>, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 729, 757 (plurality opinion) (remanding for further review the Corps\xe2\x80\x99 application of the Act to wetlands lying \xe2\x80\x9cnear ditches or man-made drains that eventually empty into traditional navigable waters\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>In 2015, responding to repeated calls for a more precise definition of \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d the agencies jointly promulgated the WOTUS Rule.  80 Fed. Reg. 37054 (final rule).

To that end, the Rule separates waters into three jurisdictional groups\xe2\x80\x94waters that are categorically jurisdictional (<i>e.g.</i>, interstate waters); those that require a case-specific showing of their significant nexus to traditionally covered waters (<i>e.g.</i>, waters lying in the flood plain of interstate waters); and those that are categorically excluded from jurisdiction (<i>e.g., </i>swimming pools and puddles).  See 33 CFR \xc2\xa7328.3 (2017); 80 Fed. Reg. 37057.  Although the revised regulatory definition \xe2\x80\x9capplies broadly to [the Act\xe2\x80\x99s] programs,\xe2\x80\x9d the WOTUS Rule itself states that it \xe2\x80\x9cimposes no enforceable duty on any state, local, or tribal governments, or the private sector.\xe2\x80\x9d  80 Fed. Reg. 37102.  Indeed, the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s preamble states that it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not establish any regulatory requirements\xe2\x80\x9d and is instead \xe2\x80\x9ca definitional rule that clarifies the scope of\xe2\x80\x9d the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 37054.</p><p>B</p><p>As noted above, the Act contemplates two primary avenues for judicial review of EPA actions, each with its own unique set of procedural provisions and statutes of limitations.

The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (JPML) denied the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request to consolidate and transfer those actions to a single district court.  See Order Denying Transfer in <i>In re Clean Water Rule</i>, MDL No. 2663, Doc. 163 (Oct. 13, 2015).</p><p>Uncertainty surrounding the scope of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s judicial-review provision had also prompted many parties\xe2\x80\x94but not NAM\xe2\x80\x94to file \xe2\x80\x9cprotective\xe2\x80\x9d petitions for review in various Courts of Appeals to preserve their challenges in the event that their District Court lawsuits were dismissed for lack of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa71369(b).  The JPML consolidated these appellate-court actions and transferred them to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit.  See Consolidation Order in <i>In\xc2\xa0re EPA and Dept. of Defense Final Rule</i>, MCP No. 135, Doc. 3 (July 28, 2015).  The Court of Appeals thereafter issued a nationwide stay of the WOTUS Rule pending further proceedings.  See <i>In\xc2\xa0re EPA and Dept. of Defense Final Rule</i>, 803 F.\xc2\xa03d 804 (CA6 2015).</p><p>Meanwhile, parallel litigation continued in the District Courts.  Some District Courts dismissed the pending lawsuits, concluding that the courts of appeals had exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to the Rule.  See <i>Murray Energy Corp. </i>v. <i>EPA</i>, 2015 WL 5062506, *6 (ND W.\xc2\xa0Va., Aug. 26, 2015) (dismissing for lack of jurisdiction); <i>Georgia </i>v. <i>McCarthy</i>, 2015 WL 5092568, *3 (SD Ga., Aug. 27, 2015) (concluding that court lacked jurisdiction to enter preliminary injunction).  One District Court, by contrast, held that it had jurisdiction to review the WOTUS Rule.  See <i>North Dakota</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 127 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 1047, 1052\xe2\x80\x931053 (ND 2015).</p><p>NAM intentionally did not file a protective petition in any court of appeals to \xe2\x80\x9censure that [it] could challenge the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 1, n.\xc2\xa01.  Instead, NAM intervened as a respondent in the Sixth Circuit and, along with several other parties, moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  The Government opposed those motions, arguing that challenges to the WOTUS Rule must be brought first in the Court of Appeals because the Rule fell within subparagraphs (E) and (F) of \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  The Court of Appeals denied the motions to dismiss in a fractured decision that resulted in three separate opinions.  <i>In\xc2\xa0re Dept. of Defense</i>, 817 F.\xc2\xa03d 261 (2016).<i> </i>The Court of Appeals denied rehearing en banc.

Of those seven, only two are at issue in this case: subparagraph (E), which encompasses actions \xe2\x80\x9capproving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E), and subparagraph (F), which covers actions \xe2\x80\x9cissuing or denying any [NPDES] permit,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(F).[<a href="#F6">6</a>]  We address each of those statutory provisions in turn.</p><p>A</p><p>Subparagraph (E) grants courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review any EPA action \xe2\x80\x9cin approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, 1312, 1316, or 1345.\xe2\x80\x9d33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E).  The Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9cEPA\xe2\x80\x99s action in issuing the\xe2\x80\x9d WOTUS Rule \xe2\x80\x9creadily qualifies as an action promulgating or approving an \xe2\x80\x98other limitation\xe2\x80\x99 under section 1311,\xe2\x80\x9d because the Rule establishes the \xe2\x80\x9cgeographic scope of limitations promulgated under Section 1311.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondents 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  We disagree.</p><p>To begin, the WOTUS Rule is not an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a conclusion the Government does not meaningfully </p><p>dispute.  An \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cany restriction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on quantities, rates, and concentrations\xe2\x80\x9d of certain pollutants \xe2\x80\x9cwhich are discharged from point sources into navigable waters.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71362(11).  The WOTUS Rule imposes no such restriction.  Rather, the Rule announces a regulatory definition for a statutory term and \xe2\x80\x9cimposes no enforceable duty\xe2\x80\x9d on the \xe2\x80\x9cprivate sector.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 80 Fed. Reg. 37102.</p><p>The Government instead maintains that the WOTUS Rule is an \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d under subparagraph (E).  Although the Act provides no express definition of that residual phrase, the text and structure of subparagraph (E) tell us what that language means.  And it is not as broad as the Government insists.</p><p>For starters, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation or other limitation\xe2\x80\x9d in subparagraph (E) suggests that an \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d must be similar in kind to an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation\xe2\x80\x9d: that is, a limitation related to the discharge of pollutants.  An \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d for instance, could be a non-numerical operational practice or an equipment specification that, like an \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d restricts the discharge of pollutants, even though such a limitation would not fall within the precise statu- tory definition of \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation.\xe2\x80\x9d  That subparagraph  (E) cross-references \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71311, 1312, 1316, and 1345 reinforces this natural reading.  The unifying feature among those cross-referenced sections is that they impose restrictions on the discharge of certain pollutants.  See, <i>e.g., </i>33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71311 (imposing general prohibition on \xe2\x80\x9cthe discharge of any pollutant by any person\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71312 (governing \xe2\x80\x9cwater quality related effluent limitations\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71316 (governing national performance standards for new sources of discharges); \xc2\xa71345 (restricting discharges and use of sewage sludge).  In fact, some of those sections give us concrete examples of the type of \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d Congress had in mind.  Section 1311(b)(1)(C) allows the EPA to issue \xe2\x80\x9cany more stringent limitation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d if technology-based effluent limitations cannot \xe2\x80\x9cmeet water quality standards, treatment standards, or schedules of compliance.\xe2\x80\x9d  And \xc2\xa71345(d)(3) provides that, if \xe2\x80\x9cit is not feasible to prescribe or enforce a numerical limitation\xe2\x80\x9d on pollutants in sewage sludge, the EPA may \xe2\x80\x9cpromulgate a design, equipment, management practice, or operational standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  All of this demonstrates that an \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d at a minimum, must also be some type of restriction on the discharge of pollutants.  Because the WOTUS Rule does no such thing, it does not fit within the \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d language of subparagraph (E).</p><p>The Government tries to escape this conclusion by arguing that subparagraph (E) expressly covers \xe2\x80\x9c<i>any</i> effluent limitation or other limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E) (emphasis added), and that the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d makes clear that Congress intended subparagraph (E) to sweep broadly and encompass all EPA actions imposing limitations of any sort under the cross-referenced sections.  True, use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d will sometimes indicate that Congress intended particular statutory text to sweep broadly.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Ali </i>v. <i>Federal Bureau of Prisons</i>,552 U.\xc2\xa0S. 214,220 (2008) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 use of \xe2\x80\x98any\xe2\x80\x99 to modify \xe2\x80\x98other law enforcement officer\xe2\x80\x99 is most naturally read to mean law enforcement officers of whatever kind\xe2\x80\x9d).  But whether it does so necessarily depends on the statutory context, and the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d in this context does not bear the heavy weight the Government puts upon it.  Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d cannot expand the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cother limitation\xe2\x80\x9d beyond those limitations that, like effluent limitations, restrict the discharge of pollutants.  In urging otherwise, the Government reads the words \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation and other\xe2\x80\x9d completely out of the statute and insists that what Congress really meant to say is \xe2\x80\x9cany limitation\xe2\x80\x9d under the cross-referenced sections.  Of course, those are not the words that Congress wrote, and this Court is not free to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite the statute\xe2\x80\x9d to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s liking.  <i>Puerto Rico</i> v. <i>Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 14) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur constitutional structure does not permit this Court to rewrite the statute that Congress has enacted\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p><p>Even if the Court accepted the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitation or other limitation,\xe2\x80\x9d however, the Rule still does not fall within subparagraph (E) because it is not a limitation promulgated or approved \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F7">7</a>]  \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E).  This Court has acknowledged that the word \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cchameleon\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cmust draw its meaning from its context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Kucana</i> v. <i>Holder</i>,558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 233,245 (2010) (internal quotation marks omitted).  With respect to subparagraph (E), the statutory context makes clear that the prepositional phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is most naturally read to mean that the effluent limitation or other limitation must be approved or promulgated \xe2\x80\x9cpursuant to\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of the authority of\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71311.  See <i>St.\xc2\xa0Louis Fuel and Supply Co., Inc. </i>v. <i>FERC</i>, 890 F.\xc2\xa02d 446, 450 (CADC 1989) (R.\xc2\xa0B. Ginsburg, J.)

Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1368 (5th ed. 1979) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cunder\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9caccording to\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, the EPA did not promulgate or approve the WOTUS Rule under \xc2\xa71311.  As noted above, \xc2\xa71311 generally bans the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters absent a permit.  Nowhere does that provision direct or authorize the EPA to<i> define</i> a statutory phrase appearing elsewhere in the Act.  In fact, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d does not appear in \xc2\xa71311 at all.  Rather, the WOTUS Rule was promulgated or approved under \xc2\xa71361(a), which  </p><p>grants the EPA general rulemaking authority \xe2\x80\x9cto prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out [its] functions under\xe2\x80\x9d the Act.  Proving the point, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s own brief cites \xc2\xa71361(a) as the statutory provision that \xe2\x80\x9cauthorized the [EPA] to issue the [WOTUS] Rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondents 17, n.\xc2\xa03.[<a href="#F8">8</a>]</p><p>The Government nonetheless insists that the language \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311\xe2\x80\x9d poses no barrier to its reading of subparagraph (E) because the \xe2\x80\x9c[WOTUS] Rule\xe2\x80\x99s legal and practical effect is to make effluent and other limitations under Section 1311 applicable to the waters that the Rule covers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 28.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpractical-effects\xe2\x80\x9d test is not grounded in the statutory text.  Subparagraph (E) encompasses EPA actions that \xe2\x80\x9capprov[e] or promulgat[e] any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311,\xe2\x80\x9d not EPA actions that have the \xe2\x80\x9clegal or practical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of making such limitations applicable  to certain waters.  Tellingly, the Government offers no<i> </i>textual basis to read its \xe2\x80\x9cpractical-effects\xe2\x80\x9d test into  subparagraph (E).</p><p>Beyond disregarding the statutory text, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s construction also renders other statutory language superfluous.  Take, for instance, subparagraph (E)\xe2\x80\x99s cross-references to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71312 and 1316.  See \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E) (covering EPA action \xe2\x80\x9cin approving or promulgating any effluent limitation or other limitation under section 1311, <i>1312</i>,  </p><p><i>1316</i>, or 1345\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Section 1311(a) authorizes discharges that comply with those two cross-referenced sections.  See \xc2\xa71311(a) (prohibiting discharge of pollutants \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xcept as in compliance with .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sections 1312, 1316 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, EPA actions under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71312 and 1316 also would have a \xe2\x80\x9clegal and practical effect\xe2\x80\x9d on the scope of \xc2\xa71311\xe2\x80\x99s general prohibition of discharges, as the Government contends is the case with the WOTUS Rule.  If, on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, EPA actions under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71312 and 1316 would count as actions \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1311\xe2\x80\x9d sufficient to trigger subparagraph (E), Congress would not have needed to cross-reference \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71312 and 1316 again in subparagraph (E).  That Congress did so undercuts the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9cpractical-effects\xe2\x80\x9d test.</p><p>Similarly, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpractical-effects\xe2\x80\x9d test ignores Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to grant appellate courts exclusive jurisdiction only over seven enumerated types of EPA actions set forth in \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  Section 1313, which governs the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s approval and promulgation of state water-quality standards, is a prime example.  Approving or promulgating state water-quality standards under \xc2\xa71313 also has the \xe2\x80\x9clegal and practical effect\xe2\x80\x9d of requiring that effluent limitations be tailored to meet those standards.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, subparagraph (E) would encompass EPA actions taken under \xc2\xa71313, even though such actions are nowhere listed in \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  Courts are required to give effect to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 express inclusions and exclusions, not disregard them.  See <i>Russello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,464 U.\xc2\xa0S. 16,23 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).</p><p>Accordingly, subparagraph (E) does not confer original and exclusive jurisdiction on courts of appeals to review the WOTUS Rule.</p><p>B</p><p>The Government fares no better under subparagraph (F).  That provision grants courts of appeals exclusive and original jurisdiction to review any EPA action \xe2\x80\x9cin issu- ing or denying any permit under section 1342.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(F).  As explained above, NPDES permits issued under \xc2\xa71342 \xe2\x80\x9cauthoriz[e] the discharge of pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d into certain waters \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with specified conditions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gwaltney of Smithfield, Ltd.</i> v. <i>Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Inc.</i>,484 U.\xc2\xa0S. 49,52 (1987).  The WOTUS Rule neither issues nor denies a permit under the NPDES permitting program.  Because the plain language of subparagraph (F) is \xe2\x80\x9cunambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cour inquiry begins with the statutory text, and ends there as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>BedRoc Limited, LLC</i> v. <i>United States</i>,541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 176,183 (2004) (plurality opinion).</p><p>Rather than confront that statutory text, the Government asks us to ignore it altogether.  To that end, the Government urges us to apply the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional interpretive approach\xe2\x80\x9d that it purports the Court employed in <i>Crown Simpson Pulp Co.</i> v. <i>Costle</i>,445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 193 (1980) (<i>per curiam</i>).  Brief for Federal Respondents 31.  <i>Crown Simpson</i>, the Government says, broadens the statutory inquiry under subparagraph (F) by directing courts to ask whether agency actions are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98functionally similar\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to permit issuances or denials.  Brief for Federal Respondents 33 (quoting <i>Crown Simpson</i>, 445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 196).<i> </i>According to the Government, the WOTUS Rule is \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally similar\xe2\x80\x9d to issuing or denying a permit because it establishes the geographical bounds of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s permitting authority and thereby dictates whether permits may or may not be issued.  We reject this approach because it misconstrues <i>Crown Simpson </i>and ignores the statutory text.</p><p>First, <i>Crown Simpson </i>provides scant support for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s atextual construction of subparagraph (F).  In that case, the Court held that subparagraph (F) conferred jurisdiction over the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s veto of a state-issued permit.  See 445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 196.  The Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen [the] EPA .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. objects to effluent limitations contained in a state-issued permit, the precise effect of its action is to \xe2\x80\x98den[y]\xe2\x80\x99 a permit within the meaning of [subparagraph F].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Contrary to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, the WOTUS Rule in no way resembles the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s veto of a state-issued permit addressed in <i>Crown Simpson</i>.  Although the WOTUS Rule may define a jurisdictional prerequisite of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s authority to issue or deny a permit, the Rule itself makes no decision whatsoever on individual permit applications.  <i>Crown Simpson </i>is therefore inapposite.</p><p>In addition, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s proposed \xe2\x80\x9cfunctional interpretive approach\xe2\x80\x9d is completely unmoored from the statutory text.  As explained above, subparagraph (F) applies only to EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cissuing or denying\xe2\x80\x9d a permit \xe2\x80\x9cunder section 1342.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government invites us to broaden that narrow language to cover any agency action that dictates whether a permit is issued or denied.  Congress easily could have drafted subparagraph (F) in that broad manner.  Indeed, Congress could have said that subparagraph (F) covers EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9crelating to whether a permit is issued or denied,\xe2\x80\x9d or, alternatively, EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cestablishing the boundaries of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s permitting authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Congress chose not to do so.  The Court declines the Government\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to override Congress\xe2\x80\x99 considered choice by rewriting the words of the statute.  See <i>Franklin Cal. Tax-Free Trust</i>, 579 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).</p><p>Finally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of subparagraph (F) would create surplusage in other parts of \xc2\xa71369(b)(1).  Subparagraph (D) is one example.  That provision gives federal appellate courts original jurisdiction to review EPA actions \xe2\x80\x9cmaking any determination as to a State permit program submitted under section 1342(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  Put differently, subparagraph (D) establishes the boundaries of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s permitting authority vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the States.  Under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s functional interpretive approach, however, subparagraph (F) would already reach actions delineating the boundaries of EPA\xe2\x80\x99s permitting authority, thus rendering subparagraph (D) unnecessary.  Absent clear evidence that Congress intended this surplusage, the Court rejects an interpretation of the statute that would render an entire subparagraph meaningless.  As this Court has noted time and time again, the Court is \xe2\x80\x9cobliged to give effect, if possible, to every word Congress used.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reiter</i> v. <i>Sonotone Corp.</i>,442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 330,339 (1979).</p><p>For these reasons, subparagraph (F) does not grant courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the WOTUS Rule in the first instance.</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>Unable to anchor its preferred reading in the statutory text, the Government seeks refuge in a litany of extratextual considerations that it believes support direct circuit-court review of the WOTUS Rule.  Those considerations\xe2\x80\x94alone and in combination\xe2\x80\x94provide no basis to depart from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.</p><p>First, the Government contends that initial circuit-court review of the WOTUS Rule would avoid an irrational bifurcated judicial-review scheme under which federal courts of appeals would review individual actions issuing or denying permits, whereas district courts would review broader regulations governing those actions.  In <i>E.\xc2\xa0I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Co.</i> v. <i>Train</i>,430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 112 (1977), the Court described such a bifurcated regime as a \xe2\x80\x9ctruly perverse situation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>,<i> </i>at 136.  And a few years later, in <i>Crown Simpson</i>, the Court declared that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent a far clearer expression of congressional intent, we are unwilling to read the Act as creating such a seemingly irrational bifurcated system.\xe2\x80\x9d  445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197.  Unlike in <i>Crown</i> <i>Simpson</i>, however, here the Court perceives such a \xe2\x80\x9cclea[r] expression of congressional intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Even if the Court might draft the statute differently, Congress made clear that rules like the WOTUS Rule must be reviewed first in federal district courts.  Moreover, the bifurcation that the Government bemoans is no more irrational than Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice to assign challenges to NPDES permits to circuit courts, and challenges to \xc2\xa71344 permits to district courts.  See33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E).  And notably, many of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent decisions regarding the agencies\xe2\x80\x99 application and definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cwaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d have originated in district courts, not the courts  of appeals.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Army Corps of Engineers</i> v. <i>Hawkes Co.</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016); <i>Sackett</i> v. <i>EPA</i>,566 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120 (2012); <i>Rapanos</i>, 547 U. S., at 729 (plurality opinion).</p><p>Second, and relatedly, the Government argues that immediate court-of-appeals review facilitates quick and orderly resolution of disputes about the WOTUS Rule.  We acknowledge that routing WOTUS Rule challenges di- rectly to the courts of appeals may improve judicial efficiency.  See <i>Crown Simpson</i>, 445 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cthe additional level of judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d that would occur in district courts \xe2\x80\x9cwould likely cause delays in resolving disputes under the Act\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <i>Harrison</i> v. <i>PPG Industries, Inc.</i>,446 U. S. 578,593 (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe most obvious advantage of direct review by a court of appeals is the time saved compared to review by a district court, followed by a second review on appeal\xe2\x80\x9d).  But efficiency was not Congress\xe2\x80\x99 only consideration.  Had Congress wanted to prioritize efficiency, it could have authorized direct circuit-court review of all nationally applicable regulations, as it did under the Clean Air Act.  See42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77607(b)(1) (granting the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit original jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9cany other nationally applicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken, by the Administrator under this chapter\xe2\x80\x9d and granting regional circuits jurisdiction to review \xe2\x80\x9cany other final action of the Administrator under this chapter .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which is locally or regionally applicable\xe2\x80\x9d).  That Congress structured judicial review under the Act differently confirms what the text makes clear\xe2\x80\x94that \xc2\xa71369(b)(1) does not grant courts of appeals original jurisdiction to review many types of EPA action, including the WOTUS Rule.</p><p>Third, the Government contends that \xe2\x80\x9cinitial review in a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d promotes \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[n]ational uniformity, an important goal in dealing with broad regulations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Federal Respondents 35 (quoting <i>National Resources Defense Council </i>v. <i>EPA</i>, 673 F. 2d 400, 405, n.\xc2\xa015 (CADC 1982) (R.\xc2\xa0B. Ginsburg, J.)).  That argument carries some logical force.  After all, the numerous challenges to the WOTUS Rule in this very case were consolidated in one Court of Appeals, avoiding any risk of conflict among other courts of appeals, whereas the same was not true for the challenges filed in district courts, leading to some conflicting outcomes.  But even if Congress sought to ensure national uniformity, it did not pursue that end at all costs.  Although \xc2\xa71369(b)(1) does not authorize immediate  circuit-court review of all national rules under the Act, it does permit federal appellate courts to review directly certain effluent and other limitations and individual permit decisions.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71369(b)(1)(E), (F).  It is true that Congress could have funneled all challenges to national rules to the courts of appeals, but it chose a different tack here:  It carefully enumerated the seven categories  of EPA action for which it wanted immediate circuit- court review and relegated the rest to the jurisdiction of the federal district courts.</p><p>Ultimately, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments do not obscure what the statutory language makes clear: Subparagraphs (E) and (F) do not grant courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review the WOTUS Rule.</p><p>B</p><p>In a final effort to bolster its preferred reading of the Act, the Government invokes the presumption favoring court-of-appeals review of administrative action.  According to the Government, when a direct-review provision like \xc2\xa71369(b)(1) exists, this Court \xe2\x80\x9cwill not presume that Congress intended to depart from the sound policy of placing initial .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. review in the courts of appeals\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]bsent a firm indication that Congress intended to locate initial APA review of agency action in the district courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Florida Power &amp; Light Co.</i> v. <i>Lorion</i>,470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 729,745 (1985).  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <i>Florida Power </i>is misplaced.  Unlike the \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d judicial review provisions at issue in <i>Florida Power</i>, <i>id.</i>,<i> </i>at 737, the scope of subparagraphs (E) and (F) is set forth clearly in the statute.  As the Court recognized in <i>Florida Power</i>, jurisdiction is \xe2\x80\x9cgoverned by the intent of Congress and not by any views we may have about sound policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 746.  Here, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent is clear from the statutory text.[<a href="#F9">9</a>]</p><p>IV</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the judgment  of the Court of Appeals and remand the case with in- structions to dismiss the petitions for review for lack of jurisdiction.</p><p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0We note that some of the parties and the Court of Appeals below refer to the WOTUS Rule as the \xe2\x80\x9cClean Water Rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  Throughout this opinion, we have opted to use the former term in lieu of the latter.</span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T2">2</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Both permitting programs allow the States to operate their own permitting schemes to govern waters within their borders.

In February 2017, the President issued an Executive Order directing the agencies to propose a rule rescinding or revising the WOTUS Rule.  See Exec. Order No. 13778, 82 Fed. Reg. 12497.  On July 27, 2017, the agencies responded to that directive by issuing a proposed rule.  See Definition of \xe2\x80\x9cWaters of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94Recodification of Pre-Existing Rules, 82 Fed. Reg. 34899, 34901\xe2\x80\x9334902.
