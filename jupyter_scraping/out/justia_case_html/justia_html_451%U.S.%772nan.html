The exemption is claimed on both statutory and First Amendment grounds.  The provisions primarily at issue are FUTA\'s \xc2\xa7 3309(b) [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and South Dakota\'s \xc2\xa7 61-1-10.4. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="775">Page 451 U. S. 775</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>FUTA appeared originally as Title IX of the Social Security Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 639, and was enacted in response to the widespread unemployment that accompanied the Great Depression.  It called for a cooperative federal-state program of benefits to unemployed workers. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The Act has undergone a series of amendments that progressively have expanded coverage of the Nation\'s workforce. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>This case concerns one of the more recent of those amendments, namely, that effected by \xc2\xa7 115(b)(1) of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. 94-566, 90 Stat. 2670.  The Secretary of Labor has determined that this statute rendered nonprofit church-related primary and secondary schools subject to FUTA.  The South Dakota authorities went along with that ruling in their interpretation of the State\'s amended statute.  Petitioners are among those religiously affiliated schools so claimed to be required to pay the FUTA and South Dakota taxes.  They contest this construction of the statutes.  They argue also, however, that holding them subject to the taxes would violate both </p><p><a class="page-number" name="776">Page 451 U. S. 776</a></p><p> the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Proper understanding of the effect of the 1976 amendment requires a review of FUTA\'s development.  From 1960 to 1970, FUTA, by \xc2\xa7 3306(c)(8), unrestrictedly excluded from the definition of "employment" all</p>\n<p>"service performed in the employ of a religious, charitable, educational, or other organization described in section 501(c)(3) which is exempt from income tax under section 501(a)."</p>\n<p>Pub.L. 86-778, \xc2\xa7 533, 74 Stat. 984. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Under this definition, nonprofit church-related schools, of course, were exempt from the tax.  A 1970 amendment, however, served to narrow that broad exemption of nonprofit organizations. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  <em>See</em> Employment Security Amendments of 1970, Pub.L. 91-373, \xc2\xa7 104(b)(1), 84 Stat. 697.  The amendment generally required state coverage of employees of nonprofit organizations, state hospitals, and institutions of higher education.  Simultaneously, however, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="777">Page 451 U. S. 777</a></p><p> Congress enacted a new and narrower exemption of nonprofit organizations and governmental entities.  So far as pertinent to this case, that exemption was set forth in a new \xc2\xa7 3309(b), which then provided:</p>\n<p>"This section shall not apply to service performed -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) in the employ of (A) a church or convention or association of churches, or (B) an organization which is operated primarily for religious purposes and which is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches;"</p>\n<p>"(2) by a duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed minister of a church in the exercise of his ministry or by a member of a religious order in the exercise of duties required by such order;"</p>\n<p>"(3) in the employ of a school which is not an institution of higher education. . . ."</p>\n<p>No one, including the Secretary of Labor, disputes that church-run elementary and secondary schools remained exempt under this new \xc2\xa7 3309(b).</p>\n<p>In 1976, Congress again amended the Act.  Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, Pub.L. 9566, \xc2\xa7 115(b)(1), 90 Stat. 2670.  The effect of the 1976 amendment, so far as pertinent to this case, was to eliminate completely the theretofore existing subsection (b)(3). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2), dealing specifically with religious employment, remained unchanged.

In light of the repeal of 3309(b)(3), we think the only services performed in the schools that may reasonably be considered within the scope of the exclusion permitted by 3309(b)(1) are those strictly church duties performed by church employees pursuant to their religious responsibilities within the schools."</p>\n<p>Letter dated April 18, 1978, of Secretary Marshall to the Most Reverend Thomas C.

He notified the States, and they took steps for the collection of unemployment taxes from church-related schools.  <em>See</em> Employment and Training Administration, U.S. Department of Labor, Unemployment Insurance Program Letter No. 3978 (May 30, 1978), reprinted in [1978 Transfer Binder] CCH Unemp.Ins.Rep. \xef\xbf\xbd 21,522.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Both St. Martin and the Academy are members of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and, as such, are organizations exempt from federal income tax under 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 501(c)(3).  St. Martin operates a state-certified elementary Christian day school at Watertown that offers kindergarten through eighth-grade education.  The school, which is not a separate legal entity from the church, is controlled by a Board of Education elected from the local congregation.  The congregation entirely finances the school\'s operation.  The Academy is a state-certified 4-year secondary school at Mobridge, and is owned, supported, and controlled by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="779">Page 451 U. S. 779</a></p><p> Synod.  It also is not separately incorporated.  Approximately half of its students go on to become ministers within the Church.  According to the record, all courses given at St. Martin and at the Academy are taught from a religious point of view based on the Synod\'s scriptural convictions.</p>\n<p>When South Dakota proposed to tax them under \xc2\xa7 61-110.3, petitioners took an administrative appeal.  The Appeals Referee of the State\'s Department of Labor, Unemployment Insurance Division, ruled that service performed by employees of each petitioner was "employment" within the meaning of the statute.  Although finding that the Synod "believes a theological basis exists for their schools" and operates them because it</p>\n<p>"holds the conviction that training of the youth involves both education and religion, and that the two are so closely interwoven they cannot be separated,"</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. A-36, the Referee declined to rule that petitioners were exempt under \xc2\xa7 61-1-10.4, the state analogue to 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3309(b).  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F1" name="T1">1 and <l=|451 a="" u<="">| </l=|451></a><a href="#F1" name="T1">1 and <l=|451 a="" u<="">S. 772fn2|&gt;2, <em>supra.</em>  He ruled that petitioners were not eligible for exemption under \xc2\xa7 61-1-10.4(1)(a) because, in his view, the term "church," as used in that section, referred only to the "individual <em>house of worship\' maintained by a particular congregation."

S. 27</a></span> (1980).  Accordingly, we turn first to he federal statute itself.  From our reading of the legislation and of its history, we conclude that the only reasonable construction of 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1) is one </p><p><a class="page-number" name="781">Page 451 U. S. 781</a></p><p> that exempts petitioners\' church-run schools, and others similarly operated, from mandatory state coverage.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 3309 was added to FUTA in 1970.  Although the legislative history directly discussing the intended coverage of its subsection (b)(1) is limited, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the House Report had the following explanation:</p>\n<p>"This paragraph excludes services of persons where the employer is a church or convention or association of churches, but does not exclude certain services performed for an organization which may be religious in orientation unless it is operated primarily for religious purposes and is operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church (or convention or association of churches).  Thus, the services of the janitor of a church would be excluded, but services of a janitor for a separately incorporated college, although it may be church related, would be covered.  A college devoted primarily to preparing students for the ministry would be exempt, as would a novitiate or a house of study training candidates to become members of religious orders. On the other hand, a church related (separately incorporated) charitable organization (such as, for example, an orphanage or a home for the aged) would not be considered under this paragraph to be operated primarily for religious purposes."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 91-612, p. 44 (1969).  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="782">Page 451 U. S. 782</a></p><p> The Senate Report contained identical language.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 91-752, pp. 48-49 (1970).</p>\n<p>Respondent would read this discussion, as the South Dakota Supreme Court majority did, to mean that Congress in 1970 intended to bring within mandatory state coverage all institutions of higher education, including those with no separate legal existence from the church or churches that operate them, except for the narrow category of seminaries and novitiates.  From this, respondent extrapolates that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1) to be read very narrowly, and that the later 94th Congress, in 1976, similarly intended to include within mandatory state coverage all primary and secondary educational institutions, including those entirely within the internal structure of churches.</p>\n<p>The above quotation from the 1969 House Report and its Senate counterpart, however, are susceptible of a simpler and more reasonable explanation that corresponds directly with the language of the subsection.  Congress drew a distinction between employees "of a church or convention or association of churches," \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(A), on the one hand, and employees of "separately incorporated" organizations, on the other.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 91-612, at 44.  The former uniformly would be excluded from coverage by \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(A), while the latter would be eligible for exclusion under \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(B) only when the organization is "operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  To hold, as respondent </p><p><a class="page-number" name="783">Page 451 U. S. 783</a></p><p> would have us do, that "organization" in subsection (b)(1)(B) also includes a church school that is not separately incorporated would make (b)(1)(A) and (b)(1)(B) redundant.</p>\n<p>The distinction between church schools integrated into a church\'s structure and those separately incorporated is given further credence by the statute\'s use of specific words.  The Department of Labor would interpret the term "church" in \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1) as limited to the actual house of worship used by a congregation.  <em>See</em> Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 115. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  This reading, however, appears to us to deny several of FUTA\'s phrases their intended meaning.  Section 3309(b), exempting "service performed -- (1) in the employ of (A) a church . . . ," is phrased entirely in terms of the nature of the <em>employer,</em> and not in terms of the work performed or the place at which the employee works.  Congress further defined "employer" in \xc2\xa7 3306(a) as "any <em>person who</em> -- . . . paid wages . . . or . . . employed at least one individual" (emphasis added). It defined "employee" as "any individual who, under the usual common law rules applicable in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="784">Page 451 U. S. 784</a></p><p> determining the employer-employee relationship, has the status of an employee."  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3306(i) and 3121(d)(2).  Thus, to hold "church" synonymous solely with a physical building that is a house of worship contradicts the phrasing of the statute. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The word "church" in \xc2\xa7 3309(b) must be construed, instead, to refer to the congregation or the hierarchy itself, that is, the church authorities who conduct the business of hiring, discharging, and directing church employees. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>We conclude that, at the time of its enactment in 1970, \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(A) was meant to apply to schools, like petitioners\', that have no separate legal existence from a church, or, as in the Academy\'s case, from a "convention or association of churches."  As the Referee found, St. Martin directly finances, supervises, and controls its school\'s operations.  The Synod similarly supports and controls the Academy.  Only teachers trained and certified by the Synod may teach at either school, and, again as the Referee found, these teachers, both male and female, "receive a divine, life-long call" to the church.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-38.  Male teachers ("teaching ministers") have equal status in the church and an equal vote on Synod matters, including matters of doctrine, with preaching ministers.  <em>Id.</em> at A-37.  Neither school has a separate legal existence.  Thus, the employees </p><p><a class="page-number" name="785">Page 451 U. S. 785</a></p><p> working within these schools plainly are "in the employ . . . of a church or convention or association of churches. . . ." [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The 1976 Amendments did not alter the scope of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1), either directly or by implication.

[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  There is no indication that Congress, in these references, had in mind the scope of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1) and religious organizations.  Rather, all the evidence demonstrates that it was concerned solely with the then-existing \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3) and secular educational institutions, particularly the public schools.  Furthermore, the reported comments implying total coverage of all educational institutions, as a result of the repeal of the former \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), could not be taken as literally true, because the 1970 Report expressly had noted that a college </p><p><a class="page-number" name="787">Page 451 U.

All institutions of higher education had not been covered by the 1970 Amendments.</p>\n<p>Respondent also relies on a single statistic estimating the number of employees newly to be covered as a result of the repeal of the then \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 94-1265 at 8 (table).  This statistical reference, to the effect that 242,000 employees of nonprofit organizations would be covered by the 1976 repeal of subsection(b)(3), is much too meager to sustain respondent\'s position.  The Committee Report\'s table containing this figure is devoid of any explanation, source, or supporting data.  The South Dakota Supreme Court relied on the figure, however, reasoning that, because it "approximates the total number of teachers in all nonprofit elementary and secondary schools" in 1975, [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] 290 N.W.2d at 849 and n. 5, Congress must have included within that number religious school teachers, who constitute more than half the staff of all private elementary and secondary schools in the United States.  Yet, in repealing \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), Congress intended to include not just full-time teachers, but all <em>employees</em> of the newly covered nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools (custodians, cafeteria workers, nurses, part-time help counselors, etc.).  Thus, the inclusion of all employees in nonprofit private lower schools within the number of persons brought within FUTA by the repeal would far exceed the 242,000 contained in the Report\'s table, rendering it, in our view, of dubious significance for the present issue.</p>\n<p>This legislative history does not reveal any clear intent to repeal \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1) or to alter its meaning.  The Court has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="788">Page 451 U.

This diversity makes it impossible, as Congress perceived, to lay down a single rule to govern all church-related organizations.  Our holding today concerns only schools that have no legal identity separate from a church.  To establish exemption from FUTA, a separately incorporated church school (or other organization) must satisfy the requirements of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(B): (1) that the organization "is operated primarily for religious purposes," and (2) that it is "operated, supervised, controlled, or principally supported by a church or convention or association of churches."</p>\n<p>Because we hold petitioners exempt under \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(A), we leave the issue of coverage under \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(1)(B) for the future.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States strongly urges this construction, noting that the Department of Labor consistently has advanced this meaning of "church" since the 1970 enactment.  <em>See</em> U.S. Department of Labor, Draft Legislation to Implement the Employment Security Amendments of 1970, pp. 27-28.

By repealing \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), Congress removed only one of the two statutory exemptions that, by their terms, applied to employees of parochial elementary and secondary schools.

Marshall,</em> 626 F.2d 366 (CA5 1980), <em>cert. pending,</em> No. 8922.</p>\n<p>When the Court is confronted with the task of construing legislation of this character, there is special force to the rule that the plain statutory language should control, and that resort to legislative history is appropriate only when the statute itself is ambiguous.  Congress has a special duty to choose its words carefully when it is drafting technical and complex laws; we facilitate our work as well as that of Congress when we adhere closely to the statutory text in cases like this. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Failure to follow that approach led this Court into what I regard as manifest error in its recent summary per curiam affirmance in <em>HCSC-Laundry v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/1/case.html">450 U. S. 1</a></span>, a case in which the taxpayer\'s claim for exemption had equally strong support in the statutory text and, in my opinion, greater support in the legislative history than is true here.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/1/case.html#19">450 U. S. 19</a></span>-23 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  Today, although I agree that the Court reaches the result required by the text of the FUTA, I write this separate statement to emphasize that this result is not supported by the legislative history of the 1976 Amendments, nor is it consistent with the Court\'s contrary resolution of the parallel tax exemption issue in <em>HCSC-Laundry.</em></p>\n<p>Accordingly, I concur in the Court\'s judgment.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The House Report states:</p>\n<p>"Section 115(b) also has the effect of requiring the State to pay unemployment compensation on the basis of services performed for all educational institutions.  Under existing law, the State is only required to provide coverage of services performed for institutions of higher education."</p>\n<p>H.R.Rep. No. 94-755, p. 56 (1975).  <em>See also id.</em> at 2, 6, 41.  Similarly, the Senate Report provides:</p>\n<p>"The bill would require the States to extend the coverage of their unemployment compensation programs to employees of nonprofit elementary and secondary schools (present law requires coverage for employees of institutions of higher education)."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 94-1265, p. 2 (1976).  <em>See also id.</em> at 7, 9-11.</p>\n<p>In addition, the legislative history contains several references to the general congressional intention to extend the coverage of the FUTA to substantially all of the Nation\'s wage earners.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> H.R.Rep. No. 94-755, <em>supra,</em> at 1-2; 122 Cong.Rec. 22518-22519 (1976); <em>id.</em> at 22899-22900.  While such general statements of legislative purpose cannot override plain statutory language, <em>see ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html#786">451 U. S. 786</a></span>, n.19, they are nonetheless consistent with the more specific statements of purpose quoted above.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Senate Report estimated that 242,000 additional employees of nonprofit organizations would be covered under the FUTA as a result of the repeal of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3).  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 94-1265, <em>supra,</em> at 8.  This figure approximated the number of full-time teachers in all private, nonprofit elementary and secondary schools in 1975.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html#787">451 U. S. 787</a></span>, n. 20.  Because well over one-half of these teachers were employed in parochial schools, respondent argues that this statistic, although perhaps slightly inaccurate, indicates that Congress intended to extend coverage to employees of parochial elementary and secondary schools.  As the Court notes, the South Dakota Supreme Court accepted this argument.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html#787">451 U. S. 787</a></span>; 290 N.W.2d 845, 849, and n. 5 (1980).</p>\n<p>The Court finds that respondent\'s reliance upon this statistic is misplaced because,</p>\n<p>"in repealing \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), Congress intended to include not just full-time teachers, but all <em>employees</em> of the newly covered nonprofit private elementary and secondary schools."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/772/case.html#787">451 U. S. 787</a></span> (emphasis in original).  The Court\'s observation, however, indicates only that the statistic was factually inaccurate; it does not undercut respondent\'s reliance upon that statistic as a guide to congressional intent.  Whether Congress believed that the figure 242,000 was an estimate of the number of additional teachers that would be covered by the Act as a result of the repeal of \xc2\xa7 3309(b)(3), or an estimate of the number of additional employees that would be so covered, the estimate would have had meaning only if at least some parochial school employees were represented among the 242,000 newly covered individuals.</p>\n<p>It also should be noted that the Secretary of Labor, in his order declining to certify the unemployment compensation programs of the States of Alabama and Nevada under the FUTA, stated that the statistic had been supplied to Congress by the Department of Labor as the then-available best estimate of the total number of employees in all nonprofit, private elementary and secondary schools.  <em>See</em> 44 Fed.Reg. 64378, 6438064382, and n. 16 (1979).  The Secretary also expressly stated that the estimate included employees of church-related elementary and secondary schools.  <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>In light of the fact that approximately 86% of the students, <em>see</em> Rice, Conscientious Objection to Public Education:  The Grievance and the Remedies, 1978 B.Y.U.L.Rev. 847, and over 50% of the teachers in private, nonprofit elementary and secondary schools, are in parochial schools, Congress\' failure to mention any exception for such schools is surely significant.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals in <em>Alabama v. Marshall</em> accurately characterized the judicial function in cases such as this:</p>\n<p>"If Congress desires to change the established exemption of unemployment compensation coverage for elementary and secondary parochial school employees, it is well within its ability to amend the law to reflect that desire by drafting a clear statement to that effect.  But it is not the responsibility or function of this court to perform linguistic gymnastics in order to upset the plain language of Congress as it exists today."</p>\n<p>626 F.2d at 369.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
