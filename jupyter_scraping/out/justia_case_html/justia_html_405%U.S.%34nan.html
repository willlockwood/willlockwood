JUSTICE STEWART delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>When a member of the armed forces has applied for a discharge as a conscientious objector and has exhausted all avenues of administrative relief, it is now settled that he may seek habeas corpus relief in a federal district court on the ground that the denial of his application had no basis in fact.  The question in this case is whether the district court must stay its hand when court-martial proceedings are pending against the serviceman.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Joseph Parisi, was inducted into the Army as a draftee in August, 1968.  Nine months later, he applied for a discharge as a conscientious objector, claiming that earlier doubts about military service had crystallized into a firm conviction that any form of military activity conflicted irreconcilably with his religious beliefs.  He was interviewed by the base chaplain, the base psychiatrist, and a special hearing officer.  They all attested to the petitioner\'s sincerity and to the religious content of his professed beliefs.  In addition, the commanding general of the petitioner\'s Army training center and the commander of the Army hospital recommended that the petitioner be discharged as a conscientious objector.  His immediate commanding officer, an Army captain, disagreed, recommending disapproval of the application on the ground that the petitioner\'s beliefs were based on essentially political, sociological, or philosophical views, or on a merely personal moral code.</p>\n<p>In November, 1969, the Department of the Army denied the petitioner conscientious objector status on the grounds that his professed beliefs had become fixed prior to entering the service and that his opposition to war was not truly based upon his religious beliefs.  On November 24, 1969, the petitioner applied to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records (hereafter </p><p><a class="page-number" name="36">Page 405 U. S. 36</a></p><p> sometimes ABCMR) for administrative review of that determination.</p>\n<p>Four days later, the petitioner commenced the present habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, claiming that the Army\'s denial of his conscientious objector application was without basis in fact.  He sought discharge from the Army and requested a preliminary injunction to prevent his transfer out of the jurisdiction of the District Court and to prohibit further training preparatory to being transferred to Vietnam.  The District Court declined at that time to consider the merits of the habeas corpus petition, but it retained jurisdiction pending a decision by the ABCMR, and in the meantime enjoined Army authorities from requiring the petitioner to participate in activity or training beyond his current noncombatant duties.</p>\n<p>Shortly thereafter the petitioner received orders to report to Fort Lewis, Washington, for deployment to Vietnam, where he was to perform noncombatant duties similar to those that had been assigned to him in this country.  He sought a stay of this redeployment order pending appeal of the denial of habeas corpus, but his application was denied by the Court of Appeals on the condition that the Army would produce him if the appeal should result in his favor.  A similar stay application was subsequently denied by MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS as Ninth Circuit Justice, <em>Parisi v. Davidson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/396/1233/case.html">396 U. S. 1233</a></span>.  The petitioner then reported to Fort Lewis.  He refused, however, to obey a military order to board a plane for Vietnam.  As a result, he was charged with violating Art. 90 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 890, and, on April 8, 1970, a court-martial convicted him of that military offense. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="37">Page 405 U. S. 37</a></p><p></p>\n<p>While the court-martial charges were pending, the Army Board for Correction of Military Records notified the petitioner that it had rejected his application for relief from the Army\'s denial of his conscientious objector application.  The District Court then ordered the Army to show cause why the pending writ of habeas corpus should not issue.  On the Government\'s motion, the District Court, on March 31, 1970, entered an order deferring consideration of the habeas corpus petition until final determination of the criminal charge then pending in the military court system.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed this order, concluding that "habeas proceedings were properly stayed pending the final conclusion of Parisi\'s military trial and his appeals therefrom," 435 F.2d 299, 302.  We granted certiorari, 402 U.S. 942.</p>\n<p>In affirming the stay of the petitioner\'s federal habeas corpus proceeding until completion of the military courts\' action, the Court of Appeals relied on the related doctrines of exhaustion of alternative remedies and comity between the federal civilian courts and the military system of justice.  We hold today that neither of these doctrines required a stay of the habeas corpus proceedings in this case.</p>\n<p>With respect to available administrative remedies, there can be no doubt that the petitioner has fully met the demands of the doctrine of exhaustion -- a doctrine that must be applied in each case with an "understanding of its purposes and of the particular administrative scheme involved."  <em>McKart v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/185/case.html">395 U. S. 185</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/185/case.html#193">395 U. S. 193</a></span>.  The basic purpose of the exhaustion doctrine is to allow an administrative agency to perform functions within its special competence -- to make a factual record, to apply its expertise, and to correct its own errors so as to moot judicial controversies.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/185/case.html#194">395 U. S. 194</a></span>-195; </p><p><a class="page-number" name="38">Page 405 U. S. 38</a></p><p> <em>McGee v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/402/479/case.html">402 U.

(Supp. 1970).  In this case, the petitioner fully complied with Army Regulation 6320, which dictates the procedures to be followed by a serviceman seeking classification as a conscientious objector on the basis of beliefs that develop after induction. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Moreover, following a rule of the Ninth Circuit then in effect, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] he went further and appealed to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The procedures and corrective opportunities </p><p><a class="page-number" name="39">Page 405 U. S. 39</a></p><p> of the military administrative apparatus had thus been wholly utilized at the time the District Court entered its order deferring consideration of the petitioner\'s habeas corpus application.</p>\n<p>It is clear, therefore, that, if the court-martial charge had not intervened, the District Court would have been wrong in not proceeding to an expeditious consideration of the merits of the petitioner\'s claim.  For the writ of habeas corpus has long been recognized as the appropriate remedy for servicemen who claim to be unlawfully retained in the armed forces.  <em>See, e.g., Eagles v. Samuels,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/304/case.html">329 U. S. 304</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/304/case.html#312">329 U. S. 312</a></span>; <em>Oestereich v.

And, as stated at the outset, that writ is available to consider the plea of an in-service applicant for discharge as a conscientious objector who claims that exhaustion of military administrative procedures has led only to a factually baseless denial of his application.  <em>In re Kelly,</em> 401 F.2d 211 (CA5); <em>Hammond v. Lenfest,</em> 398 F.2d 705 (CA2). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>But since a court-martial charge was pending against the petitioner when he ought habeas corpus in March, 1970, the respondents submit that the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that the District Court must </p><p><a class="page-number" name="40">Page 405 U. S. 40</a></p><p> await the final outcome of those charges in the military judicial system before it may consider the merits of the petitioner\'s habeas corpus claim.  Although this argument, too, is framed in terms of "exhaustion," it may more accurately be understood as based upon the appropriate demands of comity between two separate judicial systems. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Requiring the District Court to defer to the military courts in these circumstances serves the interests of comity, the respondents argue, by aiding the military judiciary in its task of maintaining order and discipline in the armed services and by eliminating "needless friction" between the federal civilian and military judicial systems.  The respondents note that the military constitutes a "specialized community governed by a separate discipline from that of the civilian," <em>Orloff v. Willoughby,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/83/case.html">345 U. S. 83</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/83/case.html#94">345 U. S. 94</a></span>; <em>Gusik v. Schilder,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/128/case.html">340 U. S. 128</a></span>, and that, in recognition of the special nature of the military community, Congress has created an autonomous military judicial system, pursuant to Art. I, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="41">Page 405 U. S. 41</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 8, of the Constitution. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  They further point out that civilian courts, out of respect for the separation of powers doctrine and for the needs of the military, have rightly been reluctant to interfere with military judicial proceedings. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>But the issue in this case does not concern a federal district court\'s direct intervention in a case arising in the military court system. <em> Cf. Gusik v. Schilder, supra; Noyd v. Bond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/683/case.html">395 U. S. 683</a></span>.  The petitioner\'s application for an administrative discharge -- upon which the habeas corpus petition was based -- antedated, and was independent of, the military criminal proceedings.</p>\n<p>The question here, therefore, is whether a federal court should postpone adjudication of an independent civil lawsuit clearly within its original jurisdiction.  Under accepted principles of comity, the court should stay its hand only if the relief the petitioner seeks -- discharge as a conscientious objector -- would also be available to him with reasonable promptness and certainty through the machinery of the military judicial system in its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="42">Page 405 U. S. 42</a></p><p> processing of the court-martial charge.  <em>Griffin v. County School Board of Prince Edward County,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/218/case.html">377 U. S. 218</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/377/218/case.html#229">377 U. S. 229</a></span>; <em>Davis v.

For the reasons that follow, we are not persuaded that such relief would be even potentially available, much less that it would be either prompt or certain.</p>\n<p>Courts-martial are not convened to review and rectify administrative denials of conscientious objector claims or to release conscientious objectors from military service.  They are convened to adjudicate charges of criminal violations of military law.  It is true that the Court of Military Appeals has held that a soldier charged in a court-martial with refusal to obey a lawful order may, in certain limited circumstances, defend upon the ground that the order was not lawful because he had wrongfully been denied an administrative discharge as a conscientious objector.  <em>United States v. Noyd,</em> 18 U.S.C.M.A. 483, 40 C.M.R.195. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The scope of the <em>Noyd</em> doctrine is narrow, <em>United States v. Wilson,</em> 19 U.S.C.M.A. 100, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="43">Page 405 U. S. 43</a></p><p> 41 C.M.R. 100, and its present vitality not wholly clear, <em>United States v. Stewart,</em> 20 U.S.C.M.A. 272, 43 C.M.R. 112.  A <em>Noyd</em> defense, therefore, would be available, even arguably, only in an extremely limited category of court-martial proceedings.  But even though we proceed on the assumption that <em>Noyd</em> offered this petitioner a potential affirmative defense to the court-martial charge brought against him, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] the fact remains that the <em>Noyd</em> doctrine offers, at best, no more than a defense to a criminal charge.  Like any other legal or factual defense, it would, if successfully asserted at trial or on appeal, entitle the defendant to only an acquittal [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] -- not to the discharge from military service that he seeks in the habeas corpus proceeding.</p>\n<p>The respondents acknowledge, as they must, the limited function of a <em>Noyd</em> defense in the trial and appeal of the court-martial proceeding itself.  But they suggest that, if the military courts should eventually acquit the petitioner on the ground of his <em>Noyd</em> defense, then the petitioner may have "an available remedy by way of habeas corpus in the Court of Military Appeals." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  In support of this suggestion, the respondents point to the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1651(a), and to cases in which the Court of Military Appeals has exercised </p><p><a class="page-number" name="44">Page 405 U. S. 44</a></p><p> power under that Act to order servicemen released from military imprisonment pending appeals of their court-martial convictions.  <em>See Noyd v. Bond,</em> 395 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/683/case.html#695">395 U. S. 695</a></span>; <em>Levy v. Resor,</em> 17 U.S.C.M.A. 135, 37 C.M.R. 399; <em>United States v. Jennings,</em> 19 U.S.C.M.A. 88, 41 C.M.R. 88; <em>Johnson v. United States,</em> 19 U.S.C.M.A. 407, 42 C.M.R.9.</p>\n<p>But the All Writs Act only empowers courts to "issue all writs necessary or appropriate in aid of their respective jurisdictions . . . ," and the jurisdiction of the Court of Military Appeals is limited by the Uniform Code of Military Justice to considering appeals from court-martial convictions.  10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 867; <em>United States v. Snyder,</em> 18 U.S.C.M.A. 480, 40 C.M.R.192.  That court has been given no "jurisdiction" to consider a serviceman\'s claim for discharge from the military as a conscientious objector.</p>\n<p>Whether this conceptual difficulty might somehow be surmounted is a question for the Court of Military Appeals itself ultimately to decide.  <em>See United States v. Bevilacqua,</em> 18 U.S.C.M.A. 10, 12, 39 C.M.R. 10, 12.  But the short answer to the respondents\' suggestion in this case is the respondents\' own concession that that court has, to date, never so much as intimated that it has power to issue a writ of habeas corpus granting separation from military service to a conscientious objector.  We conclude here, therefore, as in <em>Noyd v. Bond, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/405/676/case.html#698">405 U. S. 698</a></span> n. 11, that the petitioner cannot "properly be required to exhaust a remedy which may not exist." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="45">Page 405 U. S. 45</a></p><p> of the Court of Appeals and remand the case to the District Court with directions to give expeditious consideration to the merits of the petitioner\'s habeas corpus application.</p>\n<p>In holding, as we do today, that the pendency of court-martial proceedings must not delay a federal district court\'s prompt determination of the conscientious objector claim of a serviceman who has exhausted all administrative remedies, we no more than recognize the historic respect in this Nation for valid conscientious objection to military service.  <em>See</em> 50 U.S.C.App. \xc2\xa7 456(j); <em>United States v. Seeger,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/163/case.html">380 U. S. 163</a></span>. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  As the Defense Department itself has recognized, "the Congress . . . has deemed it more essential to respect a man\'s religious beliefs than to force him to serve in the Armed Forces."  Department of Defense Directive No. 1300.6 (May 10, 1968). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="46">Page 405 U. S. 46</a></p><p></p>\n<p>But our decision today should not be understood as impinging upon the basic principles of comity that must prevail between civilian courts and the military judicial system.  <em>See, e.g., Noyd v. Bond,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/683/case.html">395 U. S. 683</a></span>; <em>Burns v.

Accordingly, a federal district court, even though upholding the merits of the conscientious objector claim of a serviceman against whom court-martial charges are pending, should give careful consideration to the appropriate demands of comity in effectuating its habeas corpus decree.

Military courts are legislative courts; their jurisdiction is independent of Art. III judicial power.  Following World War II, Congress, in an attempt to reform and modernize the system of military law, created the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Act of May 5, 1950, c. 169, 64 Stat. 107.  In 1968, the Code was amended by the Military Justice Act, 10 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 819, to improve court-martial and review procedures.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Hammond v.

Noyd\'s commanding officer had refrained from ordering the accused to give such instruction until the application had been processed and denied.  As the Court of Military Appeals said:</p>\n<p>"The validity of the order [to instruct students], therefore, depended upon the validity of the Secretary\'s decision [rejecting the conscientious objector application]. . . .  If the Secretary\'s decision was illegal, the order it generated was also illegal."</p>\n<p><em>United States v.

If the <em>Noyd</em> defense is available, and if the order that the petitioner disobeyed was unlawful if his conscientious objector claim is valid, then allowing him to proceed in federal district court as soon as military administrative remedies have been exhausted does not affect military discipline.  For if the conscientious objector claim is valid, the Army can have no interest in punishing him for disobedience of an unlawful order.  If the conscientious objector claim is invalid, then the Army can, of course, prosecute the petitioner for his alleged disobedience of a lawful order.</p>\n<p>Correlatively, if the charges in military court would be unaffected by the validity of the conscientious objector claim, both the petitioner\'s habeas corpus action and the criminal trial in military court could proceed concurrently.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F15" name="T15">n</a> 15, <em>infra.</em>  Needless to say, the question whether wrongful denial of conscientious objector status may be raised as a defense against various types of military charges must remain with the military courts, as they exercise their special function of administering military law.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See generally</em> Report of the National Advisory Commission on Selective Service, In Pursuit of Equity:  Who Serves When Not All Serve? 48-51 (1967); Selective Service System Monograph No. 11, Conscientious Objection (1950); Russell, Development of Conscientious Objector Recognition in the United States, 20 Geo.Wash.L.Rev. 409 (1952); Comment, God, the Army, and Judicial Review:  The In-Service Conscientious Objector, 56 Calif.L.Rev. 379 (1968).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T15" name="F15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>In the present case, the respondents acknowledge that, if the administrative denial of the petitioner\'s conscientious objector claim had no basis in fact, then the court-martial charge against him is invalid.  It follows that, if he should prevail in the habeas corpus proceeding, he is entitled to his immediate release from the military.  At the other end of the spectrum is the hypothetical case of a court-martial charge that has no real connection with the conscientious objector claim -- <em>e.g.,</em> a charge of stealing a fellow soldier\'s watch.  In such a case, a district court, even though upholding the serviceman\'s conscientious objector claim, might condition its order of discharge upon the completion of the court-martial proceedings and service of any lawful sentence imposed.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring in the result.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court\'s view that habeas corpus is an overriding remedy to test the jurisdiction of the military to try or to detain a person.  The classic case is <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html">Ex parte Milligan,</a></span></em> 4 Wall. 2, where habeas corpus was issued on behalf of a civilian tried and convicted in Indiana by a military tribunal.  During the Civil War, all civil courts in that State were open, and federal authority had always been unopposed.  While the President </p><p><a class="page-number" name="47">Page 405 U. S. 47</a></p><p> and the Congress had "suspended" the writ, <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#115">71 U. S. 115</a></span>, the suspension, said the Court, went no further than to relieve the military from producing in the habeas corpus court the person held or detained.</p>\n<p>"The Constitution goes no further.  It does not say, after a writ of habeas corpus is denied a citizen, that he shall be tried otherwise than by the course of the common law; if it had intended this result, it was easy by the use of direct words to have accomplished it."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#126">71 U. S. 126</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Mr. Chief Justice Taney, in <em>Ex parte Merryman,</em> 17 F.Cas. 144 (No. 9,487) (CC Md. 1861), held that the President alone had no authority to suspend the writ, a position that Lincoln did not honor.  To date, the question has never been resolved, and its decision is not relevant to the present case.  I mention the matter because of the constitutional underpinning of the writ of habeas corpus.  Article I of the Constitution, in describing the powers of the legislative branch, states in \xc2\xa7 9 that:  "The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it."</p>\n<p>The Court has consistently reaffirmed the preferred place of the Great Writ in our constitutional system.  <em>Fay v.

Once, Congress withdrew from this Court its appellate jurisdiction in habeas corpus cases.   <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/73/318/case.html">Ex parte McCardle,</a></span></em> 6 Wall. 318,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/74/506/case.html">74 U.

What federal judges may do, however, is a distinct question.  Authority to protect constitutional rights of individuals is inherent in the authority of a federal judge, conformably with Acts of Congress.  The mandate in Art. I, \xc2\xa7 9, that "The Privilege of the Writ . . . shall not be suspended" must mean that its issuance, in a proper case or controversy, is an implied power of any federal judge.</p>\n<p>We have ruled that, even without congressional statutes enforcing constitutional rights, the federal judges have authority to enforce the federal guarantee.  <em>Fay v.

That principle of comity is important in the operation of our federal system, for both the States and the Federal Government </p><p><a class="page-number" name="51">Page 405 U.

I, \xc2\xa7 9.  Military law is primarily an instrument of discipline, and a "military trial is marked by the age-old manifest destiny of retributive justice."  <em>Id.</em> at 266. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  For the sake of discipline and orderliness, a person in the military service must normally follow the military administrative procedure and exhaust its requirements.  <em>Gusik v.

To repeat, both statutes [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] and the Constitution [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>] are implicated in the claims of conscientious objectors.</p>\n<p>Petitioner claims to be a conscientious objector, and therefore not subject to military orders.  He was charged with refusing to obey a military order sending him to Vietnam, and has been convicted of that offense.  While the court-martial charges against him were pending, he exhausted all administrative remedies for relief from the Army\'s denial of his conscientious objector application.  In theory, he could pursue his remedies within the military system by appealing the conviction or seeking habeas corpus in the Court of Military Appeals.  But he need go no further than to exhaust his administrative remedies for overruling the decision that he was not a conscientious objector.  If there is a statutory or constitutional reason why he should not obey the order of the Army, that agency is overreaching when it punishes him for his refusal.</p>\n<p>The Army has a separate discipline of its own, and obviously it fills a special need.  But matters of the mind and spirit, rooted in the First Amendment, are not in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 405 U. S. 55</a></p><p> keeping of the military.  Civil liberty and the military regime have an "antagonism" that is "irreconcilable."  <em>Ex parte Milligan,</em> 4 Wall. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/71/2/case.html#124">71 U.

When the military steps over those bounds, it leaves the area of its expertise and forsakes its domain.

R. Stern &amp; E. Gressman, Supreme Court Practice 419-420 (4th ed.1969).  But the Court has not settled the question.  <em>See Hirota v.

Some members of the Court have felt that, absent statutory authorization, the Court may not even transfer a petition for an original writ of habeas corpus to a lower court.  But that view has not prevailed.  <em>See Chaapel v. Cochran,</em> 369 U.S. 869.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See Billings v.

This case involved a Selective Service registrant whose conscientious objector claim was rejected by the service.

When Billings refused an order to submit to fingerprinting, military charges were brought against him.</p>\n<p>While the charges were pending, Billings sought federal habeas corpus relief, challenging the military\'s jurisdiction to try him, on the theory that he had not been lawfully inducted.  The District Court discharged the writ, and the Court of Appeals affirmed, but this Court held that Billings\' induction had indeed violated existing statutory law, and ordered that the writ issue.  Implicit in this holding is an affirmation of the proposition that exhaustion of military remedies, including pending court-martial, is not required of one challenging the military\'s jurisdiction to try him in the first instance.</p>\n<p>While <em>Billings</em> was decided before the enactment of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, cases decided under the Code have reached similar results.  <em>See, e.g., McElroy v.

There, the Court was faced with a serviceman who had refused to obey an order because of his asserted conscientious scruples against the war in Vietnam.  His court-martial conviction was pending in the Court of Military Appeals.  The issue decided against him on his federal habeas application, however, was not the jurisdiction of the military to try him in the first instance, but merely his entitlement to bail pending disposition of his military appeals.  The Court held that his bail motion should first be presented to the Court of Military Appeals; but we were explicit in distinguishing <em>Guagliardo, Covert,</em> and <em>Toth:</em></p>\n<p>"The cited cases held that the Constitution barred the assertion of court-martial jurisdiction over various classes of civilians connected with the military, and it is true that this Court there vindicated complainants\' claims without requiring exhaustion of military remedies.  We did so, however, because we did not believe that the expertise of military courts extended to the consideration of constitutional claims of the type presented.  Moreover, it appeared especially unfair to require exhaustion of military remedies when the complainants raised substantial arguments denying the right of the military to try them at all.  Neither of these factors is present in the case before us."</p>\n<p>395 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/683/case.html#696">395 U. S. 696</a></span> n. 8.

Recent attacks have rested on the premise that, in fact, the court has become too closely identified with the viewpoint of the military establishment it is supposed to oversee.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> R. Sherrill, Military Justice Is to Justice as Military Music Is to Music 214-215 (1970).  Critics must concede, however, that the court has at least been partially successful in infusing civilian notions of due process into the military justice system.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> E. Sherman, Justice in the Military, in Conscience and Command 21, 28 (J. Finn ed.1971).  Thus, the court has extended to servicemen the right to a speedy trial, <em>United States v. Schalck,</em> 14 U.S.C.M.A. 371, 34 C.M.R. 151; the right to confront witnesses, <em>United States v. Jacoby,</em> 11 U.S.C.M.A. 428, 29 C.M.R. 244; the right to protection against unreasonable searches and seizures, <em>United States v. Vierra,</em> 14 U.S.C.M.A. 48, 33 C.M.R. 260; the privilege against self-incrimination, <em>United States v. Kemp,</em> 13 U.S.C.M.A. 89, 32 C.M.R. 89; the right to a public trial, <em>United States v. Brown,</em> 7 U.S.C.M.A. 251, 22 C.M.R. 41; the right to compulsory service of process, <em>United States v. Sweeney,</em> 14 U.S.C.M.A. 599, 34 C.M.R. 379; and the right to <em>Miranda</em>-type warnings, <em>United States v. Tempia,</em> 16 U.S.C.M.A. 629, 37 C.M.R.249.</p>\n<p>Despite these advances, however, the military justice system\'s disregard of the constitutional rights of servicemen is pervasive.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Constitutional Rights of Military Personnel before the Subcommittee on Constitutional Rights of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, pursuant to S.Res.

Today, every male resident is a potential soldier, sailor, or airman; and it has been estimated that, even in time of peace, such service occupies at least four percent of the adult life of the average American reaching draft age.
