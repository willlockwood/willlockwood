The region at issue here, which the parties have referred to as the Philadel- phia \xe2\x80\x9ccluster\xe2\x80\x9d or the Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x9cDesignated Market Area\xe2\x80\x9d (DMA), includes 16 counties located in Pennsylvania, Delaware, and New Jersey.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Petitioners pursued their clustering strategy by acquiring competitor cable providers in the region and swapping their own systems outside the region for competitor systems located in the region.

As a result of nine cluster- ing transactions, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 share of subscribers in the re- gion allegedly increased from 23.9 percent in 1998 to 69.5 percent in 2007.  See 264 F. R.

Second, Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s activities reduced the level of competition from \xe2\x80\x9coverbuilders,\xe2\x80\x9d companies that build competing cable networks in areas where an incumbent cable company already operates.  Third, Comcast reduced the level of \xe2\x80\x9cbenchmark\xe2\x80\x9d competition on which cable customers rely to compare prices.  Fourth, clustering increased Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s bargaining power relative to content providers.

To establish such dam- ages, respondents had relied solely on the testimony of Dr. James McClave.  Dr. McClave designed a regression model comparing actual cable prices in the Philadelphia DMA with hypothetical prices that would have prevailed but for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 allegedly anticompetitive activities.  The model calculated damages of $875,576,662 for the entire class.  App. 1388a (sealed).

On appeal, petitioners contended the class was improperly certified because the model, among other shortcomings, failed to attribute damages resulting from overbuilder deterrence, the only theory of injury remaining in the case.  The court refused to consider the argument because, in its view, such an \xe2\x80\x9cattac[k] on the merits of the methodology [had] no place in the class certification inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  655 F. 3d 182, 207 (CA3 2011).

If respondents prevail on their claims, they would be entitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition, since that is the only theory of antitrust impact accepted for class-action treatment by the District Court.  It follows that a model purporting to serve as evidence of damages in this class action must measure only those damages attributable to that theory.  If the model does not even attempt to do that, it cannot possibly establish that damages are susceptible of measurement across the entire class for purposes of Rule 23(b)(3).  Calculations need not be exact, see Story Parchment Co. v. Paterson Parchment Paper Co., \n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555, \n563 (1931)\n, but at the class-certification stage (as at trial), any model supporting a \xe2\x80\x9cplaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s damages case must be consistent with its liability case, particularly with respect to the alleged anticompetitive effect of the violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  ABA Section of Antitrust Law, Proving Antitrust Damages: Legal and Economic Issues 57, 62 (2d ed. 2010); see, e.g., Image Tech. Servs. v. Eastman Kodak Co., 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 1195, 1224 (CA9 1997).  And for purposes of Rule 23, courts must conduct a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rigorous analysis\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether that is so.

That, they said, would involve consideration of the \xe2\x80\x9cmerits\xe2\x80\x9d having \xe2\x80\x9cno place in the class certification inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 206\xe2\x80\x93207.  That reasoning flatly contradicts our cases requiring a determination that Rule 23 is satisfied, even when that requires inquiry into the merits of the claim.  Wal-Mart, supra, at ___, and n.\xc2\xa06 (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and n.\xc2\xa06).  The Court of Appeals simply concluded that respondents \xe2\x80\x9cprovided a method to measure and quantify damages on a classwide basis,\xe2\x80\x9d finding it unnecessary to decide \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the methodology [was] a just and reasonable inference or speculative.\xe2\x80\x9d  655 F. 3d, at 206.  Under that logic, at the class-certification stage any method of measurement is acceptable so long as it can be applied classwide, no matter how arbitrary the measurements may be.  Such a proposition would reduce Rule 23(b)(3)\xe2\x80\x99s predominance requirement to a nullity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no question that the model failed to measure damages resulting from the particular antitrust injury on which petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 liability in this action is premised.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The scheme devised by respondents\xe2\x80\x99 expert, Dr. McClave, sought to establish a \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d baseline\xe2\x80\x94a figure that would show what the competitive prices would have been if there had been no antitrust violations.  Damages would then be determined by comparing to that baseline what the actual prices were during the charged period.  The \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d figure was calculated, however, by assuming a market that contained none of the four distortions that respondents attributed to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 actions.  In other words, the model assumed the validity of all four theories of antitrust impact initially advanced by respondents: decreased penetration by satellite providers, overbuilder deterrence, lack of benchmark competition, and increased bargaining power.  At the evidentiary hearing, Dr. McClave expressly admitted that the model calculated damages resulting from \xe2\x80\x9cthe alleged anticompetitive conduct as a whole\xe2\x80\x9d and did not attribute damages to any one particular theory of anticompetitive impact.

In all respects unrelated to reduced overbuilding, the benchmark counties should reflect the actual conditions in the Philadelphia DMA, or else the model will identify \xe2\x80\x98damages\xe2\x80\x99 that are not the result of reduced overbuilding, or, in other words, that are not the certain result of the wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  655 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 216 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority\xe2\x80\x99s only response to this was that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]t the class certification stage we do not require that Plaintiffs tie each theory of antitrust impact to an exact calculation of damages, but instead that they assure us that if they can prove antitrust impact, the resulting damages are capable of measurement and will not require labyrinthine individual calculations.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 206.  But such assurance is not provided by a methodology that identifies damages that are not the result of the wrong.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling is good for this day and case only. In the mine run of cases, it remains the \xe2\x80\x9cblack letter rule\xe2\x80\x9d that a class may obtain certification under Rule 23(b)(3) when liability questions common to the class predominate over damages questions unique to class members.  2 Rubenstein, supra, \xc2\xa74:54, at 208.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIncautiously entering the fray at this interlocutory stage, the Court sets forth a profoundly mistaken view of antitrust law.

Plaintiffs below, re-spondents here, alleged that Comcast violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71 and 2 of the Sherman Act.  See 15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 2.  For present purposes, the \xc2\xa72 claim provides the better illustration.  A firm is guilty of monopolization under \xc2\xa72 if the plaintiff proves (1)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe possession of monopoly power in the relevant market\xe2\x80\x9d and (2)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cthe willful acquisition or maintenance of that power[,] as distinguished from growth or development as a consequence of a superior product, business acumen, or historic accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Grinnell Corp., \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 563\n\xe2\x80\x93571 (1966).  A private plaintiff seeking damages must also show that (3)\xc2\xa0the monopolization caused \xe2\x80\x9cinjur[y].\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715.  We have said that antitrust injuries must be \xe2\x80\x9cof the type the antitrust laws were intended to prevent and that flo[w] from that which makes defendants\xe2\x80\x99 acts unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Atlantic Richfield Co. v. USA Petroleum Co., \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 328, \n334 (1990)\n (quoting Brunswick Corp. v. Pueblo Bowl-O-Mat, Inc., \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, \n489 (1977)\n).  See 2A Areeda &amp; Ho-venkamp \xc2\xb6391a, at 320 (To prove antitrust injury, \xe2\x80\x9c[a] private plaintiff must identify the economic rationale for a business practice\xe2\x80\x99s illegality under the antitrust laws and show that its harm flows from whatever it is that makes the practice unlawful.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs plaintiffs below, respondents attempted to meet these requirements by showing that (1) Comcast obtained a 60% or greater share of the Philadelphia market, and that its share provides it with monopoly power; (2) Comcast acquired its share through exclusionary conduct consisting of a series of mergers with competitors and \xe2\x80\x9cswaps\xe2\x80\x9d of customers and locations; and (3)\xc2\xa0Comcast consequently injured respondents by charging them supra-competitive prices.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf, as respondents contend, Philadelphia is a separate well-defined market, and the alleged exclusionary conduct permitted Comcast to obtain a market share of at least 60%, then proving the \xc2\xa72 violation may not be arduous.  As a point of comparison, the government considers a market shared by four firms, each of which has 25% market share, to be \xe2\x80\x9chighly concentrated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Justice &amp; Federal Trade Commission, Horizontal Merger Guidelines \xc2\xa75.3, p. 19 (2010).  A market, such as the one alleged by respondents, where one firm controls 60% is far worse.  See id., \xc2\xa75.3, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319, and n.\xc2\xa09 (using a concentration index that determines a market\xe2\x80\x99s concentration level by summing the squares of each firm\xe2\x80\x99s market share, one firm with 100% yielding 10,000, five firms with 20% each yielding 2000, while a market where one firm accounts for 60% yields an index number of at least 3,600).  The Guidelines, and any standard antitrust treatise, explain why firms in highly concentrated markets normally have the power to raise prices significantly above competitive levels.  See, e.g., 2B Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb6503, at 115.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo far there is agreement.  But consider the last matter respondents must prove: Can they show that Comcast injured them by charging higher prices?  After all, a firm with monopoly power will not necessarily exercise that power by charging higher prices.  It could instead act less competitively in other ways, such as by leading the quiet life.  See J. Hicks, Annual Survey of Economic Theory: The Theory of Monopoly, 3 Econometrica 1, 8 (1935) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe best of all monopoly profits is a quiet life.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is at this point that Dr. McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model enters the scene.  His model first selects a group of comparable outside-Philadelphia \xe2\x80\x9cbenchmark\xe2\x80\x9d counties, where Comcast enjoyed a lower market share (and where satellite broadcasting accounted for more of the local business).  Using multiple regression analysis, McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model measures the effect of the anticompetitive conduct by comparing the class counties to the benchmark counties.  The model concludes that the prices Philadelphia area consumers would have paid had the Philadelphia counties shared the properties of the benchmark counties (including a diminished Comcast market share), would have been 13.1% lower than those they actually paid.  Thus, the model provides evidence that Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s anticompetitive conduct, which led to a 60% market share, caused the class to suffer injuriously higher prices.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe special antitrust-related difficulty present here stems from the manner in which respondents attempted to prove their antitrust injuries.  They proffered four \xe2\x80\x9cnon-exclusive mechanisms\xe2\x80\x9d that allegedly \xe2\x80\x9ccause[d] the high prices\xe2\x80\x9d in the Philadelphia area.  App. 403a.  Those four theories posit that (1) due to Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s acquisitions of competitors, customers found it more difficult to compare prices; (2)\xc2\xa0one set of potential competitors, namely Direct Broadcast Satellite companies, found it more difficult to obtain access to local sports broadcasts and consequently decided not to enter the Philadelphia market; (3) Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain programming material at lower prices permitted it to raise prices; and (4) a number of potential competitors (called \xe2\x80\x9coverbuilders\xe2\x80\x9d), whose presence in the market would have limited Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s power to raise prices, were ready to enter some parts of the market but decided not to do so in light of Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s anticompetitive conduct.  264 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D. 150, 161\xe2\x80\x93162 (ED Pa. 2010).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor reasons not here relevant, the District Court found the first three theories inapplicable and limited the liability-phase proof to the \xe2\x80\x9coverbuilder\xe2\x80\x9d theory.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 192a\xe2\x80\x93193a.  It then asked the parties to brief whether doing so had any impact on the viability of McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model as a measure of classwide damages.  See 264 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 190.  After considering the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments, the District Court found that striking the three theories \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not impeach Dr. McClave\xe2\x80\x99s damages model\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny anticompetitive conduct is reflected in the [higher Philadelphia] price [which Dr. McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model determines], not in the [the model\xe2\x80\x99s] selection of the comparison counties, [i.e., the lower-price \xe2\x80\x98benchmark counties\xe2\x80\x99 with which the Philadelphia area prices were compared].\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 190\xe2\x80\x93191.  The court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cwhether or not we accepted all [four] . . . theories . . . is inapposite to Dr. McClave\xe2\x80\x99s methods of choosing benchmarks.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

To reach this conclusion the Court must consider fact-based matters, namely what this econometric multiple-regression model is about, what it proves, and how it does so.  And it must overturn two lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 related factual findings to the contrary.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are normally \xe2\x80\x9creluctant to disturb findings of fact in which two courts below have concurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Doe, \n\n465 U. S. 605, \n614 (1984)\n.  See also United States v. Virginia, \n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515\n, n.\xc2\xa05 (1996) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cour well-settled rule that we will not \xe2\x80\x98undertake to review concurrent findings of fact by two courts below in the absence of a very obvious and exceptional showing of error\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Graver Tank &amp; Mfg. Co. v. Linde Air Products Co., \n\n336 U.\xc2\xa0S. 271, \n275 (1949)\n)).  Here, the District Court found McClave\xe2\x80\x99s econometric model capable of measuring damages on a classwide basis, even after striking three of the injury theories.  264 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 190\xe2\x80\x93191.  Contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, see ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa05, this was not a legal conclusion about what the model proved; it was a factual finding about how the model worked.  Under our typical practice, we should leave that finding alone.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, as far as we can tell, the lower courts were right.  On the basis of the record as we understand it, the District Court did not abuse its discretion in finding that McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model could measure damages suffered by the class\xe2\x80\x94even if the damages were limited to those caused by deterred overbuilding.  That is because respondents alleged that Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s anticompetitive conduct increased Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s market share (and market power) by deterring potential entrants, in particular, overbuilders, from entering the Philadelphia area market.  See App. 43a\xe2\x80\x9366a.  By showing that this was so, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proof tends to show the same in respect to other entrants.  The overbuilders\xe2\x80\x99 failure to enter deprives the market of the price discipline that their entry would have provided in other parts via threat of the overbuilders\xe2\x80\x99 expansion or that of others potentially led on by their example.  Indeed, in the District Court, Comcast argued that the three other theories, i.e., the three rejected theories, had no impact on prices.  See 264 F.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0D., at 166, 176, 180\xe2\x80\x93181.  If Comcast was right, then the damages McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model found must have stemmed exclusively from conduct that deterred new entry, say from \xe2\x80\x9coverbuilders.\xe2\x80\x9d  Not surprisingly, the Court offers no support at all for its contrary conclusion, namely, that the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obvious[ly] and exceptional[ly]\xe2\x80\x99 erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa05 (quoting Virginia, 518 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 589, n.\xc2\xa05 (Scalia, J., dissenting)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe are particularly concerned about the matter because the Court, in reaching its contrary conclusion, makes broad statements about antitrust law that it could not mean to apply in other cases.  The Court begins with what it calls an \xe2\x80\x9cunremarkable premise\xe2\x80\x9d that respondents could be \xe2\x80\x9centitled only to damages resulting from reduced overbuilder competition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at\xc2\xa07.  In most \xc2\xa72 cases, how-ever, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s starting place would seem remarkable, not \xe2\x80\x9cunremarkable.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSuppose in a different case a plaintiff were to prove that Widget, Inc. has obtained, through anticompetitive means, a 90% share of the California widget market.  Suppose the plaintiff also proves that the two small remaining firms\xe2\x80\x94one in Ukiah, the other in San Diego\xe2\x80\x94lack the capacity to expand their widget output to the point where that pos-sibility could deter Widget, Inc. from raising its prices.  Suppose further that the plaintiff introduces a model that shows California widget prices are now twice those in every other State, which, the model concludes is (after accounting for other possible reasons) the result of lack of competition in the California widget market.  Why would a court hearing that case restrict damages solely to customers in the vicinity of Ukiah and San Diego?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike the model in this example, Dr. McClave\xe2\x80\x99s model does not purport to show precisely how Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s conduct led to higher prices in the Philadelphia area.  It simply shows that Comcast\xe2\x80\x99s conduct brought about higher prices.  And it measures the amount of subsequent harm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause the parties did not fully argue the question the Court now answers, all Members of the Court may lack a complete understanding of the model or the meaning of related statements in the record.  The need for focused argument is particularly strong here where, as we have said, the underlying considerations are detailed, technical, and fact-based.  The Court departs from our ordinary practice, risks inaccurate judicial decisionmaking, and is unfair to respondents and the courts below.
