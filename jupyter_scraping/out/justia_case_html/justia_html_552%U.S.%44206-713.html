Respondent political parties claim that the new law, on its face, violates a party\xe2\x80\x99s associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse.

S. 581</a>, 586.  Contrary to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s presumption in <em>Jones\xe2\x80\x94</em>that a nonpartisan blanket primary where the top two votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of party would be a less restrictive alternative to California\xe2\x80\x99s system because it would not nominate candidates\xe2\x80\x94is not dispositive here.  There, the Court had no occasion to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments that I\xe2\x80\x93872 imposes a severe burden are flawed.  They claim that the law is unconstitutional under <em>Jones</em> because it allows primary voters unaffiliated with a party to choose the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee, thus violating the party\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose its own standard bearer.  Unlike California\xe2\x80\x99s primary, however, the I\xe2\x80\x93872 primary does not, by its terms, choose the parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees.  The choice of a party representative does not occur under I\xe2\x80\x93872.  The two top primary candidates proceed to the general election regardless of their party preferences.  Whether the parties nominate their own candidate outside the state-run primary is irrelevant.  Respondents counter that voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are their preferred nominees; and that even if voters do not make that assumption, they will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, the nominees.  However, those claims depend not on any facial requirement of I\xe2\x80\x93872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning of the party-preference designation.  This is sheer speculation.  Even if voters could possibly misinterpret the designations, I\xe2\x80\x93872 cannot be struck down in a facial challenge based on the mere possibility of voter confusion.  The State could implement I\xe2\x80\x93872 in a variety of ways, <em>e.g., </em>through ballot design, that would eliminate any real threat of confusion.  And without the specter of widespread voter confusion, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 forced association and compelled speech arguments fall flat.

Its interest in providing voters with relevant information about the candidates on the ballot is easily sufficient to sustain the provision.

The People\xe2\x80\x99s Choice Initiative of 2004, or Initiative 872 (I\xe2\x80\x93872), provides that candidates for office shall be identified on the ballot by their self-designated \xe2\x80\x9cparty preference\xe2\x80\x9d; that voters may vote for any candidate; and that the top two votegetters for each office, regardless of party preference, advance to the general election.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held I\xe2\x80\x93872 facially invalid as imposing an unconstitutional burden on state political parties\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights.  Because I\xe2\x80\x93872 does not on its face impose a severe burden on political parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights, and because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments to the contrary rest on factual assumptions about voter confusion that can be evaluated only in the context of an as-applied challenge, we reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For most of the past century, Washington voters selected nominees for state and local offices using a blanket primary.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  From 1935 until 2003, the State used a blanket primary that placed candidates from all parties on one ballot and allowed voters to select a candidate from any party.  See 1935 Wash. Laws, ch. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x935, pp. 60\xe2\x80\x9364.  Under this system, the candidate who won a plurality of votes within each major party became that party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee in the general election.  See 2003 Wash. Laws, \xc2\xa7919, p. 775.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California used a nearly identical primary in its own elections until our decision in <em>California Democratic Party </em>v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a> (2000).  In <em>Jones</em>, four political parties challenged California\xe2\x80\x99s blanket primary, arguing that it unconstitutionally burdened their associational rights by forcing them to associate with voters who did not share their beliefs.  We agreed and struck down the blanket primary as inconsistent with the First Amendment.  In so doing, we emphasized the importance of the nomination process as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the crucial juncture at which the appeal to common principles may be translated into concerted action, and hence to political power in the community.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 575 (quoting <em>Tashjian</em> v. <em>Republican Party of Conn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/index.html">479 U. S. 208</a>, 216 (1986)).  We observed that a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to exclude is central to its freedom of association, and is never \xe2\x80\x9cmore important than in the process of selecting its nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U. S., at 575.  California\xe2\x80\x99s blanket primary, we concluded, severely burdened the parties\xe2\x80\x99 freedom of association because it forced them to allow nonmembers to participate in selecting the parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees.  That the parties retained the right to endorse their preferred candidates did not render the burden any less severe, as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is simply no substitute for a party\xe2\x80\x99s selecting its own candidates.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 581.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because California\xe2\x80\x99s blanket primary severely burdened the parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights, we subjected it to strict scrutiny, carefully examining each of the state interests offered by California in support of its primary system.  We rejected as illegitimate three of the asserted interests: \xe2\x80\x9cproducing elected officials who better represent the electorate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cexpanding candidate debate beyond the scope of partisan concerns,\xe2\x80\x9d and ensuring \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to an effective vote\xe2\x80\x9d by allowing nonmembers of a party to vote in the majority party\xe2\x80\x99s primary in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98safe\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d districts.  <em>Id.,</em> at 582\xe2\x80\x93584.  We concluded that the remaining interests\xe2\x80\x94promoting fairness, affording voters greater choice, increasing voter participation, and protecting privacy\xe2\x80\x94were not compelling on the facts of the case.  Even if they were, the partisan California primary was not narrowly tailored to further those interests because a nonpartisan blanket primary, in which the top two votegetters advance to the general election regardless of party affiliation, would accomplish each of those interests without burdening the parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights.  <em>Id.,</em> at 585\xe2\x80\x93586.  The nonpartisan blanket primary had \xe2\x80\x9call the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters [were] not choosing a party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After our decision in <em>Jones</em>, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit struck down Washington\xe2\x80\x99s primary as \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially indistinguishable from the California scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Democratic Party of Washington State </em>v. <em>Reed</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 1198, 1203 (2003).  The Washington State Grange[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] promptly proposed I\xe2\x80\x93872 as a replacement.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  It passed with nearly 60% of the vote and became effective in December 2004.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under I\xe2\x80\x93872, all elections for \xe2\x80\x9cpartisan offices\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] are conducted in two stages: a primary and a general election.  To participate in the primary, a candidate must file a \xe2\x80\x9cdeclaration of candidacy\xe2\x80\x9d form, on which he declares his \xe2\x80\x9cmajor or minor party preference, or independent status.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa729A.24.030 (Supp. 2005).  Each candidate and his party preference (or independent status) is in turn designated on the primary election ballot.  A political party cannot prevent a candidate who is unaffiliated with, or even repugnant to, the party from designating it as his party of preference.  See Wash. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7434\xe2\x80\x93215\xe2\x80\x93015 (2005).  In the primary election, voters may select \xe2\x80\x9cany candidate listed on the ballot, regardless of the party preference of the candidates or the voter.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7434\xe2\x80\x93262\xe2\x80\x93012.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The candidates with the highest and second-highest vote totals advance to the general election, regardless of their party preferences.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus, the general election may pit two candidates with the same party preference against one another.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party preference is listed on the general election ballot, and may not be changed between the primary and general elections.  See \xc2\xa7434\xe2\x80\x93230\xe2\x80\x93040.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Immediately after the State enacted regulations to implement I\xe2\x80\x93872, the Washington State Republican Party filed suit against a number of county auditors challenging the law on its face.  The party contended that the new system violates its associational rights by usurping its right to nominate its own candidates and by forcing it to associate with candidates it does not endorse.  The Washington State Democratic Central Committee and Libertarian Party of Washington State joined the suit as plaintiffs.  The Washington State Grange joined as a defendant, and the State of Washington was substituted for the county auditors as defendant.  The United States District Court for the Western District of Washington granted the political parties\xe2\x80\x99 motions for summary judgment and enjoined the implementation of I\xe2\x80\x93872.  See <em>Washington State Republican Party </em>v. <em>Logan</em>, 377 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 907, 932 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals affirmed.  460 F.\xc2\xa03d 1108, 1125 (CA9 2006).  It held that the I\xe2\x80\x93872 primary severely burdens the political parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights because the party-preference designation on the ballot creates a risk that primary winners will be perceived as the parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees and produces an \xe2\x80\x9cimpression of associatio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d between a candidate and his party of preference even when the party does not associate, or wish to be associated, with the candidate.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1119.  The Court of Appeals noted a \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally significant distinction between ballots and other vehicles for political expression,\xe2\x80\x9d reasoning that the risk of perceived association is particularly acute when ballots include party labels because such labels are typically used to designate candidates\xe2\x80\x99 views on issues of public concern.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1121.  And it determined that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interests underlying I\xe2\x80\x93872 were not sufficiently compelling to justify the severe burden on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 association.  Concluding that the provisions of I\xe2\x80\x93872 providing for the party-preference designation on the ballot were not severable, the court struck down I\xe2\x80\x93872 in its entirety.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), to determine whether I\xe2\x80\x93872, on its face, violates the political parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents object to I\xe2\x80\x93872 not in the context of an actual election, but in a facial challenge.  Under <em>United States</em> v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a> (1987), a plaintiff can only succeed in a facial challenge by \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ing] that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, that the law is unconstitutional in all of its applications.  <em>Id.,</em> at 745.  While some Members of the Court have criticized the <em>Salerno</em> formulation, all agree that a facial challenge must fail where the statute has a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 739\xe2\x80\x93740, and n.\xc2\xa07 (1997) (Stevens, J., concurring in judgments).  Washington\xe2\x80\x99s primary system survives under either standard, as we explain below.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  In determining whether a law is facially invalid, we must be careful not to go beyond the statute\xe2\x80\x99s facial requirements and speculate about \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cimaginary\xe2\x80\x9d cases.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 22 (1960) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe delicate power of pronouncing an Act of Congress unconstitutional is not to be exercised with reference to hypothetical cases thus imagined\xe2\x80\x9d).  The State has had no opportunity to implement I\xe2\x80\x93872, and its courts have had no occasion to construe the law in the context of actual disputes arising from the electoral context, or to accord the law a limiting construction to avoid constitutional questions.  Cf. <em>Yazoo &amp; Mississippi Valley R. Co.</em> v. <em>Jackson Vinegar Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/226/217/index.html">226 U. S. 217</a>, 220 (1912) (\xe2\x80\x9cHow the state court may apply [a statute] to other cases, whether its general words may be treated as more or less restrained, and how far parts of it may be sustained if others fail are matters upon which we need not speculate now\xe2\x80\x9d).  Exercising judicial restraint in a facial challenge \xe2\x80\x9cfrees the Court not only from unnecessary pronouncement on constitutional issues, but also from premature interpretations of statutes in areas where their constitutional application might be cloudy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Raines</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 22.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Facial challenges are disfavored for several reasons.  Claims of facial invalidity often rest on speculation.  As a consequence, they raise the risk of \xe2\x80\x9cpremature interpretation of statutes on the basis of factually barebones records.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sabri</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/600/index.html">541 U. S. 600</a>, 609 (2004) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Facial challenges also run contrary to the fundamental principle of judicial restraint that courts should neither \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98anticipate a question of constitutional law in advance of the necessity of deciding it\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98formulate a rule of constitutional law broader than is required by the precise facts to which it is to be applied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U.

Co.</em> v. <em>Commissioners of Emigration</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/113/33/index.html">113 U. S. 33</a>, 39 (1885)).  Finally, facial challenges threaten to short circuit the democratic process by preventing laws embodying the will of the people from being implemented in a manner consistent with the Constitution.

That disagreement begins with <em>Jones</em>.  Petitioners argue that the I\xe2\x80\x93872 primary is indistinguishable from the alternative <em>Jones</em> suggested would be constitutional.  In <em>Jones</em> we noted that a nonpartisan blanket primary, where the top two votegetters proceed to the general election regardless of their party, was a less restrictive alternative to California\xe2\x80\x99s system because such a primary does not nominate candidates. 530 U. S., at 585\xe2\x80\x93586 (The nonpartisan blanket primary \xe2\x80\x9chas all the characteristics of the partisan blanket primary, save the constitutionally crucial one: Primary voters are not choosing a party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioners are correct that we assumed that the nonpartisan primary we described in <em>Jones</em> would be constitutional.  But that is not dispositive here because we had no occasion in <em>Jones</em> to determine whether a primary system that indicates each candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party preference on the ballot, in effect, chooses the parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That question is now squarely before us.  Respondents argue that I\xe2\x80\x93872 is unconstitutional under <em>Jones</em> because it has the same \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutionally crucial\xe2\x80\x9d infirmity that doomed California\xe2\x80\x99s blanket primary: it allows primary voters who are unaffiliated with a party to choose the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.  Respondents claim that candidates who progress to the general election under I\xe2\x80\x93872 will become the <em>de facto</em> nominees of the parties they prefer, thereby violating the parties\xe2\x80\x99 right to choose their own standard-bearers, see <em>Timmons</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 359, and altering their messages.  They rely on our statement in <em>Jones</em> reaffirming \xe2\x80\x9cthe special place the First Amendment reserves for, and the special protection it accords, the process by which a political party \xe2\x80\x98select[s] a standard bearer who best represents the party\xe2\x80\x99s ideologies and preferences.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jones</em>, 550 U. S., at 575 (quoting <em>Eu</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 224).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The flaw in this argument is that, unlike the California primary, the I\xe2\x80\x93872 primary does not, by its terms, choose parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees.  The essence of nomination\xe2\x80\x94the choice of a party representative\xe2\x80\x94does not occur under I\xe2\x80\x93872.  The law never refers to the candidates as nominees of any party, nor does it treat them as such.  To the contrary, the election regulations specifically provide that the primary \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not serve to determine the nominees of a political party but serves to winnow the number of candidates to a final list of two for the general election.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wash. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7434\xe2\x80\x93262\xe2\x80\x93012.  The top two candidates from the primary election proceed to the general election regardless of their party preferences.  Whether parties nominate their own candidates outside the state-run primary is simply irrelevant.  In fact, parties may now nominate candidates by whatever mechanism they choose because I\xe2\x80\x93872 repealed Washington\xe2\x80\x99s prior regulations governing party nominations.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents counter that, even if the I\xe2\x80\x93872 primary does not actually choose parties\xe2\x80\x99 nominees, it nevertheless burdens their associational rights because voters will assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their preferred parties.  This brings us to the heart of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case\xe2\x80\x94and to the fatal flaw in their argument.  At bottom, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 objection to I\xe2\x80\x93872 is that voters will be confused by candidates\xe2\x80\x99 party-preference designations.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments are largely variations on this theme.  Thus, they argue that even if voters do not assume that candidates on the general election ballot are the nominees of their parties, they will at least assume that the parties associate with, and approve of, them.  This, they say, compels them to associate with candidates they do not endorse, alters the messages they wish to convey,<font super="1"> and forces them to engage in counterspeech to disassociate themselves from the candidates and their positions on the issues.</font></p><font super="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject each of these contentions for the same reason: They all depend, not on any facial requirement of I\xe2\x80\x93872, but on the possibility that voters will be confused as to the meaning of the party-preference designation.  But respondents\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that voters will misinterpret the party-preference designation is sheer speculation.  It \xe2\x80\x9cdepends upon the belief that voters can be \xe2\x80\x98misled\xe2\x80\x99 by party labels.  But \xe2\x80\x98[o]ur cases reflect a greater faith in the ability of individual voters to inform themselves about campaign issues.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Tashjian</em>, 479 U. S., at 220 (quoting <em>Anderson</em>, 460 U. S., at 797).  There is simply no basis to presume that a well-informed electorate will interpret a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s party-preference designation to mean that the candidate is the party\xe2\x80\x99s chosen nominee or representative or that the party associates with or approves of the candidate.

This strikes us as especially true here, given that it was the voters of Washington themselves, rather than their elected representatives, who enacted I\xe2\x80\x93872.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, it is <em>possible</em> that voters will misinterpret the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 party-preference designations as reflecting endorsement by the parties.  But these cases involve a facial challenge, and we cannot strike down I\xe2\x80\x93872 on its face based on the mere possibility of voter confusion.  See <em>Yazoo</em>,<em> </em>226 U.

Indeed, because I\xe2\x80\x93872 has never been implemented, we do not even have ballots indicating how party preference will be displayed.  It stands to reason that whether voters will be confused by the party-preference designations will depend in significant part on the form of the ballot.

It thought that even such a clear statement did too little to eliminate the risk of voter confusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But we see no reason to stop there.  As long as we are speculating about the form of the ballot\xe2\x80\x94and we can do no more than speculate in this facial challenge\xe2\x80\x94we must, in fairness to the voters of the State of Washington who enacted I\xe2\x80\x93872 and in deference to the executive and judicial officials who are charged with implementing it, ask whether the ballot could conceivably be printed in such a way as to eliminate the possibility of widespread voter confusion and with it the perceived threat to the First Amendment.  See <em>Ayotte</em>, 546 U. S., at 329 (noting that courts should not nullify more of a state law than necessary so as to avoid frustrating the intent of the people and their duly elected representatives); <em>Ward</em> v. <em>Rock Against Racism</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/491/781/index.html">491 U.

For example, petitioners propose that the actual I\xe2\x80\x93872 ballot could include prominent disclaimers explaining that party preference reflects only the self-designation of the candidate and not an official endorsement by the party.  They also suggest that the ballots might note preference in the form of a candidate statement that emphasizes the candidate\xe2\x80\x99s personal determination rather than the party\xe2\x80\x99s acceptance of the candidate, such as \xe2\x80\x9cmy party preference is the Republican Party.\xe2\x80\x9d  Additionally, the State could decide to educate the public about the new primary ballots through advertising or explanatory materials mailed to voters along with their ballots.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  We are satisfied that there are a variety of ways in which the State could implement I\xe2\x80\x93872 that would eliminate any real threat of voter confusion.  And without the specter of widespread voter confusion, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments about forced association[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] and compelled speech[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] fall flat.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our conclusion that these implementations of I\xe2\x80\x93872 would be consistent with the First Amendment is fatal to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 facial challenge.

See <em>Anderson</em>, 460 U.

Immediately after implementing regulations were enacted, respondents obtained a permanent injunction against the enforcement of I\xe2\x80\x93872.  The First Amendment does not require this extraordinary and precipitous nullification of the will of the people.  Because I\xe2\x80\x93872 does not on its face provide for the nomination of candidates or compel political parties to associate with or endorse candidates, and because there is no basis in this facial challenge for presuming that candidates\xe2\x80\x99 party-preference designations will confuse voters, I\xe2\x80\x93872 does not on its face severely burden respondents\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights.

Our other forced-association cases indicate as much.  In <em>Boy Scouts of America</em> v. <em>Dale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/640/index.html">530 U. S. 640</a>, 653 (2000), we said that Dale\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the Boy Scouts would \xe2\x80\x9cforce the organization to send a message . . . [to] the world\xe2\x80\x9d that the Scouts approved of homosexuality.  In other words, accepting Dale would lead outsiders to believe the Scouts endorsed homosexual conduct.  Largely for that reason, we held that the First Amendment entitled the Scouts to exclude Dale.  <em>Id</em>., at 659.  Similarly, in <em>Hurley</em> v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/557/index.html">515 U. S. 557</a> (1995), we allowed the organizers of Boston\xe2\x80\x99s St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day Parade to exclude a pro-gay rights float because the float\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the parade might create the impression that the organizers agreed with the float-sponsors\xe2\x80\x99 message.  See <em>id.</em>, at 575\xe2\x80\x93577.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voter perceptions matter, and if voters do not actually believe the parties and the candidates are tied together, it is hard to see how the parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights are adversely implicated.  See <em>Rumsfeld</em> v. <em>Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/47/index.html">547 U.

After all, individuals frequently claim to favor this or that political party; these preferences, without more, do not create an unconstitutional forced association.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What makes these cases different, as Justice Scalia explains, is the place where the candidates express their party preferences: on the ballot.  See <em>post</em>, at 4 (dissenting opinion) (noting \xe2\x80\x9cthe special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections\xe2\x80\x9d).  And what makes the ballot \xe2\x80\x9cspecial\xe2\x80\x9d is precisely the effect it has on voter impressions.  See <em>Cook</em> v. <em>Gralike</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/510/index.html">531 U. S. 510</a>, 532 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he ballot . .\xc2\xa0. is the last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Martin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/399/index.html">375 U.

Petitioners themselves emphasize that the content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined.  See Reply Brief for Washington State Grange 2\xe2\x80\x934, 7\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the ballot is designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to \xe2\x80\x9cprefer,\xe2\x80\x9d the\nI\xe2\x80\x93872 primary system would likely pass constitutional muster.  I cannot say on the present record that it would be impossible for the State to design such a ballot.  Assuming the ballot is so designed, voters would not regard the listed candidates as \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d candidates, any more than someone saying \xe2\x80\x9cI like Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s soup\xe2\x80\x9d would be understood to be associated with Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s.  Voters would understand that the candidate does not speak on the party\xe2\x80\x99s behalf or with the party\xe2\x80\x99s approval.  On the other hand, if the ballot merely lists the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 preferred parties next to the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 names, or otherwise fails clearly to convey that the parties and the candidates are not necessarily associated, the I\xe2\x80\x93872 system would not survive a First Amendment challenge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia complains that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is hard to know how to respond\xe2\x80\x9d to such mistaken views, <em>post</em>, at 6 (dissenting opinion), but he soldiers on nonetheless.  He would hold that a party is burdened by a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s statement of preference even if no reasonable voter believes from the ballot that the party and the candidate are associated.  I take his point to be that a particular candidate\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cendorsement\xe2\x80\x9d of a party might alter the party\xe2\x80\x99s message, and this violates the party\xe2\x80\x99s freedom of association.  See <em>post</em>, at 7 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there is no general right to stop an individual from saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer this party,\xe2\x80\x9d even if the party would rather he not.  Normally, the party protects its message in such a case through responsive speech of its own.  What makes this case different of course is that the State controls the content of the ballot, which we have never considered a public forum.  See <em>Timmons</em> v. <em>Twin Cities Area New Party</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/351/index.html">520 U. S. 351</a>, 363 (1997) (ballots are not \xe2\x80\x9cforums for political expression\xe2\x80\x9d).  Neither the candidate nor the party dictates the message conveyed by the ballot.  In such a case, it is important to know what the ballot actually says\xe2\x80\x94both about the candidate and about the party\xe2\x80\x99s association with the candidate.  It is possible that no reasonable voter in Washington State will regard the listed candidates as members of, or otherwise associated with, the political parties the candidates claim to prefer.  Nothing in my analysis requires the parties to produce studies regarding voter perceptions on this score, but I would wait to see what the ballot says before deciding whether it is unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Still, I agree with Justice Scalia that the history of the challenged law suggests the State is not particularly interested in devising ballots that meet these constitutional requirements.  See <em>post</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (dissenting opinion).  But this record simply does not allow us to say with certainty that the election system created by I\xe2\x80\x93872 is unconstitutional.  Accordingly, I agree with the Court that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 present challenge to the law must fail, and I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962564">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nWASHINGTON STATE GRANGE V.

When the state-printed ballot for the general election causes a party to be associated with candidates who may not fully (if at all) represent its views, it undermines both these vital aspects of political association.  The views of the self-identified party supporter color perception of the party\xe2\x80\x99s message, and that self-identification on the ballot, with no space for party repudiation or party identification of its own candidate, impairs the party\xe2\x80\x99s advocacy of its standard bearer.  Because Washington has not demonstrated that this severe burden upon parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling interest\xe2\x80\x94indeed, because it seems to me Washington\xe2\x80\x99s only plausible interest is precisely to reduce the effectiveness of political parties\xe2\x80\x94I would find the law unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I begin with the principles on which the Court and I agree.  States may not use election regulations to undercut political parties\xe2\x80\x99 freedoms of speech or association.  See <em>U. S. Term Limits, Inc. </em>v. <em>Thornton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/779/index.html">514 U. S. 779</a>, 833\xe2\x80\x93834 (1995).  Thus, when a State regulates political parties as a part of its election process, we consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98character and magnitude\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the burden imposed on the party\xe2\x80\x99s associational rights and \xe2\x80\x9cthe extent to which the State\xe2\x80\x99s concerns make the burden necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Timmons</em> v. <em>Twin Cities Area New Party, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/520/351/index.html">520 U.

We therefore held, for example, that a State severely burdened the right of expressive association when it required the Boy Scouts to accept an openly gay scoutmaster.  The scoutmaster\xe2\x80\x99s presence \xe2\x80\x9cwould, at the very least, force the organization to send a message, both to the youth members and the world, that the Boy Scouts accepts homosexual conduct as a legitimate form of behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boy Scouts of America</em> v. <em>Dale</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/640/index.html">530 U. S. 640</a>, 653 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A political party\xe2\x80\x99s expressive mission is not simply, or even primarily, to persuade voters of the party\xe2\x80\x99s views.  Parties seek principally to promote the election of candidates who will implement those views.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Tashjian </em>v. <em>Republican Party of Conn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/208/index.html">479 U. S. 208</a>, 216 (1986); <em>Storer </em>v. <em>Brown</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/724/index.html">415 U. S. 724</a>, 745 (1974);<em> </em>M. Hershey &amp; P. Beck, Party Politics in America<em> </em>13<em> </em>(10th ed. 2003).  That is achieved in large part by marking candidates with the party\xe2\x80\x99s seal of approval.  Parties devote substantial resources to making their names trusted symbols of certain approaches to governance.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 239 (Declaration of Democratic Committee Chair Paul J. Berendt); J. Aldrich, Why Parties? 48\xe2\x80\x9349 (1995).  They then encourage voters to cast their votes for the candidates that carry the party name.  Parties\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to support candidates by marking them with the party trademark, so to speak, have been successful enough to make the party name, in the words of one commentator, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most important resource that the party possesses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cain, Party Autonomy and Two-Party Electoral Competition, 149 U.\xc2\xa0Pa. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 793, 804 (2001).  And all evidence suggests party labels are indeed a central consideration for most voters.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id.</em>, at 804, n. 34; Rahn, The Role of Partisan Stereotypes in Information Processing About Political Candidates,<em> </em>37 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 472 (1993); Klein &amp; Baum, Ballot Information and Voting Decisions in Judicial Elections, 54 Pol. Research Q. 709 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State of Washington need not like, and need not favor, political parties.  It is entirely free to decline running primaries for the selection of party nominees and to hold nonpartisan general elections in which party labels have no place on the ballot.  See <em>California Democratic Party </em>v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>, 585\xe2\x80\x93586 (2000).  Parties would then be left to their own devices in both selecting and publicizing their candidates.  But Washington has done more than merely decline to make its electoral machinery available for party building.  Recognizing that parties draw support for their candidates by giving them the party imprimatur, Washington seeks to reduce the effectiveness of that endorsement by allowing <em>any</em> candidate to use the ballot for drawing upon the goodwill that a party has developed, while preventing the party from using the ballot to reject the claimed association or to identify the genuine candidate of its choice.  This does not merely place the ballot off limits for party building; it makes the ballot an instrument by which party building is impeded, permitting unrebutted associations that the party itself does not approve.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These cases cannot be decided without taking account of the special role that a state-printed ballot plays in elections.  The ballot comes into play \xe2\x80\x9cat the most crucial stage in the electoral process\xe2\x80\x94the instant before the vote is cast.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson </em>v. <em>Martin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/375/399/index.html">375 U. S. 399</a>, 402 (1964).  It is the only document that all voters are guaranteed to\nsee, and it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe last thing the voter sees before he makes his choice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cook </em>v. <em>Gralike, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/510/index.html">531 U. S. 510</a>, 532 (2001) (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).  Thus, we have held that a State cannot elevate a particular issue to prominence by making it the only issue for which the ballot sets forth the candidates\xe2\x80\x99 positions.  <em>Id.,</em> at 525\xe2\x80\x93526 (opinion of the Court).  And we held unconstitutional California\xe2\x80\x99s election system, which listed as the party\xe2\x80\x99s candidate on the general election ballot the candidate selected in a state-run \xe2\x80\x9cblanket primary\xe2\x80\x9d in which all citizens could determine who would be the party\xe2\x80\x99s nominee.  <em>Jones, </em>530 U. S., at 586.  It was not enough to sustain the law that the party remained free to select its preferred candidate through another process, and could denounce or campaign against the candidate carrying the party\xe2\x80\x99s name on the general election ballot.  Forced association with the party on the general election ballot was fatal.  <em>Id., </em>at 575\xe2\x80\x93577.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes much of the fact that the party names shown on the Washington ballot may be billed as mere statements of candidate \xe2\x80\x9cpreference.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante,<font b="1"> </font></em><font b="1">at 11\xe2\x80\x9314.  To be sure, the party is not <em>itself </em>forced to display favor for someone it does not wish to associate with, as the Boy Scouts were arguably forced to do by employing the homosexual scoutmaster in <em>Dale</em>, and as the political parties were arguably forced to do by lending their ballot-endorsement as party nominee in <em>Jones.  </em>But thrusting an unwelcome, self-proclaimed association upon the party on the election ballot itself is amply destructive of the party\xe2\x80\x99s associational rights.  An individual\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of a party shapes the voter\xe2\x80\x99s view of what the party stands for, no less than the party\xe2\x80\x99s endorsement of an individual shapes the voter\xe2\x80\x99s view of what the individual stands for.  That is why party nominees are often asked (and regularly agree) to repudiate the support of persons regarded as racial extremists.  On Washington\xe2\x80\x99s ballot, such repudiation is impossible.  And because the ballot is the only document voters are guaranteed to see, and the last thing they see before casting their vote, there is \xe2\x80\x9cno means\nof replying\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwould be equally effective with the voter.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cook, supra,</em> at 532 (Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in judgment).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only is the party\xe2\x80\x99s message distorted, but its goodwill is hijacked.  There can be no dispute that candidate acquisition of party labels on Washington\xe2\x80\x99s ballot\xe2\x80\x94even if billed as self-identification\xe2\x80\x94is a means of garnering the support of those who trust and agree with the party.  The \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer the D\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer the R\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d will not be on the ballot for esthetic reasons; they are designed to link candidates to unwilling parties (or at least parties who are unable to express their revulsion) and to encourage voters to cast their ballots based in part on the trust they place in the party\xe2\x80\x99s name and the party\xe2\x80\x99s philosophy.  These harms will be present no matter how Washington\xe2\x80\x99s law is implemented.  There is therefore \xe2\x80\x9cno set of circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d under which Washington\xe2\x80\x99s law would not severely burden political parties, see <em>United States </em>v. <em>Salerno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/481/739/index.html">481 U. S. 739</a>, 745 (1987), and no good reason to wait until Washington has undermined its political parties to declare that it is forbidden to do so.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice would wait to see if the law is implemented in a manner that no more harms political parties than allowing a person to state that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98like[s] Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s soup\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would harm the Campbell Soup Company.  See <em>ante</em>, at 3 (concurring opinion).  It is hard to know how to respond.  First and most fundamentally, there is simply no comparison between statements of \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for an expressive association and statements of \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for soup.  The robust First Amendment freedom to associate belongs only to groups \xe2\x80\x9cengage[d] in \xe2\x80\x98expressive association,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dale</em>, 530 U. S., at 648.  The Campbell Soup Company does not exist to promote \na message, and \xe2\x80\x9cthere is only minimal constitutional protection of the freedom of <em>commercial</em> association,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Roberts </em>v. <em>United States</em> <em>Jaycees</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/609/index.html">468 U. S. 609</a>, 634 (1984) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in \njudgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, I assuredly do not share The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s view that the First Amendment will be satisfied so long as the ballot \xe2\x80\x9cis designed in such a manner that no reasonable voter would believe that the candidates listed there are nominees or members of, or otherwise associated with, the parties the candidates claimed to \xe2\x80\x98prefer.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  To begin with, it seems to me quite impossible for the ballot to satisfy a reasonable voter that the candidate is not \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with\xe2\x80\x9d the party for which he has expressed a preference.  He has associated <em>himself</em> with the party by his very expression of a preference\xe2\x80\x94and that indeed is the whole purpose of allowing the preference to be expressed.  If all The Chief Justice means by \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with\xe2\x80\x9d is that the candidate \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not speak on the party\xe2\x80\x99s behalf or with the party\xe2\x80\x99s approval,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, none of my analysis in this opinion relies upon that misperception, nor upon the misperception that the candidate is a member or the nominee of the party.  Avoiding those misperceptions is far from enough.  Is it enough to say on the ballot that a notorious and despised racist who says that the party is his choice does not speak with the party\xe2\x80\x99s approval?  Surely not.  His unrebutted association of that party with his views distorts the image of the party nonetheless.  And the fact that the candidate who expresses a \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for one or another party is shown not to be the nominee of that party does not deprive him of the boost from the party\xe2\x80\x99s reputation which the party wishes to confer only on its nominee.  The Chief Justice claims that \xe2\x80\x9cthe content of the ballots in the pertinent respect is yet to be determined,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>  I disagree.  We know all we need to know about the form of ballot.  When pressed, Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Attorney General assured us at oral argument that the ballot will <em>not </em>say whether the party for whom the candidate expresses a preference claims or disavows him.  (Of course it will not, for that would enable the party expression that it is the very object of this legislation to impair.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And finally, while The Chief Justice earlier expresses his awareness that the special character of the ballot is what makes these cases different, <em>ante</em>, at 2, his Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s Soup example seems to forget that.  If we must speak in terms of soup, Washington\xe2\x80\x99s law is like a law that encourages Oscar the Grouch (Sesame Street\xe2\x80\x99s famed bad-taste resident of a garbage can) to state a \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d for Campbell\xe2\x80\x99s at every point of sale, while barring the soup company from disavowing his endorsement, or indeed using its name at all, in those same crucial locations.  Reserving the most critical communications forum for statements of \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d by a potentially distasteful speaker alters public perceptions of the entity that is \xe2\x80\x9cpreferred\xe2\x80\x9d; and when this privileged connection undermines not a company\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify and promote soup but an expressive association\xe2\x80\x99s ability to identify \nand promote its message and its standard bearer, the State treads on the constitutionally protected freedom of association.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority opinion and The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence also endorse a wait-and-see approach on the grounds that it is not yet evident how the law will affect voter perception of the political parties.  But contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, it is not incumbent on the political parties to adduce \xe2\x80\x9cevidence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 15, that forced association affects their ability to advocate for their candidates and their causes.  We have never put expressive groups to this perhaps-impossible task.  Rather, we accept their own assessments of the matter.  The very cases on which The Chief Justice relies for a wait-and-see approach, <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932, establish as much.  In <em>Dale</em>, for example, we did not require the Boy Scouts to prove that forced acceptance of the openly homosexual scoutmaster would distort their message.  See 530 U. S., at 653 (citing <em>La Follette</em>, 450 U. S., at 123\xe2\x80\x93124).  Nor in <em>Hurley </em>v. <em>Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/557/index.html">515 U. S. 557</a> (1995),<em> </em>did we require the organizers of the St. Patrick\xe2\x80\x99s Day Parade to demonstrate that including a gay contingent in the parade would distort their message.  See <em>id., </em>at 577.  Nor in <em>Jones, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/530/567/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/567/index.html">530 U. S. 567</a>,<em> </em>did we require the political parties to demonstrate either that voters would incorrectly perceive the \xe2\x80\x9cnominee\xe2\x80\x9d labels on the ballot to be the products of party elections or that the labels would change voter perceptions of the party.  It does not take a study to establish that when statements of party connection are the sole information listed next to candidate names on the ballot, those statements will affect voters\xe2\x80\x99 perceptions of what the candidate stands for, what the party stands for, and whom they should elect.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since I conclude that Washington\xe2\x80\x99s law imposes a severe burden on political parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights, I would uphold the law only if it were \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to advance \xe2\x80\x9ca compelling state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Timmons</em>, 520 U. S., at 358.   Neither the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion nor the State\xe2\x80\x99s submission claims that Washington\xe2\x80\x99s law passes such scrutiny.  The State argues only that it \xe2\x80\x9chas a rational basis\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cproviding voters with a modicum of relevant information about the candidates,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners in No. 06\xe2\x80\x93730, pp. 48\xe2\x80\x9349.  This is the only interest the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion identifies as well.  <em>Ante, </em>at 15.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d is the <em>least</em> demanding of our tests; it is the same test that allows individuals to be taxed at different rates because they are in different businesses.  See <em>Allied Stores of Ohio, Inc. </em>v. <em>Bowers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/358/522/index.html">358 U. S. 522</a>, 526\xe2\x80\x93527 (1959).  It falls far, far short of establishing the compelling state interest that the First Amendment requires.  And to tell the truth, here even the existence of a rational basis is questionable.  Allowing candidates to identify themselves with particular parties on the ballot displays the State\xe2\x80\x99s view that adherence to party philosophy is \xe2\x80\x9can important\xe2\x80\x94perhaps paramount\xe2\x80\x94consideration in the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson, </em>375 U. S., at 402.<font b="1">  If that is so, however, it seems to me irrational not to allow the party to disclaim that self-association, or to identify its own endorsed candidate.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is no mystery what is going on here.  There is no state interest behind this law except the Washington Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s dislike for bright-colors partisanship, and its desire to blunt the ability of political parties with noncentrist views to endorse and advocate their own candidates.  That was the purpose of the Washington system that this enactment was adopted to replace\xe2\x80\x94a system indistinguishable from the one we invalidated in <em>Jones</em>, which required parties to allow nonmembers to join in the selection of the candidates shown as their nominees on the election ballot.  (The system was held unconstitutional in <em>Democratic Party of Washington State </em>v. <em>Reed</em>, 343 F.\xc2\xa03d 1198 (CA9 2003).)  And it is the obvious purpose of Washington legislation enacted after this law, which requires political parties to repeat a candidate\xe2\x80\x99s self-declared party \xe2\x80\x9cpreference\xe2\x80\x9d in electioneering communications concerning the candidate\xe2\x80\x94even if the purpose of the communication \nis to criticize the candidate and to disavow any con-\nnection between him and the party.  Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa742.17.510(1) (2006); see also Wash. Admin. Code \xc2\xa7390\xe2\x80\x9318\xe2\x80\x93020 (2007).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if I were to assume, however, that Washington has a legitimate interest in telling voters on the ballot (above all other things) that a candidate <em>says</em> he favors a particular political party; and even if I were further to assume <em>(per impossibile)</em> that that interest was a compelling one; Washington would still have to \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailor\xe2\x80\x9d its law to protect that interest with minimal intrusion upon the parties\xe2\x80\x99 associational rights.  There has been no attempt to do that here.  Washington could, for example, have permitted parties to disclaim on the general-election ballot the asserted association or to designate on the ballot their true nominees.  The course the State has chosen makes sense only as an effort to use its monopoly power over the ballot to undermine the expressive activities of the political parties.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The right to associate for the election of candidates is fundamental to the operation of our political system, and state action impairing that association bears a heavy burden of justification.  Washington\xe2\x80\x99s electoral system permits individuals to appropriate the parties\xe2\x80\x99 trademarks, so to speak, at the most crucial stage of election, thereby distorting the parties\xe2\x80\x99 messages and impairing their endorsement of candidates.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s justification for this (to convey a \xe2\x80\x9cmodicum of relevant information\xe2\x80\x9d) is not only weak but undeserving of credence.  We have here a system which, like the one it replaced, does not merely refuse to assist, but positively impairs, the legitimate role of political parties.  I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Constitution permits this sabotage.</p>\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
