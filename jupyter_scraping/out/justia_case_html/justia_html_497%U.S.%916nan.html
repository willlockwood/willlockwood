During the years at issue here, West Virginia imposed a gross receipts tax on persons selling tangible property at wholesale.  W.Va.Code  11-13-2c (1983).  Local manufacturers were exempt from the tax.  11-13-2.  The West Virginia Tax Department conducted a detailed audit of Ashland\'s tax returns for fiscal years ending September 1975 and 1976 and assessed a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="917">Page 497 U. S. 917</a></p><p> deficiency in tax payments of $181,313.22 for wholesale sales with West Virginia destinations.  Ashland filed a timely petition for reassessment, primarily contending that the tax was unconstitutional as applied, because there was an insufficient connection between its in-state activities and the transactions sought to be taxed.  Juris.Statement 38a.  After the State Tax Commissioner rejected Ashland\'s petition, Ashland appealed to the Circuit Court of Kanawha County.  While the appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Armco, Inc. v. Hardesty,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/638/case.html">467 U. S. 638</a></span> (1984), which invalidated the West Virginia tax scheme that had also been applied against Ashland as discriminatory against interstate commerce.  The State Circuit Court granted Ashland summary judgment on the basis of our decision in <em>Armco.</em></p>\n<p>The West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals reverse, holding that <em>Armco</em> did not apply retroactively, and remanded for further proceedings.  Relying on its state law criteria for retroactivity, <em>see Bradley v. Appalachian Power Co.,</em> 163 W.Va. 332, 256 S.E. 879 (1979), which it considered to "follow closely the analysis employed by the United States Supreme Court in <em>Chevron Oil Co. v.

Rose,</em> 177 W.Va. 20, 23, n. 6, 350 S.E.2d 531, 534, n. 6 (1986), the court determined that <em>Armco</em></p>\n<p>"represented a reversal of prior precedent, and that retroactive application of the <em>Armco</em> rule would cause severe hardship."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 25, 350 S.E.2d at 536.  Accordingly, the court held that the State was not precluded from collecting the gross receipts taxes due for the fiscal years preceding the date of decision in <em>Armco.</em> <em>Id.</em> at 25-26, 350 S.E.2d at 536-537.  We dismissed Ashland\'s appeal of this decision for want of a final judgment.  <em>Ashland Oil, Inc. v. Rose,</em> 481 U.S. 1025 (1987).  On remand, the Circuit Court rejected Ashland\'s remaining claim, and the State Supreme Court of Appeals denied Ashland\'s request for review. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="918">Page 497 U. S. 918</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In its appeal to this Court, Ashland contends, among other claims, that the State Supreme Court of Appeals erred in determining that <em>Armco</em> applied prospectively only.  Because "[t]he determination whether a constitutional decision of this Court is retroactive . . . is a matter of federal law," <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/case.html">496 U. S. 167</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/case.html#177">496 U. S. 177</a></span> (1990), we must examine the state court\'s determination that <em>Armco</em> is not retroactive in light of our nonretroactivity doctrine.</p>\n<p>Applying the view of retroactivity delineated by either the dissent or the plurality in <em>American Trucking Assns.,</em> we must reverse the state court\'s decision.  Under the reasoning of the dissent in <em>American Trucking Assns., Armco</em> applies retroactively to the taxes assessed against Ashland because constitutional decisions apply retroactively to all cases on direct review.  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc. v. Smith, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/case.html#212">496 U. S. 212</a></span> (STEVENS, J., dissenting).  Under the approach of the plurality in <em>American Trucking Assns.,</em> the same result obtains, because <em>Armco</em> fails to satisfy the first prong of the plurality\'s test for determining nonretroactivity.  <em>See Chevron Oil Co. v. Huson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html">404 U. S. 97</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#106">404 U.

In ruling that the tax violated the Commerce Clause, the Court relied on <em>Boston Stock Exchange v.

On its face, West Virginia\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="919">Page 497 U. S. 919</a></p><p> statutory scheme had just such a discriminatory effect, as it</p>\n<p>"provides that two companies selling tangible property at wholesale in West Virginia will be treated differently depending on whether the taxpayer conducts manufacturing in the State or out of it."</p>\n<p><em>Armco, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/638/case.html#642">467 U. S. 642</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court next considered the argument that the State\'s wholesale tax exemption did not discriminate against out-of-state taxpayers because it served as compensation for the imposition of a heavy manufacturing tax on in-state taxpayers.  In <em>Maryland v. Louisiana,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/case.html">451 U. S. 725</a></span> (1981), we held that a tax on an out-of-state event may be considered a nondiscriminatory compensation for a tax on an in-state event when the State</p>\n<p>"is attempting to impose a tax on a substantially equivalent event to assure uniform treatment of goods and materials to be consumed in the State."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/725/case.html#759">451 U.

Applying this test to the West Virginia tax scheme, the Court determined that</p>\n<p>"manufacturing and wholesaling are not \'substantial!y equivalent events\' such that the heavy tax on in-state manufacturers can be said to compensate for the admittedly lighter burden placed on wholesalers from out of State."</p>\n<p><em>Armco,</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/638/case.html#643">467 U.

Instead, the Court asserted that the "internal consistency" test, enunciated in <em>Container Corp. of America v. Franchise Tax Board,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/159/case.html">463 U.

In adopting the internal consistency test, <em>Armco</em> extended that doctrine beyond the context in which it had originated.  <em>See</em> 467 U.S. at <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/638/case.html#648">467 U.

Nevertheless, <em>Armco</em> neither overturned established precedent <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/497/916/case.html">*</a></span> nor decided "an issue of first impression whose resolution was not clearly foreshadowed."  <em>Chevron Oil, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/97/case.html#106">404 U.

Washington State Dept. of Revenue,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/483/232/case.html">483 U.

S. 257</a></span> (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), by extending the internal consistency test.  <em>Armco</em> itself, however, was not revolutionary.  <em>See America Trucking Assns., Inc.

Smith.</em>  Accordingly, the State Supreme Court of Appeals erred in declining to apply <em>Armco</em> retroactively to determine the constitutionality of the State\'s imposition of taxes on Ashland for the years at issue.  The motion of Committee on State Taxation of the Council of State Chambers of Commerce for leave to file a brief as <em>amicus curiae</em> is granted.  We reverse the judgment of the State Circuit Court and remand the case for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* The Court\'s dismissal for want of a substantial federal question of <em>Columbia Gas Transmission Corp.
