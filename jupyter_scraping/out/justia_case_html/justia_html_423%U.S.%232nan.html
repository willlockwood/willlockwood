STEVENS, J., took no part in the consideration or decision of the case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case presents an unresolved issue under \xc2\xa7 16(b) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="234">Page 423 U. S. 234</a></p><p> of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (At), 48 Stat. 896, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78p(b).  That section of the Act was designed to prevent a corporate director or officer or "the beneficial owner of more than 10 per centum" of a corporation [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] from profiteering through short-swing securities transactions on the basis of inside information.  It provides that a corporation may capture for itself the profits realized on a purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of its securities within six months by a director, officer, or beneficial owner. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Section 16(b)\'s last sentence, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="235">Page 423 U. S. 235</a></p><p> however, provides that it</p>\n<p>"shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the security involved. . . ."</p>\n<p>The question presented here is whether a person purchasing securities that put his holdings above the 10% level is a beneficial owner "at the time of the purchase" so that he must account for profits realized on a sale of those securities within six months.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit answered this question in the negative.  506 F.2d 601 (1974).  We affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent, Provident Securities Co., was a personal holding company.  In 1968, Provident decided tentatively to liquidate and dissolve, and it engaged an agent to find a purchaser for its assets.  Petitioner, Foremost-McKesson, Inc., emerged as a potential purchaser, but extensive negotiations were required to resolve a disagreement over the nature of the consideration Foremost would pay.  Provident wanted cash in order to facilitate its dissolution, while Foremost wanted to pay with its own securities.</p>\n<p>Eventually a compromise was reached, and Provident and Foremost executed a purchase agreement embodying their deal on September 25, 1969.  The agreement provided that Foremost would buy two-thirds of Provident\'s assets for $4.25 million in cash and $49.75 million in Foremost convertible subordinated debentures. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The agreement further provided that Foremost would register under the Securities Act of 1933 $25 million in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 423 U. S. 236</a></p><p> principal amount of the debentures and would participate in an underwriting agreement by which those debentures would be sold to the public.  At the closing on October 15, 1969, Foremost delivered to Provident the cash and a $40 million debenture which was subsequently exchanged for two debentures in the principal amounts of $25 million and $15 million.  Foremost also delivered a $2.5 million debenture to an escrow agent on the closing date.  On October 20, Foremost delivered to Provident a $7.25 million debenture representing the balance of the purchase price.  These debentures were immediately convertible into more than 10% of Foremost\'s outstanding common stock.</p>\n<p>On October 21, Provident, Foremost, and a group of underwriters executed an underwriting agreement to be closed on October 28.  The agreement provided for sale to the underwriters of the $25 million debenture.  On October 24, Provident distributed the $15 million and $7.25 million debentures to its stockholders, reducing the amount of Foremost common into which the company\'s holdings were convertible to less than 10%.  On October 28 the closing under the underwriting agreement was accomplished. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Provident thereafter distributed the cash proceeds of the debenture sale to its stockholders and dissolved.</p>\n<p>Provident\'s holdings in Foremost debentures as of October 20 were large enough to make it a beneficial owner of Foremost within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 16. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Having </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 423 U. S. 237</a></p><p> acquired and disposed of these securities within six months, Provident faced the prospect of a suit by Foremost to recover any profits realized on the sale of the debenture to the underwriters.  Provident therefore sued for a declaration that it was not liable to Foremost under \xc2\xa7 16(b).  The District Court granted summary judgment for Provident, and the Court of Appeals affirmed.</p>\n<p>Provident\'s principal argument below for nonliability was based on <em>Kern County Land Co. v. Occidental Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/582/case.html">411 U. S. 582</a></span> (1973).  There, we held that an "unorthodox transaction" in securities that did not present the possibility of speculative abuse of inside information was not a "sale" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 16(b).  Provident contended that its reluctant acceptance of Foremost debentures in exchange for its assets was an "unorthodox transaction" not presenting the possibility of speculative abuse, and therefore was not a "purchase" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 16(b).  Although the District Court\'s pre-<em>Kern County</em> opinion had adopted this type of analysis, 331 F.Supp. 787 (ND Cal.1971), the Court of Appeals rejected it, reasoning that Provident\'s acquisition of the debentures was not "unorthodox," and that the circumstances did not preclude the possibility of speculative abuse.  506 F.2d at 604-605.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals then considered two theories of nonliability based on \xc2\xa7 16(b)\'s exemptive provision:</p>\n<p>"This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale </p><p><a class="page-number" name="238">Page 423 U. S. 238</a></p><p> and purchase. . . ."</p>\n<p>The first was Provident\'s argument that it was not a beneficial owner "at the time of . . . sale."  After the October 24 distribution of some debentures to stockholders, the debentures held by Provident were convertible into less than 10% of Foremost\'s outstanding common stock.  Provident contended that its sale to the underwriters did not occur until the underwriting agreement was closed on October 28.  If this were the case, the sale would not have been covered by \xc2\xa7 16(b), since Provident would not have been a beneficial owner "at the time of . . . sale." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument because it found that the sale occurred on October 21 upon execution of the underwriting agreement. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 423 U. S. 239</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals then turned to the theory of nonliability based on the exemptive provision that we consider here. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  It held that, in a purchase-sale sequence, the phrase "a the time of the purchase" "must be construed to mean prior to the time when the decision to purchase is made."  506 F.2d at 614.  Thus, although Provident became a beneficial owner of Foremost by acquiring the debentures, it was not a beneficial owner "at the time of the purchase."  Accordingly, the exemptive provision prevented any \xc2\xa7 16(b) liability on Provident\'s part.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The meaning of the exemptive provision has been disputed since \xc2\xa7 16(b) was first enacted.  The discussion has focused on the application of the provision to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 423 U. S. 240</a></p><p> a purchase-sale sequence, the principal disagreement being whether "at the time of the purchase" means "before the purchase" or "immediately after the purchase." [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The difference in construction is determinative of a beneficial owner\'s liability in cases such as Provident\'s where such owner sells within six months of purchase the securities the acquisition of which made him a beneficial owner.  The commentators divided immediately over which construction Congress intended, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] and they remain divided. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The Courts of Appeals also are in disagreement over the issue.</p>\n<p>The question of what Congress intended to accomplish by the exemptive provision in a purchase-sale sequence came to a Court of Appeals for the first time in <em>Stella v. Graham-Paige Motors Corp.,</em>232 F.2d 299 (CA2), <em>cert. denied,</em> 352 U.S. 831 (1956).  There, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, without discussion but over a dissent, affirmed the District Court\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 423 U. S. 241</a></p><p> adoption of the "immediately after the purchase" construction.  That court had been impelled to this construction at least in part by concern over what the phrase "at the time of . . . purchase" means in a sale-repurchase sequence, reasoning:</p>\n<p>"If the [\'before the purchase\'] construction urged by [Graham-Paige] is placed upon the exemption provision, it would be possible for a person to purchase a large block of stock, sell it out until his ownership was reduced to less than 10%, and then repeat the process, <em>ad infinitum.</em>"</p>\n<p>104 F.Supp. 957, 959 (SDNY 1952).  The District Court may have thought that "before the purchase" seemed an unlikely construction of the exemptive provision in a sale-repurchase sequence, so it could not be the proper construction in a purchase-sale sequence. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The <em>Stella</em> construction of the exemptive provision has been adhered to in the Second Circuit, <em>Newmark v. RKO General, Inc.,</em> 425 F.2d 348, 355-356, <em>cert. denied,</em> 400 U.S. 854 (1970); [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] <em>Perne v.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 423 U. S. 242</a></p><p> <em>William Norton &amp; Co.,</em> 509 F.2d 114, 118 (1974), and adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  <em>Emerson Electric Co. v. Reliance Electric Co.,</em> 434 F.2d 918, 923-924 (1970), <em>aff\'d on other grounds,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html">404 U. S. 418</a></span> (1972). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  But in none of the foregoing cases did the court examine critically the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 16(b).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals considered this case against the background, sketched above, of ambiguity in the pertinent statutory language, continued disagreement among the commentators, and a perceived absence in the relatively few decided cases of a full consideration of the purpose and legislative history of \xc2\xa7 16(b).  The court found unpersuasive the rationales offered in Stella and its progeny for the "immediately after the purchase" construction.  It noted that construing the provision to require that beneficial ownership status exist before the purchase in a purchase-sale sequence would not foreclose an "immediately after the purchase" construction in a sale-repurchase sequence. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  506 F.2d at 614-615.  More significantly, the Court of Appeals challenged directly the premise of the earlier cases that a "before the purchase" construction in a purchase-sale sequence would allow abuses Congress intended to abate.  The court reasoned that, in \xc2\xa7 16(b), Congress intended to reach only those beneficial owners who both bought and sold on the basis of inside information, which was presumptively </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 423 U. S. 243</a></p><p> available to them only after they became statutory "insiders."  506 F.2d at 608-614. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The general purpose of Congress in enacting \xc2\xa7 16(b) is well known.  <em>See Kern County Land Co.,</em> 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/582/case.html#591">411 U. S. 591</a></span>-592; <em>Reliance Electric Co.,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#422">404 U. S. 422</a></span>, and the authorities cited therein.  Congress recognized that insiders may have access to information about their corporations not available to the rest of the investing public.  By trading on this information, these persons could reap profits at the expense of less well informed investors.  In \xc2\xa7 16(b), Congress sought to</p>\n<p>"curb the evils of insider trading [by] . . . taking the profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed to be intolerably great."</p>\n<p><em>Reliance Electric Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#422">404 U. S. 422</a></span>.  It accomplished this by defining directors, officers, and beneficial owners as those presumed to have access to inside information, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  and enacting a flat rule </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 423 U. S. 244</a></p><p> that a corporation could recover the profits these insiders made on a pair of security transactions within six months. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>Foremost points to this purpose, and invokes the observation in <em>Reliance Electric Co.</em> that,</p>\n<p>"where alternative constructions of the terms of \xc2\xa7 16(b) are possible, those terms are to be given the construction that best serves the congressional purpose of curbing short-swing speculation by corporate insiders."</p>\n<p>404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#424">404 U. S. 424</a></span> (footnote omitted).  From these premises, Foremost argues that the Court of Appeals\' construction of the exemptive provision must be rejected [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] because it makes \xc2\xa7 16(b) inapplicable to some possible abuses of inside information that the statute would reach under the <em>Stella</em> construction. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  We find this approach unsatisfactory in its focus on situations that \xc2\xa7 16(b) may not reach, rather than on the language and purpose of the exemptive provision itself.  Foremost\'s approach also invites an imposition of \xc2\xa7 16(b)\'s liability without fault that is not consistent with the premises upon which Congress enacted the section. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 423 U. S. 245</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>The exemptive provision, which applies only to beneficial owners and not to other statutory insiders, must have been included in \xc2\xa7 16(b) for a purpose.  Although the extensive legislative history of the Act is bereft of any explicit explanation of Congress\' intent, <em>see Reliance Electric Co., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#424">404 U. S. 424</a></span>, the evolution of \xc2\xa7 16(b) from its initial proposal through passage does shed significant light on the purpose of the exemptive provision.</p>\n<p>The original version of what would develop into the Act was S. 2693, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934).  It provided in \xc2\xa7 15(b):</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any director, officer, or owner of securities, owning as of record and/or beneficially more than 5 per centum of any class of stock of any issuer, any security of which is registered on a national securities exchange --"</p>\n<p>"(1) To purchase any such registered security with the intention or expectation of selling the same security within six months; and any profit made by such person on any transaction in such a registered security extending over a period of less than six months shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer, irrespective of any intention or expectation on his part in entering into such transaction of holding the security purchased for a period exceeding six months."</p>\n<p>In the next version of the legislation, H.R. 8720, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934), \xc2\xa7 15(b) read almost identically to \xc2\xa7 16(b) as it was eventually enacted: [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>"Any profit realized by such beneficial owner, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 423 U.

This subsection shall not be construed to cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was not such both at the time of the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of the security involved, nor any transaction or transactions which the Commission by rules and regulations may exempt as not comprehended within the purpose of this subsection of preventing the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by such beneficial owner, director, or officer by reason of his relationship to the issuer."</p>\n<p>Thomas G. Corcoran, a spokesman for S. 2693\'s drafters, explained \xc2\xa7 15(b) as forbidding an insider "to carry on any short-term specu[la]tions in the stock.  He cannot, with his inside information, get in and out of stock within six months."  Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720 before the House Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., 133 (1934).  The Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7 15(b) of S. 2693 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="247">Page 423 U. S. 247</a></p><p> would have applied only to a beneficial owner who had that status before a purchase-sale sequence was initiated, 506 F.2d at 609, and we agree.  Foremost appears not to contest this point.  Brief for Petitioner 29.  The question thus becomes whether H.R. 8720\'s change in the language imposing liability and its addition of the exemptive provision were intended to change S. 2693\'s result in a purchase-sale sequence by a beneficial owner.  We think the legislative history shows no such intent.</p>\n<p>S. 2693 and its House counterpart, H.R. 7852, 73d Cong., 2d Sess. (1934), met substantial criticism on a number of scores, including various provisions of \xc2\xa7 15.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices before the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., pt. 15 (1934); Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720, <em>supra</em> at 1-623. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  S. 2693 was recast into H.R. 8720 to take account of the criticisms that the bill\'s drafters thought valid.  Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720, <em>supra</em> at 625, 674.  The primary substantive criticism directed at \xc2\xa7 15(b) of S. 2693 was that it did not prevent the use of inside information to reap a short-term profit in a sale-repurchase situation.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra</em> at 6557-6558.  Criticism was also directed at making liability for short-term profits turn on ownership "as of record and/or beneficially."  <em>See id.</em> at 6914.  H.R. 8720 remedied these perceived shortcomings by providing in \xc2\xa7 15(b):</p>\n<p>"Any profit realized by such beneficial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="248">Page 423 U. S. 248</a></p><p> owner, director, or officer from any purchase and sale or sale and purchase . . . shall inure to and be recoverable by the issuer. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]"</p>\n<p>The term "such beneficial owner" was defined in \xc2\xa7 15(a) to mean one "who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of more than 5 per centum of any class" of a registered security.</p>\n<p>The structure of the clause imposing liability in the revised \xc2\xa7 15(b) did not unambiguously retain S. 2693\'s requirement that beneficial ownership precede a purchase-sale sequence.  But we cannot assume easily that Congress intended to eliminate the requirement in the revised bill.  The legislative history reveals that the requirement was made clear in the hearings, yet no complaint was made about it.</p>\n<p>The testimony on S. 2693 demonstrates that the drafters were emphatic about the requirement.  In explaining the bill, Corcoran pointed out a technical flaw in S. 2693\'s language:</p>\n<p>"It shall be unlawful for any director, officer, or owner of securities, owning as of record and/or beneficially more than 5 per centum of any class of stock. . . ."</p>\n<p>It was possible to construe the phrase "owning . . . 5 per centum" to apply to directors and officers as well as to mere stockholders, so that trading by directors and officers would not be subject to \xc2\xa7 15(b) if their previous holdings did not exceed 5.  But Corcoran made clear that the requirement of preexisting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 423 U. S. 249</a></p><p> ownership of the specified percentage applied only to beneficial owners.</p>\n<p>"Mr. CORCORAN. . . .  The bill is not very well drawn there.  It ought to read to cover every director, every officer, and every stockholder who owns more than 5 percent of the stock.  That is the way it was intended to read."</p>\n<p>"Mr. MAPES.  It ought to read \'and/or beneficially more than 5 percent\' followed by \'is a director, or officer.\'"</p>\n<p>"Mr. CORCORAN.  It is badly drawn.  We slipped on that.  It ought to read \'every director and every officer\' and then \'every big stockholder.\'"</p>\n<p>Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720, <em>supra</em> at 133.  <em>See</em> Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra,</em> at 6555.</p>\n<p>The legislative record thus, reveals that the drafters focused directly on the fact that S. 2693 covered a short-term purchase-sale sequence by a beneficial owner only if his status existed before the purchase, and no concern was expressed about the wisdom of this requirement.  But the explicit requirement was omitted from the operative language of the section when it was restructured to cover sale-repurchase sequences.  In the same draft, however, the exemptive provision was added to the section.  On this record, we are persuaded that the exemptive provision was intended to preserve the requirement of beneficial ownership before the purchase.  Later discussions of the present \xc2\xa7 16(b) in the hearings are consistent with this interpretation. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  We hold that, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 423 U. S. 250</a></p><p> in a purchase-sale sequence, a beneficial owner must account for profits only if he was a beneficial owner "before the purchase." [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 423 U. S. 251</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Additional considerations support our reading of the legislative history.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 16(b) imposes a strict prophylactic rule with respect to insider, short-swing trading.  In <em>Kern County Land Co.,</em> 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/582/case.html#595">411 U. S. 595</a></span>, we noted:</p>\n<p>"The statute requires the [statutorily defined] inside, short-swing trader to disgorge all profits realized on all \'purchases\' and \'sales\' within the specified time period, without proof of actual abuse of insider information, and without proof of intent to profit on the basis of such information."</p>\n<p>In short, this statute imposes liability without fault within its narrowly drawn limits. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>As noted earlier, Foremost recognizes the ambiguity of the exemptive provision, but argues that, where "alternative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 423 U. S. 252</a></p><p> constructions" of \xc2\xa7 16(b)\'s terms are available, we should choose the construction that best serves the statute\'s purposes.  Foremost relies on statements generally to this effect in <em>Kern County Land Co., supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/582/case.html#595">411 U. S. 595</a></span>, and <em>Reliance Electric Co.,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#424">404 U. S. 424</a></span>.  In neither of those cases, however, did the Court adopt the construction that would have imposed liability, thus, recognizing that serving the congressional purpose does not require resolving every ambiguity in favor of liability under \xc2\xa7 16(b).  We reiterate that nothing suggests that the construction urged by Foremost would serve better to further congressional purposes.  Indeed, the legislative history of \xc2\xa7 16(b) indicates that, by adding the exemptive provision, Congress deliberately expressed a contrary choice.  But even if the legislative record were more ambiguous, we would hesitate to adopt Foremost\'s construction.  It is inappropriate to reach the harsh result of imposing \xc2\xa7 16(b)\'s liability without fault on the basis of unclear language.  If Congress wishes to impose such liability, we must assume it will do so expressly or by unmistakable inference.</p>\n<p>It is not irrelevant that Congress itself limited carefully the liability imposed by \xc2\xa7 16(b).  <em>See Reliance Electric Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#422">404 U. S. 422</a></span>-425.  Even an insider may trade freely without incurring the statutory liability if, for example, he spaces his transactions at intervals greater than six months.  When Congress has so recognized the need to limit carefully the "arbitrary and sweeping coverage" of \xc2\xa7 16(b), <em>Bershad v. McDonough,</em> 428 F.2d 693, 696 (CA7 1970), <em>cert. denied,</em> 400 U.S. 992 (1971), courts should not be quick to determine that, despite an acknowledged ambiguity, Congress intended the section to cover a particular transaction. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 423 U. S. 253</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Our construction of \xc2\xa7 16(b) also is supported by the distinction Congress recognized between short-term trading by mere stockholders and such trading by directors and officers.  The legislative discourse revealed that Congress thought that all short-swing trading by directors and officers was vulnerable to abuse because of their intimate involvement in corporate affairs.  But trading by mere stockholders was viewed as being subject to abuse only when the size of their holdings afforded the potential for access to corporate information. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  These </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 423 U. S. 254</a></p><p> different perceptions simply reflect the realities of corporate life.</p>\n<p>It would not be consistent with this perceived distinction to impose liability on the basis of a purchase made when the percentage of stock ownership requisite to insider status had not been acquired.  To be sure, the possibility does exist that one who becomes a beneficial owner by a purchase will sell on the basis of information attained by virtue of his newly acquired holdings.  But the purchase itself was not one posing dangers that Congress considered intolerable, since it was made when the purchaser owned no shares or less than the percentage deemed necessary to make one an insider. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Such a stockholder is more analogous to the stockholder who never owns more than 10%, and thereby is excluded entirely from the operation of \xc2\xa7 16(b), than to a director or officer whose every purchase and sale is covered by the statute.  While this reasoning might not compel our construction of the exemptive provision, it explains why Congress may have seen fit to draw the line it did.  <em>Cf. Adler v. Klawans,</em> 267 F.2d 840, 845 (CA2 1959). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 423 U. S. 255</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 16(b)\'s scope, of course, is not affected by whether alternative sanctions might inhibit the abuse of inside information.  Congress, however, has left some problems of the abuse of inside information to other remedies.  These sanctions alleviate concern that ordinary investors are unprotected against actual abuses of inside information in transactions not covered by \xc2\xa7 16(b).  For example, Congress has passed general antifraud statutes that proscribe fraudulent practices by insiders.  <em>See</em> Securities Act of 1933, \xc2\xa7 17(a), 48 Stat. 84, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 77q(a); Securities Exchange Act of 134, \xc2\xa7 10(b), 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78j(b); 3 Loss, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, at 1423-1429, 1442-1445.  Today an investor who can show harm from the misuse of material inside information may have recourse, in particular, to \xc2\xa7 10(b) and Rule 10b-5, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.10b-5 (1975). [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  It also was thought that \xc2\xa7 16(a)\'s publicity requirements [<a href="#F30" name="T30">Footnote 30</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 423 U. S. 256</a></p><p> would afford indirect protection against some potential misuses of inside information.

Section 16(d), in part, exempts from \xc2\xa7 16(b) certain transactions by a securities "dealer in the ordinary course of his business and incident to the establishment or maintenance by him of a primary or secondary market." [<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  Section 16(e) provides an exemption for certain "foreign or domestic arbitrage transactions." [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]  They argue similarly that the SEC\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 423 U. S. 258</a></p><p> Rule 16b-2, 17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.16b-2 (1975), is unnecessary if our construction of \xc2\xa7 16(b) is correct.  Rule 16b-2 exempts from \xc2\xa7 16(b) specified transactions in connection with the distribution of a "substantial block of securities." [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 423 U. S. 259</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We do not consider these provisions to be inconsistent with our holding.  Nothing on their faces would make them applicable to one selling the securities the purchase of which made him a beneficial owner.  But the exemptions would be necessary to protect stockholders already qualifying as beneficial owners when they purchased, [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] and they would, of course, apply to transactions by directors and officers as well.</p>\n<p>Foremost and the <em>amicus</em> also remind us that the interpretation of the exemptive provision for which they contend has been adopted by the SEC in the past.  <em>See</em> Brief for SEC as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Reliance Electric Co. v. Emerson Electric Co.,</em> O.T. 1971, No. 779, pp. 22-27.  But the Commission has not appeared as an <em>amicus</em> in this case.  In any event, even if the Commission\'s views have not changed, we would not afford them the deference to which the views of the agency administering a statute are usually entitled, for in <em>Reliance Electric Co.,</em> 404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#425">404 U.

That amount represented a purchase price of 101 1/4% of the principal amount of the debenture ($25,312,500) plus interest accrued from October 15 to the date of closing ($54,166.66).  The amount of profit realized by Provident has never been established.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>A beneficial owner is one who owns more than 10% of an "equity security" registered pursuant to \xc2\xa7 12 of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 781.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra.</em>  The owner of debentures convertible into more than 10% of a corporation\'s registered common stock is a beneficial owner within the meaning of the Act.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3(a)(10), (11) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 78c(a)(10), (11); Rule 16a-2(b), 17 CFR \xc2\xa7 240.16a-2(b) (1975).  Foremost\'s common stock was registered; thus, Provident\'s holdings made it a beneficial owner.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>This contention was based on <em>Reliance Electric Co. v. Emerson Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html">404 U. S. 418</a></span> (1972).  There, the Court held that a sale made after a former beneficial owner had already reduced its holdings below 10% was exempted from \xc2\xa7 16(b) by the phrase "at the time of . . . sale" in the exemptive provision.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F25" name="T25">n</a> 25, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 3(a)(14) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78c(a)(14), defines "sale" and "sell" to include "any contract to sell or otherwise dispose of."  But Provident argued that the October 28 closing date was the day of sale because contractual conditions prevented the contract from becoming binding until closing.  The underwriting agreement provided in paragraph 7:</p>\n<p>"7. Termination of Agreement:  This agreement may be terminated, prior to the time the Registration Statement becomes effective, by you or by any group of Underwriters which has agreed hereunder to purchase in the aggregate at least 50% of the Debentures, if, in your judgment or in the judgment of any such group of Underwriters, there shall have occurred a material unfavorable change in political, financial or economic conditions generally."</p>\n<p>App. A134.  And in paragraph 5, the agreement provided:</p>\n<p>"The several obligations of the Underwriters hereunder are subject to the following conditions:"</p>\n<p>"(h) That, between the time of execution of this agreement and the time of purchase, there shall occur no material and unfavorable change, financial or otherwise (other than as referred to in the Registration Statement and the Prospectus), in the condition of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries as a whole; and the Company will, at the time of purchase, deliver to you a certificate of two of its executive officers to the foregoing effect."</p>\n<p>App. A134.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals agreed that conditions to performance might prevent a contract from being a "sale" prior to closing.  But it ruled that all significant conditions here were satisfied when the registration statement required by paragraph 7 became effective on October 21, the day the underwriting agreement was executed.  The court also found that, after October 21, Provident was no longer subject to the risk of a decline in the market for Foremost\'s stock.  506 F.2d at 607.  For reasons not apparent from its opinion, the court did not address the possibility that paragraph 5(h) left Provident subject to market risks.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F8" name="T8">n</a> 8, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Our holding on this issue disposes of this case by precluding any liability on Provident\'s part.

The sale-repurchase abuse that worried the <em>Stella</em> court would now invite \xc2\xa7 10(b) liability, <em>see</em> <a href="#F29" name="T29">n</a> 29, <em>infra,</em> as well as possible liability under \xc2\xa7 16(b).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>To rationalize its view as applied to the purchase-sale sequence, the court in <em>Newmark</em> wrote:</p>\n<p>"[T]he presumed access to [inside] information resulting from [the] purchase [that makes one a beneficial owner] provides him with an opportunity, not available to the investing public, to sell his shares at the moment most advantageous to him.  Thus, a purchase of shares which makes the buyer an insider creates an opportunity for the type of speculative abuse the statute was enacted to prevent."</p>\n<p>425 F.2d at 356.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>When this Court decided <em>Reliance Electric Co. v.

We express no opinion here on this view.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>Shortly before this case was argued, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reached the same conclusion on somewhat different analysis.  <em>Allis-Chalmers Mfg.

The court apparently would have reached its result even in the absence of the exemptive provision, reasoning that \xc2\xa7 16(b) covers no transactions by any \xc2\xa7 16(b) insiders who were not insiders before their initial transaction.  <em>Id.</em> at 347-348.  Since we rely on the exemptive provision, we intimate no view on the proper analysis of a case where a director or officer makes an initial transaction before obtaining insider status.  <em>See, e.g., Adler v. Klawans,</em> 267 F.2d 840 (CA2 1959).

Formally, the statement of purpose was moved to the front of the statute and various grammatical changes were made.  A significant substantive change not apparent from the faces of the two sections is that \xc2\xa7 16(b) beneficial owners are those owning more than 10% of a registered security, while H.R. 8720 retained S. 2693\'s 5% requirement.  <em>Compare</em> \xc2\xa7 16(a) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 78p(a), <em>with</em> H.R. 8720, 73d Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7 15(a) (1934).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T22" name="F22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>Corcoran termed \xc2\xa7 15 "one of the most important provisions in [S. 2693]."

But most of the proposed legislation was directed at regulation of the stock exchanges themselves and certain trading practices that were considered undesirable regardless of who performed them.  <em>See id.</em> at 6465-6466.  Most of the hearings, therefore, dealt with other problems.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>The other major substantive change effected in \xc2\xa7 15(b) by H.R. 8720 was the elimination of the potential criminal liability.  The criminal liability aspect of S. 2693\'s version of \xc2\xa7 15(b) received almost no attention in hearings.  <em>But cf.</em> Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra,</em> at 6966.  It may have been thought, however, that a criminal case could never be made out.  The difficulties of proving the mental elements on which criminal liability turned had already led the drafters to eliminate those questions of fact in civil suits to recover profits.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F26" name="T26">n</a> 26, <em>infra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>"Mr. PECORA.  The theory was that the ownership of 5 percent of the stock would practically constitute him an insider, and, by virtue of that position, he could acquire confidential information which he might use for his own enrichment by trading in the open market, against the interests of the general body of the stockholders.  That is the main purpose sought to be served."</p>\n<p>Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra,</em> at 7741.  Ferdinand Pecora was counsel to the subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency that conducted extensive hearings on stock exchange operations prior to the enactment of the Act.

Emerson Electric Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html">404 U. S. 418</a></span> (1972), the Court also had occasion to consider the application of the exemptive provision in a purchase-sale sequence.  There, Emerson acquired 13.2% of the shares of Reliance\'s predecessor pursuant to a tender offer, and, within six months, disposed of its holdings in two sales of 3.24% and 9.96%.  The Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit held that the purchase, by which Emerson became a beneficial owner, was covered by \xc2\xa7 16(b).  But it ruled that Emerson was liable for the profits on only its first sale, because, "at the time of . . . sale" of the 9.96%, it was not a beneficial owner.</p>\n<p>The Court granted certiorari on Reliance\'s petition to review this construction of "at the time of . . . sale," and affirmed.  The construction of "at the time of the purchase," however, was not before the Court.  404 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/404/418/case.html#420">404 U. S. 420</a></span>-422.  Emerson thus remained liable for the 3.24% sale, although it would have had no liability under our holding today.  The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has noted correctly that the construction of "at the time of . . . sale" in <em>Reliance Electric Co.</em> is superfluous in light of the construction of "at the time of the purchase" adopted by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which we affirm here.  <em>See Allis-Chalmers Mfg. Co.,</em> 527 F.2d at 348 n. 12.  But the procedural posture of <em>Reliance Electric Co.</em> prevented a full consideration of the meaning of the exemptive provision.  <em>See ibid.</em>  We express no opinion on the interpretation of the provision by which the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit sought to avoid the apparent superfluity of the "at the time of . . . sale" language.  <em>Id.</em> at 348; <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F16" name="T16">n</a> 16.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T26" name="F26">Footnote 26</a>]</p>\n<p>"Mr. CORCORAN. . . .

He might not be."</p>\n<p>Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22, at 6556.  The distinction also is reflected in the discussion of the technical flaw in S. 2693.  <em>See id.</em> at 6555; Hearings on H.R. 7852 and H.R. 8720, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F24" name="T24">n</a> 24, at 133.  <em>See also</em> Hearings on Stock Exchange Practices, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F22" name="T22">n</a> 22, at 7741-7743.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T28" name="F28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p>Thus, according to the presumption of the statute, the purchaser did not have access to inside information in making the purchase.  It should be noted further that, as a matter of practicalities, the crucial point in the acquisition of securities is not the technical "purchase,", but rather the decision to make an acquisition.  In the case of an acquisition of a large block of a corporation\'s stock, that decision may precede the "purchase" by a considerable period of time.  A prudent investor will want to investigate all available information on the corporation.  Such an investor also may need time to finance the purchase, and may wish to effectuate purchases without influencing the market price.  These realities emphasize that the acquisition decision by a beneficial owner normally will occur well in advance of the event that is presumed to afford access to inside information.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T29" name="F29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>Rule 10b-5 has been held to embrace evils that Foremost urges its construction of \xc2\xa7 16(b) is necessary to prevent.  The Rule has been applied to trading by one who acquired inside information in the course of negotiations with a corporation, such as the negotiations for Provident\'s purchase of the Foremost debentures.  <em>Van Alstyne, Noel &amp; Co.,</em> 43 S.E.C. 1080 (1969); 3 Loss, <em>supra,</em> <a href="#F11" name="T11">n</a> 11, at 1451-1452.
