The answers averred the conveyances to be made <em>bona fide,</em> and for a valuable consideration, but after a full hearing of the case, the circuit court (consisting of Judges Iredell and Griffin) delivered the following opinion:</p>\n<p>"That the deeds filed as exhibits in this cause, one dated 20 May, 1793, conveying the goods and chattels in the schedule thereunto annexed to the defendant P.

It is another fact illustrative of this position that "the grantee was a party and privy to the fraud."</p>\n<p>We are therefore of opinion, that the circuit court has sufficiently caused the facts on which they decided to appear from the pleadings and decree in conformity to the act of Congress.</p>\n<p><em>The decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
