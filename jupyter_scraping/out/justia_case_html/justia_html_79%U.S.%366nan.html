From that decree this appeal came.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This case has been twice adjudged against the appellant.  The question presented by the record is purely one of fact, and it is not only clear that the lower courts have done the appellants no wrong, but that the weight and effect of the evidence does not admit of controversy.  In such a state of case, we do not feel called upon, in order to vindicate our judgment, to make any extended comment on the testimony, nor would it serve any useful purpose to do so.  We shall therefore content ourselves with stating the conclusions we have reached concerning the case.</p>\n<p>It is proved that the <em>Lane</em> was in the channel, pursuing the usual course of vessels entering the harbor, while the <em>Spray</em> took an unusual course to effect her object.  In doing this, her master jeoparded his own boat, and through the ground swell caused by the breakers, the <em>Spray</em> was thrown </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 79 U. S. 368</a></p><p> into the <em>Lane,</em> and produced the injury.  But her master had no right, in his eagerness to get ahead of the <em>Lane,</em> to run his boat into breakers, which rendered her unmanageable.  It is conceded that the Lane, being in advance, had the prior right to enter the harbor, but it is urged that her conduct in standing off shore and lowering her mainsail justified the master of the <em>Spray</em> in adopting the conclusion that she did not entertain the purpose of entering the harbor.  It may be true, that while the boat was in this condition, a watchful seaman would have been deceived as to her intention, but this cannot be said after she wore round and headed directly for the harbor.  This change of course was a notification of the actual purpose of the <em>Lane,</em> and was effected time enough for the master of the <em>Spray,</em> if observant, to have avoided the collision.  Instead, however, of going further out into the open sea, as he should have done after this change of course, he continued in the same track he was pursuing, regardless of his own safety or the rights of others.  It is a little singular that he should have been in such a hurry to reach the harbor if in good faith he believed the <em>Lane</em> was bound further down the coast.  But the theory that he thought the schooner ahead was not going into the Little River is an afterthought.  It is clear from the evidence that he supposed this vessel was the <em>Ellen Adelia,</em> and that he knew she was bound for the same port as himself.  And it is equally clear that he wanted to get there in advance of her, if he could, so as to obtain the first load.  It seems that the principal objects of the boats engaged in the Little River trade is to obtain lumber, and that they are often detained there a considerable length of time for want of proper facilities for loading.  Indeed, so limited are these facilities that only one vessel can be loaded at a time, and necessarily the one which arrives first is served first.  With knowledge of this condition of things, and for the purpose of securing the prior right, the master of the <em>Spray</em> ventured upon dangerous ground in order to cut across the schooner, and must suffer the consequences of his own recklessness.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
