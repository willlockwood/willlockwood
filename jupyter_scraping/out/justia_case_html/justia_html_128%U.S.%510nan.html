JUSTICE GRAY, after stating the facts as above, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>By the rules often laid down in former cases, and restated at the last term in <em>Jewell v. Knight,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/426/case.html">123 U. S. 426</a></span>, and at the present term in <em>Fire Insurance Association v. Wickham, ante,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/128/426/case.html">128 U. S. 426</a></span>, this Court cannot take jurisdiction of this case, because, besides the manifest attempt to refer to this Court for decision substantially the whole case by the device of splitting it up into several questions, neither of the questions certified presents a distinct point or proposition of law clearly and precisely stated, but each requires this Court to find out for itself the point intended to be presented by searching through the allegations of the answer and the provisions of the statute relied on by the plaintiff, and by also examining </p><p><a class="page-number" name="514">Page 128 U. S. 514</a></p><p> either the whole constitution of the state or else reports or records of decisions of its courts, referred to in the answer, and made part thereof. The certificate is even more irregular and insufficient than one undertaking to present the question, arising on demurrer or otherwise, whether an indictment, or a count therein, sets forth any offense, which this Court has constantly held not to be a proper subject of a certificate of division of opinion.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/46/208/case.html">United States v.
