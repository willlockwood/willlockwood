And whereas the said James, afterwards, <em>viz.,</em> on 5 April, 1800 (the plaintiff being entitled to have the said land patented to him as aforesaid), without any authority to that effect from the plaintiff and without his knowledge or consent, by means of the said pretended assignment and under color of the same, for his own gain and advantage, and to the great wrong </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 11 U.

And the plaintiff says that the said land was patented to the said Darby and Hughes by the procurement and pretenses of the said James as aforesaid without the plaintiff\'s having ever in any manner authorized, contracted, or consented that the same should be patented in the name of any other person or persons whatsoever other than himself.  And the plaintiff produceth here in court a copy of the said patent. . . ."</p>\n<p>"And whereas, afterwards, on 13 March, 1806, at Alexandria, . . . a conversation was had and propositions for an accord and satisfaction were moved between the said James and the plaintiff concerning a compensation for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the misconduct and wrongdoing of the said James in the premises and of the vesting them, the said Darby and Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid, and it was then and there agreed by the said James on his part, in consideration of the premises and of the just claims of the plaintiff for compensation and damages as aforesaid, that the said James should pay to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the same \xef\xbf\xbd700 Virginia currency, equal to $2,333 1/3, currency of the United States, to be paid in four equal quarterly installments, the first in three months, . . . each installment to be secured by a bond of the said James, and the plaintiff agreed to accept the said \xef\xbf\xbd700 by installments as aforesaid, in full satisfaction of his just claims as aforesaid, and upon the said installments being secured by the bonds of the said James as aforesaid to release and quitclaim to the said James all the plaintiff\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 11 U.

And whereas the defendant had, on 5 April, 1800, in further pursuance of his said intent to prevent the land from being patented to the plaintiff and to cause it to be patented to the said Darby and the defendant, wrongfully and without authority, and under color of being attorney in fact for the plaintiff, caused the land to be patented to the said Darby and the defendant . . . -- and the plaintiff produceth here a copy of the patent, warrant, survey . . . -- and the plaintiff avers that he never authorized the defendant to make the said assignment, and that the defendant knew he had no such authority -- that it was made without the plaintiffs knowledge or consent -- that the plaintiff was, until the issuing of the patent to Darby and the defendant, entitled to have the land patented to himself -- by which wrong doing of the defendant the plaintiff had suffered great wrong and injury and was entitled to be compensated in damages by the defendant, and to be indemnified for being prevented from having the land patented to him, and for the same being patented to Darby and the defendant."</p>\n<p>"And whereas afterwards, on 13 March, 1806, a conversation was had and propositions for a compromise were moved between the plaintiff and defendant touching the compensation and indemnification of the plaintiff, and the defendant then and there agreed in consideration of the just claims of the plaintiff to be compensated for the damage and injury arising from the misconduct of the defendant in the premises, and in consideration of the defendant\'s having procured a patent to be issued to him and Darby for the land, that the defendant would pay to the plaintiff another sum of \xef\xbf\xbd700 Virginia currency of the value, . . . which the plaintiff agreed to accept in satisfaction of his just claims to compensation arising from the causes and considerations last aforesaid, and the defendant in consideration of his said agreement, assumed and promised to the plaintiff that he, the defendant, would perform his part of the agreement.  And the plaintiff in consideration of that promise agreed to accept the \xef\xbf\xbd700 in satisfaction, . . . as aforesaid and upon payment of the same or upon its being secured to be paid in four installments, . . . that he, the plaintiff, would quitclaim and release to the defendant all the plaintiff\'s claims and demands </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 11 U.

The defendant (without again praying oyer), for further plea to each of the counts severally, said that the promise alleged to be made by the defendant to the plaintiff, or any memorandum thereof, was not in writing, signed by the defendant or any other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>3. The defendant, also without again praying oyer, for further plea to each of the counts severally said</p>\n<p>"That after making the agreement and memorandum between the plaintiff and the said John Darby in the declaration mentioned, <em>viz.,</em> on 29 August, 1799, Alexander D.

Orr and John Graham afterwards, <em>viz.,</em> on 29 August, 1799, did say and determine that the plaintiff\'s claim to a survey of 9,922 acres in the County of Washington, being the land in the said agreement and memorandum mentioned, would not sell for \xef\xbf\xbd2,000 Virginia money, and this he is ready to verify. . . .

The defendant also, without again praying oyer, pleaded separately to each count, "that there was not as much land secured by the said location in the agreement mentioned, as would bring \xef\xbf\xbd2,000 or upwards, and this he is ready to verify. . . ."  The plaintiff demurred generally to the second plea, to all the counts, and to the 3d and 4th pleas, to the 2d, 3d and 4th counts.</p>\n<p>To the 3d and 4th pleas to the 1st count, there was a general replication and issue.</p>\n<p>The court below adjudged all the demurrers in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff then entered a <em>nolle prosequi</em> upon the first count of his declaration and waived all the issues joined thereon.  Upon the issues of <em>nonassumpsit</em> to the 2d, 3d and 4th counts there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>After the jury had retired to consider of its verdict, it returned into court and requested the court to determine whether a verdict for the plaintiff would give to the defendant all the right and interest of the plaintiff and his heirs in the patent of land in the declaration mentioned, and the court instructed them that if the plaintiff should recover a judgment in this case, he would be thereby barred in equity from setting aside the patent issued to the defendant and the said John Darby in the declaration mentioned.

And whereas the defendant had on 5 October, 1799 (the plaintiff, being so entitled to have the land patented to him aforesaid, and the defendant well knowing the premises), for his own gain and advantage and to the great wrong and damage of the plaintiff, without any lawful authority to that effect from the plaintiff, and without his knowledge or consent, but under color and pretense of being attorney in fact for the plaintiff, wrongfully, injuriously, and willfully made and executed in the name of the plaintiff, a certain endorsement in writing, upon the back of the said plat and certificate of survey, purporting to be an assignment by the plaintiff, of the said plat and certificate, to one John Darby and the said James Hughes, for value received, and purporting to express a desire of the plaintiff that patents might issue in their names, and purporting to be subscribed with the name of the plaintiff, by the said James Hughes, his attorney in fact.  And whereas the said James, afterwards, <em>viz.,</em> on 5 April, 1800 (the plaintiff being entitled to have the said land patented to him as aforesaid), without any authority to that effect from the plaintiff and without his knowledge or consent, by means of the said pretended assignment and under color of the same, for his own gain and advantage, and to the great wrong </p><p><a class="page-number" name="181">Page 11 U.

And the plaintiff says that the said land was patented to the said Darby and Hughes by the procurement and pretenses of the said James as aforesaid without the plaintiff\'s having ever in any manner authorized, contracted, or consented that the same should be patented in the name of any other person or persons whatsoever other than himself.  And the plaintiff produceth here in court a copy of the said patent. . . ."</p>\n<p>"And whereas, afterwards, on 13 March, 1806, at Alexandria, . . . a conversation was had and propositions for an accord and satisfaction were moved between the said James and the plaintiff concerning a compensation for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the plaintiff by reason of the misconduct and wrongdoing of the said James in the premises and of the vesting them, the said Darby and Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid, and it was then and there agreed by the said James on his part, in consideration of the premises and of the just claims of the plaintiff for compensation and damages as aforesaid, that the said James should pay to the plaintiff in satisfaction of the same \xef\xbf\xbd700 Virginia currency, equal to $2,333 1/3, currency of the United States, to be paid in four equal quarterly installments, the first in three months, . . . each installment to be secured by a bond of the said James, and the plaintiff agreed to accept the said \xef\xbf\xbd700 by installments as aforesaid, in full satisfaction of his just claims as aforesaid, and upon the said installments being secured by the bonds of the said James as aforesaid to release and quitclaim to the said James all the plaintiff\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="182">Page 11 U.

But the defendant refused to perform his part of the agreement, &amp;c."</p>\n<p>4. The 4th count stated that</p>\n<p>"Whereas on 5 October, 1799, the defendant without any lawful authority to that effect, but for his own gain and advantage and to the great wrong and damage of the plaintiff, with intent to prevent the land hereinafter mentioned from being patented to the plaintiff, and to cause and procure the same to be patented to the defendant and one John Darby, wrongfully, injuriously, and willfully made and executed in the name of the plaintiff a certain other endorsement in writing upon a certain other plat and certificate of survey duly made for the plaintiff, on 28 November, 1796, the said survey having been so made in due execution of a certain other warrant duly issued in favor of the plaintiff, from the land office of Virginia on 26 September, 1783, . . . and in pursuance of a location and entry, . . . which last mentioned endorsement purported to be an assignment, . . . from the plaintiff to the said John </p><p><a class="page-number" name="183">Page 11 U.

And the plaintiff in consideration of that promise agreed to accept the \xef\xbf\xbd700 in satisfaction, . . . as aforesaid and upon payment of the same or upon its being secured to be paid in four installments, . . . that he, the plaintiff, would quitclaim and release to the defendant all the plaintiff\'s claims and demands </p><p><a class="page-number" name="184">Page 11 U.

The defendant (without again praying oyer), for further plea to each of the counts severally, said that the promise alleged to be made by the defendant to the plaintiff, or any memorandum thereof, was not in writing, signed by the defendant or any other person by him thereunto lawfully authorized, and this he is ready to verify, &amp;c.</p>\n<p>3. The defendant, also without again praying oyer, for further plea to each of the counts severally said</p>\n<p>"That after making the agreement and memorandum between the plaintiff and the said John Darby in the declaration mentioned, <em>viz.,</em> on 29 August, 1799, Alexander D. Orr, and John Graham, two respectable men residing in the neighborhood of the lands in the said agreement mentioned, were mutually chosen by the plaintiff and the said John Darby to say and determine whether the said lands would sell for two thousand pounds or upwards, and the said Alexander D. Orr and John Graham afterwards, <em>viz.,</em> on 29 August, 1799, did say and determine that the plaintiff\'s claim to a survey of 9,922 acres in the County of Washington, being the land in the said agreement and memorandum mentioned, would not sell for \xef\xbf\xbd2,000 Virginia money, and this he is ready to verify. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="185">Page 11 U. S. 185</a></p><p></p>\n<p>4. The defendant also, without again praying oyer, pleaded separately to each count, "that there was not as much land secured by the said location in the agreement mentioned, as would bring \xef\xbf\xbd2,000 or upwards, and this he is ready to verify. . . ."  The plaintiff demurred generally to the second plea, to all the counts, and to the 3d and 4th pleas, to the 2d, 3d and 4th counts.</p>\n<p>To the 3d and 4th pleas to the 1st count, there was a general replication and issue.</p>\n<p>The court below adjudged all the demurrers in favor of the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The plaintiff then entered a <em>nolle prosequi</em> upon the first count of his declaration and waived all the issues joined thereon.  Upon the issues of <em>nonassumpsit</em> to the 2d, 3d and 4th counts there was a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>After the jury had retired to consider of its verdict, it returned into court and requested the court to determine whether a verdict for the plaintiff would give to the defendant all the right and interest of the plaintiff and his heirs in the patent of land in the declaration mentioned, and the court instructed them that if the plaintiff should recover a judgment in this case, he would be thereby barred in equity from setting aside the patent issued to the defendant and the said John Darby in the declaration mentioned.  To this instruction the defendant excepted, and brought his writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 11 U. S. 189</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows: <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/11/176/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p>Much of the seeming intricacy of this cause will disappear if we extricate the questions made by the pleadings before the Court from others which might greatly embarrass and perplex it.</p>\n<p>The declaration contains four counts.  The first recites an original contract between Cleon Moore and John Darby for the sale of certain lands lying in Kentucky, and proceeds to recount in detail those transactions on which the action was founded.  The other counts state in different terms the several assumpsits which they allege to have been made.</p>\n<p>The defendants crave oyer of the written contract, stated in the first count, and file several pleas to that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="190">Page 11 U. S. 190</a></p><p> count.  They then, without repeating the oyer, file similar pleas to the remaining counts.  After taking issue on some of the pleas, and demurring to others, the plaintiff below discontinues his first count:</p>\n<p>By the counsel for Hughes, this has been considered as error.  But the Court can perceive no reason for this opinion.  After this discontinuance, the parties are in precisely the same situation as if all the issues both of law and fact which were joined upon that count had been decided in favor of the defendant below.  Such decision could not, in point of law, have affected the rights of the parties under the issues joined on the remaining counts, and consequently the discontinuance upon that count must leave those rights unimpaired.  Whether this count remain in the declaration or be stricken out of it, the right of the plaintiff in the circuit court to recover on the other counts will be precisely the same.  The examination of this right must be conducted on the same principles as if the declaration had never contained the first count.</p>\n<p>By the plaintiff in error it is contended that the oyer which was prayed of the written contract alleged in the first count spreads that contract on the record and makes it a part of all his subsequent pleas.  This is certainly true with respect to all his subsequent pleas to that count, but not with respect to his pleas to the other counts.  Different counts allege different contracts and different assumpsits.  It is upon this idea alone that a verdict can be rendered for the plaintiff, on one count and for the defendant on another.  Now the oyer of one contract cannot be the oyer of another contract, and cannot spread upon the record a contract supposed to be totally distinct from that which was read.  The discontinuance of the first count produces no change in this respect in the condition of the parties.  Had it remained, it could have had no influence on the other counts, nor could the oyer of the written contract it stated have transferred that contract to the other counts.</p>\n<p>The second count states that Cleon Moore was owner and proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey for lands lying in Kentucky for which he was entitled to a patent from the government of that state, and that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="191">Page 11 U. S. 191</a></p><p> James Hughes, without authority, transferred that plat and certificate in the name of Cleon Moore to John Darby and the said Hughes, by which wrongful act a patent for the said land was issued to the said Darby &amp; Hughes to the great injury of the said Moore.  That afterwards the said Hughes promised to pay to the said Moore</p>\n<p>"the sum of seven hundred pounds for the said injury, and loss of the said land assigned as aforesaid; the said plaintiff at the same time agreed to the said terms and to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said land and for the injury aforesaid."</p>\n<p>To this count the defendant pleaded several pleas, one of which was that neither the promise nor any memorandum thereof was made in writing.  To this plea the plaintiff demurred, and the court sustained the demurrer.</p>\n<p>The correctness of this decision depends entirely on the application of the statute of frauds to the contract stated in the declaration.</p>\n<p>Cleon Moore is averred to have been the proprietor of a plat and certificate of survey on which Hughes &amp; Darby obtained a patent by using his name without authority.  This tortious act did not divest Moore of his equitable title.  The land, in equity, was his.  Did he part with this title by the contract stated in the declaration?  The answer must, in the opinion of the whole Court, be in the affirmative.  "He agreed to accept of the said compensation in full of all claims and demands for the said land, and for the injury aforesaid."  This, then, was an agreement to sell his equitable title to the land for the sum of seven hundred pounds.  The Court can perceive no distinction between the sale of land to which a man has only an equitable title and a sale of land to which he has a legal title.  They are equally within the statute.</p>\n<p>It is therefore the unanimous opinion of this Court that the judgment upon the demurrer to this plea ought to have been in favor of the defendant below.  This plea being a complete bar to the second count, it is unnecessary to consider the other pleas. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="192">Page 11 U. S. 192</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The third count states the title of Cleon Moore and the injury sustained by him to the same effect with the second count.  It then states a conversation between the parties</p>\n<p>"concerning a compensation for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the said Cleon by reason of the misconduct and wrongdoing of the said James in the premises and of the vesting them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid, and it was then and there agreed by the said James, on his part, in consideration of the premises and of the just claims of the said Cleon for compensation and damages as aforesaid, that the said James should pay to the said Cleon, in satisfaction for the same, the sum of \xef\xbf\xbd700. . . .  And the said Cleon then and there agreed on his part to accept of the said seven hundred pounds in full compensation of his just claims as aforesaid, and, upon the same\'s being secured, &amp;c., to release and quitclaim to the said James, all his, the said Cleon\'s, claims and demands whatsoever, for compensation, redress or damages arising from the wrong doing and misconduct of the said James in the premises, and from the vesting the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land as aforesaid."</p>\n<p>To this count also the statute of frauds was pleaded in bar.  The plaintiff below demurred to the plea, and the defendant joined in demurrer.</p>\n<p>Upon the true construction of the contract stated in this count there was some contrariety of opinion among the judges.  It is, however, the opinion, of the majority that the contract must be understood to import a sale of land, and that the sum of money stipulated to be paid, was, in contemplation of the parties, to extinguish the title of the said Cleon Moore.</p>\n<p>The conversation was "concerning a compensation for the loss and a liquidation of the damages sustained by the said Cleon," not only "by reason of the misconduct of the said Hughes," but also by reason</p>\n<p>"of the vesting them, the said Darby &amp; Hughes, with the legal title to the said land. . . .  And it was then agreed, in consideration of the just claims of the said Cleon for compensation and damages, that the said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="193">Page 11 U. S. 193</a></p><p> James should pay the said Cleon, in satisfaction for the same, the sum of \xef\xbf\xbd700."</p>\n<p>To the majority of the Court it seems that a compensation for the loss of the title to the land must be understood to be a compensation for the land itself, and that the receipt of this money by Cleon Moore would not only have barred an action for damages, but a suit in equity for the title.</p>\n<p>If this opinion be correct, then the contract is substantially for the sale of land, and, to be valid, ought to have been in writing.  On this plea also the demurrer ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p>The fourth count states the injury more in detail than is done in either the second or third counts.  It states the claim of Cleon Moore to be compensated for the loss sustained by his land being granted without his consent to Hughes and Darby.  A conversation was then held, and</p>\n<p>"propositions for a compromise were made touching the compensation and indemnification of him, the said Cleon, . . . and it was then and there agreed by the said James, in consideration of the just claims of the said Cleon to be compensated for the damage and injury for the misconduct of the said James in the premises, and in consideration of the said James having procured and obtained a patent to be completed and issued to the said James, and the said John Darby, as last aforesaid, for the said land,"</p>\n<p>that he, the said James, would well and truly pay the said Cleon, one other sum of \xef\xbf\xbd700.  This the "said Cleon agreed to accept in satisfaction of his just claims to compensation arising from the causes and considerations last aforesaid."</p>\n<p>The compensation here offered and accepted is for the injury sustained by Cleon Moore in consequence of the grant of his land by the State of Kentucky, to Hughes and Darby.  It seems to the Court that this compensation was in lieu of the patent itself, and must have been intended to extinguish his right to that patent.  It is difficult to suppose an intention in this case to receive a full compensation for the loss of a title and yet to retain the right to that title.  The majority of the Court is of opinion that under the contract as stated in this count also, the payment of the money agreed to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="194">Page 11 U. S. 194</a></p><p> paid would have extinguished the right of Cleon Moore to the land in question, and that this contract likewise is substantially a contract for the sale of land.  The demurrer, therefore, to this plea ought to have been overruled.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary to examine other points which were made in the cause.  The judgment of the circuit court must be reversed and judgment rendered for the plaintiff in error.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed.</em></p>\n<p>* It is understood that the opinion of the court below was grounded on the idea that this case was to be governed by the principles relative to implied trusts which are not within the statute of frauds.  Darby &amp; Hughes having obtained the legal estate without the assent of the plaintiff, were to be considered as holding it in trust to secure to him the payment of \xef\xbf\xbd700 in case the land should turn out to be worth \xef\xbf\xbd2,000.  This was an implied trust, resulting from the circumstances of the case, and which would cease to exist upon payment of the \xef\xbf\xbd700.  Upon the plaintiff\'s receiving payment of that sum, his equitable title would cease.  It would not be transferred to the defendant; but would be extinguished.  If the \xef\xbf\xbd700 mentioned in the declaration were to be considered as the compensation for the injury done in depriving the plaintiff of his legal security for \xef\xbf\xbd700 to be paid upon a contingency, it is evident that that injury could not have exceeded \xef\xbf\xbd700.  And whether it were to be paid as compensation for that injury or as the sum which would be due upon the happening of the contingency, it would equally destroy the implied trust.  And as an implied trust can be raised without writing, so, it was thought, it could be extinguished without writing.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
