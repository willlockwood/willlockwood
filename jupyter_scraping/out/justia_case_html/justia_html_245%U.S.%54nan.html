S. 57</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit brought by the City of Louisville, Kentucky, to recover annual taxes for the years 1907 and 1908 in respect of personal property omitted from the original assessments to the owner L. P. Ewald in his lifetime.  The facts, as simplified for the purposes of argument here, are that Ewald was domiciled in Louisville, but continued to carry on a business in St. Louis, Missouri, where he formerly had lived.  Deposits coming in part, if not wholly, from this business were made and kept in St. Louis banks subject to Ewald\'s order alone.  They were not used in the business, and belonged absolutely to him.  The question is whether they could be taken into account in determining the amount of his Louisville tax.  It would seem that some deposits were represented by certificates of deposit, but it was stated at the argument that no point was made of that.  <em>See Wheeler v. Sohmer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/434/case.html">233 U. S. 434</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/434/case.html#438">233 U. S. 438</a></span>.  We are to take it that all the sums are to be dealt with as ordinary bank accounts.  The decision of the state court upheld the tax.  168 Ky. 71, 171 Ky. 509, 172 Ky. 451. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="58">Page 245 U. S. 58</a></p><p></p>\n<p>So far as the present decision is concerned, we may concede, without going into argument, that the Missouri deposits could have been taxed in that state under the decisions of this Court.  <em>Liverpool &amp; London &amp; Globe Ins. Co. v. Orleans Assessors,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/346/case.html">221 U.

But liability to taxation in one state does not necessarily exclude liability in another.  <em>Kidd v. Alabama,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/188/730/case.html">188 U.

S. 13</a></span>.  The present tax is a tax upon the person, as is shown by the form of the suit, and is imposed, it may be presumed, for the general advantages of living within the jurisdiction.  These advantages, if the state so chooses, may be measured more or less by reference to the riches of the person taxed.  Unless it is declared unlawful by authority, we see nothing to hinder the state from taking a man\'s credits into account.  But, so far from being declared unlawful, it has been decided by this Court that whether a state shall measure the contribution by the value of such credits and choses in action, not exempted by superior authority, is the state\'s affair, not to be interfered with by the United States, and therefore that a state may tax a man for a debt due from a resident of another state.  <em>Kirtland v. Hotchkiss,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/100/491/case.html">100 U.

Bank,</a></span></em> 19 Wall. 490.</p>\n<p>It is true that the decision in <em>Kirtland v. Hotchkiss</em> concerned Illinois bonds, and that, if they were physically present in the taxing state, Connecticut, a special principle might apply, as explained in <em>Wheeler v. Sohmer,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/434/case.html">233 U. S. 434</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/233/434/case.html#438">233 U. S. 438</a></span>.  <em>See Commissioner of Stamps v. Hope,</em> [1891] A.C. 476, 486; Dicey, Confl. of Laws, 2d ed., 312.  But the decision was not made to turn upon such considerations; indeed, its reasoning hardly is reconcilable with them or with anything short of a general rule for all debts.  It is argued that, in a later case, this court has held the power of taxation not to extend to chattels permanently </p><p><a class="page-number" name="59">Page 245 U. S. 59</a></p><p> situated outside the jurisdiction, although the owner was within it; <em>Union Refrigerator Transit Co. v. Kentucky,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/199/194/case.html">199 U. S. 194</a></span>, and that the power ought equally to be denied as to debts depending for their validity and enforcement upon a jurisdiction other than that levying the tax.  But this Court has not attempted to press the principle so far, and there is opposed to it the long established practice of considering the debts due to a man in determining his wealth at his domicile for the purposes of this sort of tax.</p>\n<p>The notion that a man\'s personal property upon his death may be regarded as a <em>universitas,</em> and taxed as such, even if qualified, still is recognized both here and in England.  <em>Bullen v.
