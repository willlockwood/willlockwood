Petitioner sued, arguing that the offset was barred by the 10-year statute of limitations of the Debt Collection Act of 1982, 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(e)(1).  The Social Security Act generally exempts benefits from attachment or other legal process, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7407(a), and provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o other provision of law \xe2\x80\xa6 may be construed to \xe2\x80\xa6 modify \xe2\x80\xa6 this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7407(b).  The Higher Education Technical Amendments of 1991 eliminated time limitations on suits to collect student loans, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71091a(a)(2)(D).  In 1996, the Debt Collection Improvement Act subjected Social Security benefits to offset, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding [\xc2\xa7407],\xe2\x80\x9d 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(c)(3)(A)(i).  The District Court dismissed petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The United States may offset Social Security benefits to collect a student loan debt that has been outstanding for over 10 years.

Debt collection by Social Security offset was not authorized until five years after this abrogation of time limits, but the plain meaning of the Higher Education Technical Amendments must be given effect even though Congress may not have foreseen all of its consequences, <em>Union Bank</em> v. <em>Wolas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/151/index.html">502 U.

These loans were eventually reassigned to the Department of Education, which certified the debt to the Department of the Treasury through the Treasury Offset Program.  In 2002, the Government began withholding\na portion of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security payments to\noffset his debt, some of which was more than 10 years delinquent.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner sued in Federal District Court, alleging that under the Debt Collection Act\xe2\x80\x99s 10-year statute of limitations, the offset was time barred.  The District Court dismissed the complaint, and the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed.  376 F.\xc2\xa03d 1027 (2004).  We granted certiorari, 544 U. S. ___ (2005), to resolve the conflict between the Ninth Circuit and the Eighth Circuit, see <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Paige</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa03d 1179 (CA8 2004), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Debt Collection Act of 1982, as amended, provides that, after pursuing the debt collection channels set out in 31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73711(a), an agency head can collect an outstanding debt \xe2\x80\x9cby administrative offset.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73716(a).  The availability of offsets against Social Security benefits is limited, as the Social Security Act, 49 Stat. 620, as amended, makes Social Security benefits, in general, not \xe2\x80\x9csubject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7407(a).  The Social Security Act purports to protect this anti-attachment rule with an express-reference provision:  \xe2\x80\x9cNo other provision of law, enacted before, on, or after April 20, 1983, may be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7407(b).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Debt Collection Act\xe2\x80\x99s offset provisions generally do not authorize the collection of claims which, like petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s debts at issue here, are over 10 years old.  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(e)(1).  In 1991, however, the Higher Education Technical Amendments, 105 Stat. 123, sweepingly eliminated time limitations as to certain loans:  \xe2\x80\x9cNotwithstanding any other provision of statute . . . no limitation shall terminate the period within which suit may be filed, a judgment may be enforced, or an offset, garnishment, or other action initiated or taken,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71091a(a)(2), for the repayment of various student loans, including the loans at issue here, \xc2\xa71091a(a)(2)(D).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Higher Education Technical Amendments, by their terms, did not make Social Security benefits subject to offset; these were still protected by the Social Security Act\xe2\x80\x99s anti-attachment rule.  Only in 1996 did the Debt Collection Improvement Act\xe2\x80\x94in amending and recodifying the Debt Collection Act\xe2\x80\x94provide that, \xe2\x80\x9c[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law (including [\xc2\xa7407] \xe2\x80\xa6 ),\xe2\x80\x9d with a limited exception not relevant here, \xe2\x80\x9call payment due an individual under \xe2\x80\xa6 the Social Security Act \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be subject to offset under this section.\xe2\x80\x9d  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73716(c)(3)(A)(i).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government does not contend that the \xe2\x80\x9cnotwithstanding\xe2\x80\x9d clauses in both the Higher Education Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act trump the Social Security Act\xe2\x80\x99s express-reference provision.  Cf. <em>Marcello</em> v. <em>Bonds,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/302/index.html">349 U. S. 302</a>, 310 (1955) (\xe2\x80\x9cExemptions from the terms of the \xe2\x80\xa6 Act are not lightly to be presumed in view of the statement \xe2\x80\xa6 that modifications must be express[.]  But \xe2\x80\xa6 [u]nless we are to require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the \xe2\x80\xa6 Act, we must hold that the present statute expressly supersedes the \xe2\x80\xa6 provisions of that Act\xe2\x80\x9d  (citation omitted)); <em>Great Northern R. Co.</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/452/index.html">208 U. S. 452</a>, 465 (1908).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We need not decide the effect of express-reference provisions such as \xc2\xa7407(b) to resolve this case.  Because the Debt Collection Improvement Act clearly makes Social Security benefits subject to offset, it provides exactly the sort of express reference that the Social Security Act says is necessary to supersede the anti-attachment provision.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear that the Higher Education Technical Amendments remove the 10-year limit that would otherwise bar offsetting petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security benefits to pay off his student loan debt.  Petitioner argues that Congress could not have intended in 1991 to repeal the Debt Collection Act\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations as to offsets against Social Security benefits\xe2\x80\x94since debt collection by Social Security offset was not authorized until five years later.  Therefore, petitioner continues, the Higher Education Technical Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 abrogation of time limits in 1991 only applies to then-valid means of debt collection.  We disagree.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that Congress may not have foreseen all of the consequences of a statutory enactment is not a sufficient reason for refusing to give effect to its plain meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Union Bank</em> v. <em>Wolas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/151/index.html">502 U. S. 151</a>, 158 (1991).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner points out that the Higher Education Technical Amendments, unlike the Debt Collection Improvement Act, do not explicitly mention \xc2\xa7407.  But \xc2\xa7407(b) only requires an express reference to authorize attachment in the first place\xe2\x80\x94which the Debt Collection Improvement Act has already provided.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the Debt Collection Improvement Act\xe2\x80\x99s 1996 recodification of the Debt Collection Act help petitioner.  The Debt Collection Improvement Act, in addition to adding offset authority against Social Security benefits, retained the Debt Collection Act\xe2\x80\x99s general 10-year bar on offset authority.  But the mere retention of this previously enacted time bar does not make the time bar apply in all contexts\xe2\x80\x94a result that would extend far beyond Social Security benefits, since it would imply that the Higher Education Technical Amendments\xe2\x80\x99 abrogation of time limits was now a dead letter as to any kind of administrative offset.  Rather, the Higher Education Technical Amendments retain their effect as a limited exception to the Debt Collection Act time bar in the student loan\ncontext.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we decline to read any meaning into the failed 2004 effort to amend the Debt Collection Act to explicitly authorize offset of debts over 10 years old.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. 5025, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7642 (Sept. 8, 2004); S. 2806, 108th Cong., 2d Sess., \xc2\xa7642 (Sept. 15, 2004).  \xe2\x80\x9c[F]ailed legislative proposals are \xe2\x80\x98a particularly dangerous ground on which to rest an interpretation of a prior statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Craft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/274/index.html">535 U.

In any event, it is unclear what meaning we could read into this effort even if we were inclined to do so, as the failed amendment\xe2\x80\x94which was not limited to offsets against Social Security benefits\xe2\x80\x94would have had a different effect than the interpretation we advance today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Therefore, we affirm the judgment of the Ninth Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962004">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSCALIA, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nLOCKHART V.

Thus, in <em>Marcello</em> v. <em>Bonds</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/302/index.html">349 U. S. 302</a> (1955), we interpreted the Immigration and Nationality Act as impliedly exempting deportation hearings from the procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), despite the requirement in \xc2\xa712 of the APA that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o subsequent legislation shall be held to supersede or modify the provisions of this Act except to the extent that such legislation shall do so expressly,\xe2\x80\x9d 60 Stat. 244.  The Court refused \xe2\x80\x9cto require the Congress to employ magical passwords in order to effectuate an exemption from the Administrative Procedure Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  349 U. S., at 310.  We have made clear in other cases as well, that an express-reference or express-statement provision cannot nullify the unambiguous import of a subsequent statute.  In <em>Great Northern R. Co.</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/208/452/index.html">208 U. S. 452</a>, 465 (1908), we said of an express-statement requirement that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s the section \xe2\x80\xa6 in question has only the force of a statute, its provisions cannot justify a disregard of the will of Congress as manifested either expressly <em>or by necessary implication</em> in a subsequent enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  A subsequent Congress, we have said, may exempt itself from such requirements by \xe2\x80\x9cfair implication\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, <em>without</em> an express statement.  <em>Warden</em> v. <em>Marrero</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/417/653/index.html">417 U.

S. 205</a>, 218 (1910).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To be sure, legislative express-reference or express-statement requirements may function as background canons of interpretation of which Congress is presumptively aware.  For example, we have asserted that exemptions from the APA are \xe2\x80\x9cnot lightly to be presumed\xe2\x80\x9d in light of its express-reference requirement, <em>Marcello</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 310; see also <em>Shaughnessy</em> v. <em>Pedreiro</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/349/48/index.html">349 U. S. 48</a>, 51 (1955).  That assertion may add little or nothing to our already-powerful presumption against implied repeals.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cWe have repeatedly stated . . . that absent a clearly established congressional intention, repeals by implication are not favored.  An implied repeal will only be found where provisions in two statutes are in irreconcilable conflict, or where the latter Act covers the whole subject of the earlier one and is clearly intended as a substitute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Branch</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/254/index.html">538 U. S. 254</a>, 273 (2003) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>Morton</em> v. <em>Mancari</em>, 417 U. S.535, 551 (1974).  When the plain import of a later statute directly conflicts with an earlier statute, the later enactment governs, <em>regardless</em> of its compliance with any earlier-enacted requirement of an express reference or other \xe2\x80\x9cmagical password.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons set forth in the majority opinion, in the Higher Education Technical Amendments and the Debt Collection Improvement Act, Congress unambiguously authorized, without exception, the collection of 10-year-old student-loan debt by administrative offset of Government payments.  In doing so, it flatly contradicted, and thereby effectively repealed, part of \xc2\xa7207(a) of the Social Security Act.  This repeal is effective, regardless of whether the express-reference requirement of \xc2\xa7207(b) is fulfilled.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite our jurisprudence on this subject, it is regrettably not uncommon for Congress to attempt to burden the future exercise of legislative power with express-reference and express-statement requirements.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 1 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7109; 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7559; 25 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71735(b); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x933(b); 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71547(a)(1), 1621(b).  In the present case, it might seem more respectful of Congress to refrain from declaring the invalidity of the express-reference provision.  I suppose that would depend upon which Congress one has in mind: the prior one that enacted the provision, or the current one whose clearly expressed legislative intent it is designed to frustrate.  In any event, I think it does no favor to the Members of Congress, and to those who assist in drafting their legislation, to keep secret the fact that such express-reference provisions are ineffective.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
