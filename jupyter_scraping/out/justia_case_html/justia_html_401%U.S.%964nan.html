The petition for a writ of certiorari is denied. </p><p> Mr. Justice DOUGLAS, with whom Mr. Justice BRENNAN concurs, dissenting. Prior to petitioner\'s trial for armed robbery, the trial judge appointed a psychiatrist at petitioner\'s request to conduct an examination into petitioner\'s competency to stand trial. He apparently was found competent. At trial the State produced evidence of the robbery and an exchange of gunfire. A number of witnesses identified petitioner as the gunman. Petitioner\'s defense was that he had taken some pills and had drunk some alcohol prior to the robbery and remembered nothing from the time he took the pills until the time he awoke in the station house. In rebuttal the State called the examining psychiatrist who testified that petitioner had told him a very logical and complete story of what had happened during the afternoon of the robbery. The defense moved to strike the testimony on the grounds that the psychiatrist-patient privilege accorded by Georgia law* barred the testimony. The trial judge denied the motion and the Supreme Court of Georgia affirmed stating: </p><ul>\'The psychiatrist appointed by the court for a sanity examination of the defendant may not be regarded as a prosecution witness, but is instead a witness for the court. ...
