JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question presented in this case is whether the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act precludes terminally ill cancer patients from obtaining Laetrile, a drug not recognized as "safe and effective" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) of the Act, 52 Stat. 1041, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 321 (p)(1).</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, 52 Stat. 1052, as amended, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 355, prohibits interstate distribution of any "new drug" unless the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare approves an application supported by substantial evidence of the drug\'s safety and effectiveness.

However, it instructed the District Court to remand the case to the Food and Drug Administration for determination whether Laetrile was a "new drug" under \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1), and, if so, whether it was exempt from premarketing approval under either of the Act\'s grandfather clauses.  542 F.2d 1137 (1976).</p>\n<p>After completion of administrative hearings, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] the Commissioner issued his opinion on July 29, 1977.  42 Fed.Reg. 39768 (1977).  He determined first that no uniform definition of Laetrile exists; rather, the term has been used generically for chemical compounds similar to, or consisting at least in part of, amygdalin, a glucoside present in the kernels or seeds of most fruits.  <em>Id.</em> at 39770-39772.  The Commissioner further found that Laetrile in its various forms constituted a "new drug" as defined in \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) of the Act, because it was not generally recognized among experts as safe and effective for its prescribed use.  <em>See</em> 42 Fed.Reg. 39775-39787 (1977).  In so ruling, the Commissioner applied the statutory criteria delineated in <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/609/case.html">412 U.

[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="550">Page 442 U. S. 550</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Having determined that Laetrile was a new drug, the Commissioner proceeded to consider whether it was exempt from premarketing approval under the 1938 or 1962 grandfather provisions.  On the facts presented, the Commissioner found that Laetrile qualified under neither clause.  <em>See id.</em> at 39787-39795.  First, there was no showing that the drug currently known as Laetrile was identical in composition or labeling to any drug distributed before 1938.  <em>See</em> 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 321(p)(1); n. 3, <em>supra.</em>  Nor could the Commissioner conclude from the evidence submitted that, as of October 9, 1962, Laetrile in its present chemical composition was commercially used or sold in the United States, was generally recognized by experts as safe, and was labeled for the same recommended uses as the currently marketed drug.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 789; n. 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>On review of the Commissioner\'s decision, the District Court sustained his determination that Laetrile, because not generally regarded as safe or effective, constituted a new drug under \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1).  438 F.Supp. 1287, 1293-1294 (WD Okla.1977).  The court also approved the Commissioner\'s denial of an exemption under the 1938 grandfather clause.  However, concluding that the record did not support the Commissioner\'s findings as to the 1962 grandfather provision, the District Court ruled that Laetrile was entitled to an exemption from premarketing approval requirements.  <em>Id.</em> at 1294-1298.  Alternatively, the court held that, by denying cancer patients the right to use a nontoxic substance in connection with their personal health, the Commissioner had infringed constitutionally protected privacy interests.  <em>Id.</em> at 1298-1300.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals addressed neither the statutory nor the constitutional rulings of the District Court.  Rather, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="551">Page 442 U. S. 551</a></p><p> Tenth Circuit held that "the <em>safety\' and `effectiveness\' terms used in the statute have no reasonable application to terminally ill cancer patients."  582 F.2d 1234, 1236 (1978).  Since those patients, by definition, would "die of cancer regardless of what may be done," the court concluded that there were no realistic standards against which to measure the safety and effectiveness of a drug for that class of individuals.  <em>Id.</em> at 1237.  The Court of Appeals therefore approved the District Court\'s injunction permitting use of Laetrile by cancer patients certified as terminally ill.  However, presumably because the Commissioner had found some evidence that Laetrile was toxic when orally administered, <em>see</em> 42 Fed.Reg. 39786-39787 (1977), the Court of Appeals limited relief to intravenous injections for patients under a doctor\'s supervision.  582 F.2d at 1237.  In addition, the court directed the FDA to promulgate regulations "as if" the drug had been found "`safe\' and `effective\'" for terminally ill cancer patients.  <em>Ibid.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 439 U.S. 1127 (1979), and now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act makes no special provision for drugs used to treat terminally ill patients.  By its terms, \xc2\xa7 505 of the Act requires premarketing approval for "any new drug" unless it is intended solely for investigative use or is exempt under one of the Act\'s grandfather provisions.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a> <a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a> <em>supra.</em>  And \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) defines "new drug" to encompass</p>\n<p>"[a]ny drug . . . not generally recognized . . . as safe and effective for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the labeling."</p>\n<p><em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/544/case.html#546">442 U.

In the instant case, we are persuaded by the legislative history and consistent administrative interpretation of the Act that no implicit exemption for drugs used by the terminally ill is necessary to attain congressional objectives or to avert an unreasonable reading of the terms "safe" and "effective" in \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1).</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Nothing in the history of the 1938 Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which first established procedures for review of drug safety, or of the 1962 Amendments, which added the current safety and effectiveness standards in \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1), [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] suggests that Congress intended protection only for persons suffering from curable diseases.  To the contrary, in deliberations preceding the 1938 Act, Congress expressed concern that individuals with fatal illnesses, such as cancer, should be shielded from fraudulent cures.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 79 Cong.Rec. 5023 (1935) (remarks of Sen. Copeland, sponsor of the Act); 83 Cong.Rec. 7786-7787, 7789 (1938) (remarks of Reps. Phillips and Lea).  Similarly, proponents of the 1962 Amendments to the Act, including Senator Kefauver, one of the bill\'s sponsors, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="553">Page 442 U. S. 553</a></p><p> indicated an understanding that experimental drugs used to treat cancer "in its last stages" were within the ambit of the statute.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> 108 Cong.Rec. 17399 (1962) (remarks of Sen. Kefauver); <em>id.</em> at 17401 (comments of Sen. Eastland).  That same understanding is reflected in the Committee Reports on the 1962 Amendments.  Both Reports note with approval the FDA\'s policy of considering effectiveness when passing on the safety of drugs prescribed for "life-threatening disease." [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>In implementing the statutory scheme, the FDA has never made exception for drugs used by the terminally ill.  As this Court has often recognized, the construction of a statute by those charged with its administration is entitled to substantial deference.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/234/case.html">Board of Governors of FRS v.

Here, however, we have no license to depart from the plain language of the Act, for Congress could reasonably have intended to shield terminal patients from ineffectual or unsafe drugs.</p>\n<p>A drug is effective within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) if there is general recognition among experts, founded on substantial evidence, that the drug in fact produces the results claimed for it under prescribed conditions.  <em>See Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc.,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/609/case.html#629">412 U. S. 629</a></span>-634;  <a href="#F7" name="T7">n</a> 7, <em>supra.</em>  Contrary to the Court of Appeals\' apparent assumption, <em>see</em> 582 F.2d at 1236, effectiveness does not necessarily denote capacity to cure.  In the treatment of any illness, terminal or otherwise, a drug is effective if it fulfills, by objective indices, its sponsor\'s claims of prolonged life, improved physical condition, or reduced pain.  <em>See</em> 42 Fed.Reg. 39776-39786 (1977).</p>\n<p>So too, the concept of safety under \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) is not without meaning for terminal patients.  Few if any drugs are completely safe in the sense that they may be taken by all persons in all circumstances without risk. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, the Commissioner generally considers a drug safe when the expected therapeutic gain justifies the risk entailed by its use. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  For </p><p><a class="page-number" name="556">Page 442 U. S. 556</a></p><p> the terminally ill, as for anyone else, a drug is unsafe if its potential for inflicting death or physical injury is not offset by the possibility of therapeutic benefit.  Indeed, the Court of Appeals implicitly acknowledged that safety considerations have relevance for terminal cancer patients by restricting authorized use of Laetrile to intravenous injections for persons under a doctor\'s supervision.  <em>See</em> 582 F.2d at 1237; <em>supra</em> at 551.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there is a special sense in which the relationship between drug effectiveness and safety has meaning in the context of incurable illnesses.  An otherwise harmless drug can be dangerous to any patient if it does not produce its purported therapeutic effect.  <em>See</em> 107 Cong.Rec. 5640 (1961) (comments of Sen. Kefauver).  But if an individual suffering from a potentially fatal disease rejects conventional therapy in favor of a drug with no demonstrable curative properties, the consequences can be irreversible. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  For this reason, even before the 1962 Amendments incorporated an efficacy standard into new drug application procedures, the FDA considered effectiveness when reviewing the safety of drugs used to treat terminal illness.  <em>See</em> nn.  <a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a> <a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a> <em>supra.</em>  The FDA\'s practice also reflects the recognition, amply supported by expert medical testimony in this case, that, with diseases such as cancer, it is often impossible to identify a patient as terminally ill except in retrospect. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Cancers vary considerably in behavior </p><p><a class="page-number" name="557">Page 442 U. S. 557</a></p><p> and in responsiveness to different forms of therapy.  <em>See</em> 42 Fed.Reg. 39777 (1977). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Even critically ill individuals may have unexpected remissions, and may respond to conventional treatment.  <em>Id.</em> at 39777, 39805.  Thus, as the Commissioner concluded, to exempt from the Act drugs with no proved effectiveness in the treatment of cancer</p>\n<p>"would lead to needless deaths and suffering among . . . patients characterized as \'terminal\' who could actually be helped by legitimate therapy."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 39805.</p>\n<p>It bears emphasis that, although the Court of Appeals\' ruling was limited to Laetrile, its reasoning cannot be so readily confined.  To accept the proposition that the safety and efficacy standards of the Act have no relevance for terminal patients is to deny the Commissioner\'s authority over all drugs, however </p><p><a class="page-number" name="558">Page 442 U. S. 558</a></p><p> toxic or ineffectual, for such individuals.  If history is any guide, this new market would not be long overlooked.  Since the turn of the century, resourceful entrepreneurs have advertised a wide variety of purportedly simple and painless cures for cancer, including liniments of turpentine, mustard, oil, eggs, and ammonia; peat moss; arrangements of colored floodlamps; pastes made from glycerin and limburger cheese; mineral tablets; and "Fountain of Youth" mixtures of spices, oil, and suet. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In citing these examples, we do not, of course, intend to deprecate the sincerity of Laetrile\'s current proponents, or to imply any opinion on whether that drug may ultimately prove safe and effective for cancer treatment.  But this historical experience does suggest why Congress could reasonably have determined to protect the terminally ill, no less than other patients, from the vast range of self-styled panaceas that inventive minds can devise.</p>\n<p>We note finally that construing \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) to encompass treatments for terminal diseases does not foreclose all resort to experimental cancer drugs by patients for whom conventional therapy is unavailing.  Section 505(i) of the Act, 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 355(i), exempts from premarketing approval drugs intended solely for investigative use if they satisfy certain preclinical testing and other criteria. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  An application for clinical testing of Laetrile by the National Cancer Institute is now pending before the Commissioner.  Brief for United States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="559">Page 442 U. S. 559</a></p><p> 35 n. 23.  That the Act makes explicit provision for carefully regulated use of certain drugs not yet demonstrated safe and effective reinforces our conclusion that no exception for terminal patients may be judicially implied.  Whether, as a policy matter, an exemption should be created is a question for legislative judgment, not judicial inference.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

This exemption is currently contained in \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1) of the Act, as codified in 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 321(p)(1).  The Drug Amendments of 1962 added a second grandfather clause, which provides:</p>\n<p>"In the case of any drug which, on the day immediately preceding the enactment date [October 10, 1962], (A) was commercially used or sold in the United States, (b) was not a new drug as defined by section 201(p) of the basic Act as then in force, and (C) was not covered by an effective [new drug] application under section 505 of that Act, the amendments to section 201(p) made by this Act shall not apply to such drug when intended solely for use under conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in labeling with respect to such drug on that day."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 107(c)(4), 76 Stat. 789.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>The suit was originally instituted by a cancer patient, Juanita Stowe, and her husband, Jimmie Stowe.

However, based on the structure and purpose of the statutory scheme, this Court, in <em>Weinberger v. Hynson, Westcott &amp; Dunning, Inc.,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/609/case.html#629">412 U.

The Drug Amendments of 1962, Pub.L. 87-781, 76 Stat. 789, redefined the term to include drugs not generally recognized as effective or safe for their intended use.  \xc2\xa7 201(p)(1), 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 321(p)(1).  <em>See supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/544/case.html#546">442 U.

In addition, the Amendments provided that no new drug application may be approved absent substantial evidence that the drug is effective as well as safe under prescribed conditions.  \xc2\xa7 505(d), 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 355(d).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The Senate Report states:</p>\n<p>"The Food and Drug Administration now requires, in determining whether a \'new drug\' is safe, a showing as to the drug\'s effectiveness where the drug is offered for use in the treatment of a life-threatening disease, or where it appears that the \'new drug\' will occasionally produce serious toxic or even lethal effects, so that only its usefulness would justify the risks involved in its use.  In such cases, the determination of safety is, in the light of the purposes of the new drug provisions, considered by the Food and Drug Administration to be inseparable from consideration of the drug\'s effectiveness.

But once an agency\'s statutory construction has been "fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress," and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation, although it has amended the statute in other respects, then presumably the legislative intent has been correctly discerned.  <em>Apex Hosiery Co. v.
