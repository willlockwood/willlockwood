At the time of the crash, the plane was registered in Great Britain and was owned and operated by companies organized in the United Kingdom.  The pilot and all of the decedents\' heirs and next of kin were Scottish subjects and citizens, and the investigation of the accident was conducted by British authorities.  Respondent sought to recover from petitioners on the basis of negligence or strict liability (not recognized by Scottish law), and admitted that the action was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to respondent\'s position than those of Scotland.  On petitioners\' motion, the action was removed to a Federal District Court in California and was then transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1404(a).

If substantial weight were given to the possibility of an unfavorable change in law, however, dismissal might be barred even where trial in the chosen forum was plainly inconvenient, and the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine would become virtually useless.  Such an approach not only would be inconsistent with the purpose of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine, but also would pose substantial practical problems, requiring that trial courts determine complex problems in conflict of laws and comparative law, and increasing the flow into American courts of litigation by foreign plaintiffs against American manufacturers.

The District Court properly decided that the presumption in favor of the plaintiff\'s forum choice applied with less than maximum force when the plaintiff or (as here) the real parties in interest are foreign.

Even aside from the question whether Scottish law might be applicable in part, all other public interest factors favor trial in Scotland, which has a very strong interest in this litigation.  The accident occurred there, all of the decedents were Scottish, and apart from petitioners, all potential parties are either Scottish or English.  As to respondent\'s argument that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products and that additional deterrence might be obtained by trial in the United States where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability, any incremental deterrence from trial in an American court is likely to be insignificant and is not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would be required.

Respondent, acting as representative of the estates of several Scottish citizens killed in the accident, brought wrongful death actions against petitioners that were ultimately transferred to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Petitioners moved to dismiss on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em>  After noting that an alternative forum existed in Scotland, the District Court granted their motions.  479 F.Supp. 727 (1979).  The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed.  630 F.2d 149 (1980).  The Court of Appeals based its decision, at least in part, on the ground that dismissal is automatically barred where the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff than the law of the forum chosen by the plaintiff.  Because we conclude that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law should not, by itself, bar dismissal, and because we conclude that the District Court did not otherwise abuse its discretion, we reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>In July, 1976, a small commercial aircraft crashed in the Scottish highlands during the course of a charter flight from </p><p><a class="page-number" name="239">Page 454 U. S. 239</a></p><p> Blackpool to Perth.  The pilot and five passengers were killed instantly.  The decedents were all Scottish subjects and residents, as are their heirs and next of kin.  There were no eyewitnesses to the accident.  At the time of the crash, the plane was subject to Scottish air traffic control.</p>\n<p>The aircraft, a twin-engine Piper Aztec, was manufactured in Pennsylvania by petitioner Piper Aircraft Co. (Piper).  The propellers were manufactured in Ohio by petitioner Hartzell Propeller, Inc. (Hartzell).  At the time of the crash, the aircraft was registered in Great Britain and was owned and maintained by Air Navigation and Trading Co., Ltd. (Air Navigation).  It was operated by McDonald Aviation, Ltd. (McDonald), a Scottish air taxi service.  Both Air Navigation and McDonald were organized in the United Kingdom.  The wreckage of the plane is now in a hangar in Farnsborough, England.</p>\n<p>The British Department of Trade investigated the accident shortly after it occurred.  A preliminary report found that the plane crashed after developing a spin, and suggested that mechanical failure in the plane or the propeller was responsible.  At Hartzell\'s request, this report was reviewed by a three-member Review Board, which held a 9-day adversary hearing attended by all interested parties.  The Review Board found no evidence of defective equipment and indicated that pilot error may have contributed to the accident.  The pilot, who had obtained his commercial pilot\'s license only three months earlier, was flying over high ground at an altitude considerably lower than the minimum height required by his company\'s operations manual.</p>\n<p>In July, 1977, a California probate court appointed respondent Gaynell Reyno administratrix of the estates of the five passengers.  Reyno is not related to and does not know any of the decedents or their survivors; she was a legal secretary to the attorney who filed this lawsuit.  Several days after her appointment, Reyno commenced separate wrongful </p><p><a class="page-number" name="240">Page 454 U. S. 240</a></p><p> death actions against Piper and Hartzell in the Superior Court of California, claiming negligence and strict liability. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Air Navigation, McDonald, and the estate of the pilot are not parties to this litigation.  The survivors of the five passengers whose estates are represented by Reyno filed a separate action in the United Kingdom against Air Navigation, McDonald, and the pilot\'s estate. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Reyno candidly admits that the action against Piper and Hartzell was filed in the United States because its laws regarding liability, capacity to sue, and damages are more favorable to her position than are those of Scotland.  Scottish law does not recognize strict liability in tort.  Moreover, it permits wrongful death actions only when brought by a decedent\'s relatives.  The relatives may sue only for "loss of support and society." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>On petitioners\' motion, the suit was removed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  Piper then moved for transfer to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1404(a). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Hartzell moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, or in the alternative, to transfer. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In December, 1977, the District Court quashed service on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="241">Page 454 U. S. 241</a></p><p> Hartzell and transferred the case to the Middle District of Pennsylvania.  Respondent then properly served process on Hartzell.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>In May, 1978, after the suit had been transferred, both Hartzell and Piper moved to dismiss the action on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em>  The District Court granted these motions in October, 1979.  It relied on the balancing test set forth by this Court in <em>Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html">330 U. S. 501</a></span> (1947), and its companion case, <em>Koster v. Lumbermens Mut. Cas. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html">330 U. S. 518</a></span> (1947).  In those decisions, the Court stated that a plaintiff\'s choice of forum should rarely be disturbed.  However, when an alternative forum has jurisdiction to hear the case, and when trial in the chosen forum would "establish . . . oppressiveness and vexation to a defendant . . . out of all proportion to plaintiff\'s convenience," or when the "chosen forum [is] inappropriate because of considerations affecting the court\'s own administrative and legal problems," the court may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, dismiss the case.  <em>Koster, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html#524">330 U. S. 524</a></span>.  To guide trial court discretion, the Court provided a list of "private interest factors" affecting the convenience of the litigants, and a list of "public interest factors" affecting the convenience of the forum.  <em>Gilbert, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#508">330 U. S. 508</a></span>-509. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="242">Page 454 U. S. 242</a></p><p></p>\n<p>After describing our decisions in <em>Gilbert.</em> and <em>Koster,</em> the District Court analyzed the facts of these cases.  It began by observing that an alternative forum existed in Scotland; Piper and Hartzell had agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the Scottish courts and to waive any statute of limitations defense that might be available.  It then stated that plaintiffs choice of forum was entitled to little weight.  The court recognized that a plaintiff\'s choice ordinarily deserves substantial deference.  It noted, however, that Reyno</p>\n<p>"is a representative of foreign citizens and residents seeking a forum in the United States because of the more liberal rules concerning products liability law,"</p>\n<p>and that</p>\n<p>"the courts have been less solicitous when the plaintiff is not an American citizen or resident, and particularly when the foreign citizens seek to benefit from the more liberal tort rules provided for the protection of citizens and residents of the United States."</p>\n<p>479 F.Supp. at 731.</p>\n<p>The District Court next examined several factors relating to the private interests of the litigants, and determined that these factors strongly pointed towards Scotland as the appropriate forum.  Although evidence concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the plane and propeller is located in the United States, the connections with Scotland are otherwise "overwhelming."  <em>Id.</em> at 732.  The real parties in interest are citizens of Scotland, as were all the decedents.  Witnesses who could testify regarding the maintenance of the aircraft, the training of the pilot, and the investigation of the accident -- all essential to the defense -- are in Great Britain.  Moreover, all witnesses to damages are located in Scotland.  Trial would be aided by familiarity with Scottish topography, and by easy access to the wreckage.</p>\n<p>The District Court reasoned that, because crucial witnesses and evidence were beyond the reach of compulsory process, and because the defendants would not be able to implead potential Scottish third-party defendants, it would be "unfair to make Piper and Hartzell proceed to trial in this forum."  <em>Id.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="243">Page 454 U. S. 243</a></p><p> at 733.  The survivors had brought separate actions in Scotland against the pilot, McDonald, and Air Navigation.  "[I]t would be fairer to all parties and less costly if the entire case was presented to one jury with available testimony from all relevant witnesses."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Although the court recognized that, if trial were held in the United States, Piper and Hartzell could file indemnity or contribution actions against the Scottish defendants, it believed that there was a significant risk of inconsistent verdicts. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court concluded that the relevant public interests also pointed strongly towards dismissal.  The court determined that Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper and Scottish law to Hartzell if the case were tried in the Middle District of Pennsylvania. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As a result, "trial in this forum would be hopelessly complex and confusing for a jury."  <em>Id.</em> at 734.  In addition, the court noted that it was unfamiliar with Scottish law and thus would have to rely upon experts from that country.  The court also found that the trial would be enormously costly and time-consuming; that it would be unfair to burden citizens with jury duty when the Middle District </p><p><a class="page-number" name="244">Page 454 U. S. 244</a></p><p> of Pennsylvania has little connection with the controversy; and that Scotland has a substantial interest in the outcome of the litigation.</p>\n<p>In opposing the motions to dismiss, respondent contended that dismissal would be unfair because Scottish law was less favorable.  The District Court explicitly rejected this claim.  It reasoned that the possibility that dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in the law did not deserve significant weight; any deficiency in the foreign law was a "matter to be dealt with in the foreign forum."  <em>Id.</em> at 738.</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and remanded for trial.  The decision to reverse appears to be based on two alternative grounds.  First, the Court held that the District Court abused its discretion in conducting the <em>Gilbert</em> analysis.  Second, the Court held that dismissal is never appropriate where the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals began its review of the District Court\'s <em>Gilbert</em> analysis by noting that the plaintiff\'s choice of forum deserved substantial weight, even though the real parties in interest are nonresidents.  It then rejected the District Court\'s balancing of the private interests.  It found that Piper and Hartzell had failed adequately to support their claim that key witnesses would be unavailable if trial were held in the United States:  they had never specified the witnesses they would call and the testimony these witnesses would provide.  The Court of Appeals gave little weight to the fact that Piper and Hartzell would not be able to implead potential Scottish third-party defendants, reasoning that this difficulty would be "burdensome" but not "unfair," 630 F.2d at 162. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Finally, the court stated that resolution of the suit </p><p><a class="page-number" name="245">Page 454 U. S. 245</a></p><p> would not be significantly aided by familiarity with Scottish topography, or by viewing the wreckage.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also rejected the District Court\'s analysis of the public interest factors.  It found that the District Court gave undue emphasis to the application of Scottish law:</p>\n<p>"\'the mere fact that the court is called upon to determine and apply foreign law does not present a legal problem of the sort which would justify the dismissal of a case otherwise properly before the court.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 163 (quoting <em>Hoffman v. Goberman,</em> 420 F.2d 423, 427 (CA3 1970)).  In any event, it believed that Scottish law need not be applied.  After conducting its own choice of law analysis, the Court of Appeals determined that American law would govern the actions against both Piper and Hartzell. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The same choice of law analysis apparently led it to conclude that Pennsylvania and Ohio, rather than Scotland, are the jurisdictions with the greatest policy interests in the dispute, and that all other public interest factors favored trial in the United States. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="246">Page 454 U. S. 246</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In any event, it appears that the Court of Appeals would have reversed even if the District Court had properly balanced the public and private interests.  The court stated:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is apparent that the dismissal would work a change in the applicable law so that the plaintiff\'s strict liability claim would be eliminated from the case.  But . . . a dismissal for <em>forum non conveniens,</em> like a statutory transfer, \'should not, despite its convenience, result in a change in the applicable law.\'  Only when American law is not applicable, or when the foreign jurisdiction would, as a matter of its own choice of law, give the plaintiff the benefit of the claim to which she is entitled here, would dismissal be justified."</p>\n<p>630 F.2d at 163-164 (footnote omitted) (quoting <em>DeMateos v. Texaco, Inc.,</em> 562 F.2d 895, 899 (CA3 1977), <em>cert. denied,</em> 435 U.S. 904 (1978)).

That case arose out of a collision between two vessels in American waters.  The Canadian owners of cargo lost in the accident sued the Canadian owners of one of the vessels in Federal District Court.  The cargo owners chose an American court in large part because the relevant American liability rules were more favorable than the Canadian rules.  The District Court dismissed on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em>  The plaintiffs argued that dismissal was inappropriate because Canadian laws were less favorable to them.

[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  However, <em>Gilbert</em> in no way affects the validity of <em>Canada Malting.</em>  Indeed, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="249">Page 454 U. S. 249</a></p><p> by holding that the central focus of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> inquiry is convenience, <em>Gilbert</em> implicitly recognized that dismissal may not be barred solely because of the possibility of an unfavorable change in law. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Under <em>Gilbert,</em> dismissal will ordinarily be appropriate where trial in the plaintiff\'s chosen forum imposes a heavy burden on the defendant or the court, and where the plaintiff is unable to offer any specific reasons of convenience supporting his choice. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  If substantial weight were given to the possibility of an unfavorable change in law, however, dismissal might be barred even where trial in the chosen forum was plainly inconvenient.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' decision is inconsistent with this Court\'s earlier <em>forum non conveniens</em> decisions in another respect.  Those decisions have repeatedly emphasized the need to retain flexibility.  In <em>Gilbert,</em> the Court refused to identify specific circumstances "which will justify or require either grant or denial of remedy."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#508">330 U. S. 508</a></span>.  Similarly, in <em>Koster,</em> the Court rejected the contention that, where a trial would involve inquiry into the internal affairs of a foreign corporation, dismissal was always appropriate.  "That is one, but only one, factor which may show convenience."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html#527">330 U. S. 527</a></span>.  And in <em>Williams v. Green Bay &amp; Western R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/549/case.html">326 U. S. 549</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/326/549/case.html#557">326 U. S. 557</a></span> (1946), we stated that we would not lay down a rigid rule to govern discretion, and that "[e]ach case turns on its facts."  If central emphasis were </p><p><a class="page-number" name="250">Page 454 U. S. 250</a></p><p> placed on any one factor, the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine would lose much of the very flexibility that makes it so valuable.</p>\n<p>In fact, if conclusive or substantial weight were given to the possibility of a change in law, the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine would become virtually useless.  Jurisdiction and venue requirements are often easily satisfied.  As a result, many plaintiffs are able to choose from among several forums.  Ordinarily, these plaintiffs will select that forum whose choice of law rules are most advantageous.  Thus, if the possibility of an unfavorable change in substantive law is given substantial weight in the <em>forum non conveniens</em> inquiry, dismissal would rarely be proper.</p>\n<p>Except for the court below, every Federal Court of Appeals that has considered this question after <em>Gilbert</em> has held that dismissal on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> may be granted even though the law applicable in the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff\'s chance of recovery.  <em>See, e.g., Pain v. United Technologies Corp.,</em> 205 U.S.App.D.C. 229, 248-249, 637 F.2d 775, 794-795 (1980); <em>Fitzgerald v. Texaco, Inc.,</em> 521 F.2d 448, 453 (CA2 1975), <em>cert. denied,</em> 423 U.S. 1052 (1976); <em>Anastasiadis v. S.S. Little John,</em> 346 F.2d 281, 283 (CA5 1965), <em>cert. denied,</em> 384 U.S. 920 (1966). [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Several courts have relied expressly on <em>Canada Malting</em> to hold that the possibility of an unfavorable change of law should not, by itself, bar dismissal.  <em>See Fitzgerald</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="251">Page 454 U. S. 251</a></p><p> <em>v. Texaco, Inc., supra; Anglo-American Grain Co. v. The SIT Mina D\'Amico,</em> 169 F.Supp. 908 (ED Va.1959).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals\' approach is not only inconsistent with the purpose of the <em>forum non conveniens</em> doctrine, but also poses substantial practical problems.  If the possibility of a change in law were given substantial weight, deciding motions to dismiss on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens</em> would become quite difficult.  Choice of law analysis would become extremely important, and the courts would frequently be required to interpret the law of foreign jurisdictions.  First, the trial court would have to determine what law would apply if the case were tried in the chosen forum, and what law would apply if the case were tried in the alternative forum.  It would then have to compare the rights, remedies, and procedures available under the law that would be applied in each forum.  Dismissal would be appropriate only if the court concluded that the Law applied by the alternative forum is as favorable to the plaintiff as that of the chosen forum.  The doctrine of<em>forum non conveniens,</em> however, is designed in part to help courts avoid conducting complex exercises in comparative law.  As we stated in <em>Gilbert,</em> the public interest factors point towards dismissal where the court would be required to "untangle problems in conflict of laws, and in law foreign to itself."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#509">330 U. S. 509</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Upholding the decision of the Court of Appeals would result in other practical problems.  At least where the foreign plaintiff named an American manufacturer as defendant, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] a court could not dismiss the case on grounds of <em>forum non</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="252">Page 454 U. S. 252</a></p><p> <em>conveniens</em> where dismissal might lead to an unfavorable change in law.  The American courts, which are already extremely attractive to foreign plaintiffs, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] would become even more attractive.  The flow of litigation into the United States would increase and further congest already crowded courts. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="253">Page 454 U. S. 253</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals based its decision, at least in part, on an analogy between dismissals on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> and transfers between federal courts pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1404(a).  In <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/612/case.html">376 U. S. 612</a></span> (1964), this Court ruled that a \xc2\xa7 1404(a) transfer should not result in a change in the applicable law.  Relying on dictum in an earlier Third Circuit opinion interpreting <em>Van Dusen,</em> the court below held that that principle is also applicable to a dismissal on <em>forum non conveniens</em> grounds.  630 F.2d at 164, and n. 51 (citing <em>DeMateos v. Texaco, Inc.,</em> 562 F.2d at 899).  However, \xc2\xa7 1404(a) transfers are different than dismissals on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em></p>\n<p>Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1404(a) to permit change of venue between federal courts.  Although the statute was drafted in accordance with the doctrine of<em>forum non conveniens, see</em> Revisor\'s Note, H.R.Rep. No. 308, 80th Cong., 1st Sess., A132 (1947); H.R.Rep. No. 2646, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., A127 (1946), it was intended to be a revision, rather than a codification of the common law.  <em>Norwood v. Kirkpatrick,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/29/case.html">349 U. S. 29</a></span> (1955).  District courts were given more discretion to transfer under \xc2\xa7 1404(a) than they had to dismiss on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/349/29/case.html#31">349 U. S. 31</a></span>-32.</p>\n<p>The reasoning employed in <em>Van Dusen v. Barrack</em> is simply inapplicable to dismissals on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em>  That case did not discuss the common law doctrine.  Rather, it focused on "the construction and application" of \xc2\xa7 1404(a).  376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/612/case.html#613">376 U. S. 613</a></span>. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Emphasizing the remedial </p><p><a class="page-number" name="254">Page 454 U. S. 254</a></p><p> purpose of the statute, <em>Barrack</em> concluded that Congress could not have intended a transfer to be accompanied by a change in law.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/612/case.html#622">376 U. S. 622</a></span>.  The statute was designed as a "federal housekeeping measure," allowing easy change of venue within a unified federal system.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/612/case.html#613">376 U. S. 613</a></span>.  The Court feared that, if a change in venue were accompanied by a change in law, forum-shopping parties would take unfair advantage of the relaxed standards for transfer.  The rule was necessary to ensure the just and efficient operation of the statute. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>We do not hold that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law should <em>never</em> be a relevant consideration in a <em>forum non conveniens</em> inquiry.  Of course, if the remedy provided by the alternative forum is so clearly inadequate or unsatisfactory that it is no remedy at all, the unfavorable change in law may be given substantial weight; the district court may conclude that dismissal would not be in the interests of justice. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  In these cases, however, the remedies that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="255">Page 454 U. S. 255</a></p><p> would be provided by the Scottish courts do not fall within this category.  Although the relatives of the decedents may not be able to rely on a strict liability theory, and although their potential damages award may be smaller, there is no danger that they will be deprived of any remedy or treated unfairly.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also erred in rejecting the District Court\'s <em>Gilbert</em> analysis.  The Court of Appeals stated that more weight should have been given to the plaintiff\'s choice of forum, and criticized the District Court\'s analysis of the private and public interests.  However, the District Court\'s decision regarding the deference due plaintiff\'s choice of forum was appropriate.  Furthermore, we do not believe that the District Court abused its discretion in weighing the private and public interests.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court acknowledged that there is ordinarily a strong presumption in favor of the plaintiff\'s choice of forum, which may be overcome only when the private and public interest factors clearly point towards trial in the alternative forum.  It held, however, that the presumption applies with less force when the plaintiff or real parties in interest are foreign.</p>\n<p>The District Court\'s distinction between resident or citizen plaintiffs and foreign plaintiffs is fully justified.  In <em>Koster,</em> the Court indicated that a plaintiff\'s choice of forum is entitled to greater deference when the plaintiff has chosen the home forum.  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html#524">330 U. S. 524</a></span>. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  When the home forum has </p><p><a class="page-number" name="256">Page 454 U. S. 256</a></p><p> been chosen, it is reasonable to assume that this choice is convenient.  When the plaintiff is foreign, however, this assumption is much less reasonable.  Because the central purpose of any <em>forum non conveniens</em> inquiry is to ensure that the trial is convenient, a foreign plaintiff\'s choice deserves less deference. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="257">Page 454 U. S. 257</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The <em>forum non conveniens</em> determination is committed to the sound discretion of the trial court.  It may be reversed only when there has been a clear abuse of discretion; where the court has considered all relevant public and private interest factors, and where its balancing of these factors is reasonable, its decision deserves substantial deference.  <em>Gilbert,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#511">330 U. S. 511</a></span>-512; <em>Koster,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html#531">330 U. S. 531</a></span>.  Here, the Court of Appeals expressly acknowledged that the standard of review was one of abuse of discretion.  In examining the District Court\'s analysis of the public and private interests, however, the Court of Appeals seems to have lost sight of this rule, and substituted its own judgment for that of the District Court.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>In analyzing the private interest factors, the District Court stated that the connections with Scotland are "overwhelming."  479 F.Supp. at 732.  This characterization may be somewhat exaggerated.  Particularly with respect to the question of relative ease of access to sources of proof, the private interests point in both directions.  As respondent emphasizes, records concerning the design, manufacture, and testing of the propeller and plane are located in the United States.  She would have greater access to sources of proof relevant to her strict liability and negligence theories if trial were held here. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  However, the District Court did not act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="258">Page 454 U. S. 258</a></p><p> unreasonably in concluding that fewer evidentiary problems would be posed if the trial were held in Scotland.  A large proportion of the relevant evidence is located in Great Britain.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals found that the problems of proof could not be given any weight because Piper and Hartzell failed to describe with specificity the evidence they would not be able to obtain if trial were held in the United States.  It suggested that defendants seeking <em>forum non conveniens</em> dismissal must submit affidavits identifying the witnesses they would call and the testimony these witnesses would provide if the trial were held in the alternative forum.  Such detail is not necessary. [<a href="#F26" name="T26">Footnote 26</a>]  Piper and Hartzell have moved for dismissal precisely because many crucial witnesses are located beyond the reach of compulsory process, and thus are difficult to identify or interview.  Requiring extensive investigation would defeat the purpose of their motion.  Of course, defendants must provide enough information to enable the District Court to balance the parties\' interests.  Our examination of the record convinces us that sufficient information </p><p><a class="page-number" name="259">Page 454 U. S. 259</a></p><p> was provided here.  Both Piper and Hartzell submitted affidavits describing the evidentiary problems they would face if the trial were held in the United States. [<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court correctly concluded that the problems posed by the inability to implead potential third-party defendants clearly supported holding the trial in Scotland.  Joinder of the pilot\'s estate, Air Navigation, and McDonald is crucial to the presentation of petitioners\' defense.  If Piper and Hartzell can show that the accident was caused not by a design defect, but rather by the negligence of the pilot, the plane\'s owners, or the charter company, they will be relieved of all liability.  It is true, of course, that, if Hartzell and Piper were found liable after a trial in the United States, they could institute an action for indemnity or contribution against these parties in Scotland.  It would be far more convenient, however, to resolve all claims in one trial.  The Court of Appeals rejected this argument.  Forcing petitioners to rely on actions for indemnity or contributions would be "burdensome," but not "unfair."  630 F.2d at 162.  Finding that trial in the plaintiff\'s chosen forum would be burdensome, however, is sufficient to support dismissal on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens.</em> [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court\'s review of the factors relating to the public interest was also reasonable.  On the basis of its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="260">Page 454 U. S. 260</a></p><p> choice of law analysis, it concluded that, if the case were tried in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Pennsylvania law would apply to Piper and Scottish law to Hartzell.  It stated that a trial involving two sets of laws would be confusing to the jury.  It also noted its own lack of familiarity with Scottish law.  Consideration of these problems was clearly appropriate under <em>Gilbert;</em> in that case, we explicitly held that the need to apply foreign law pointed towards dismissal. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals found that the District Court\'s choice of law analysis was incorrect, and that American law would apply to both Hartzell and Piper.  Thus, lack of familiarity with foreign law would not be a problem.  Even if the Court of Appeals\' conclusion is correct, however, all other public interest factors favored trial in Scotland.</p>\n<p>Scotland has a very strong interest in this litigation.  The accident occurred in its airspace.  All of the decedents were Scottish.  Apart from Piper and Hartzell, all potential plaintiffs and defendants are either Scottish or English.  As we stated in <em>Gilbert,</em> there is "a local interest in having localized controversies decided at home."  330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#509">330 U. S. 509</a></span>.  Respondent argues that American citizens have an interest in ensuring that American manufacturers are deterred from producing defective products, and that additional deterrence might be obtained if Piper and Hartzell were tried in the United States, where they could be sued on the basis of both negligence and strict liability.  However, the incremental deterrence that would be gained if this trial were held in an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="261">Page 454 U. S. 261</a></p><p> American court is likely to be insignificant.  The American interest in this accident is simply not sufficient to justify the enormous commitment of judicial time and resources that would inevitably be required if the case were to be tried here.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the possibility of an unfavorable change in law bars dismissal on the ground of <em>forum non conveniens.</em>  It also erred in rejecting the District Court\'s <em>Gilbert</em> analysis.  The District Court properly decided that the presumption in favor of the respondent\'s forum choice applied with less than maximum force because the real parties in interest are foreign.  It did not act unreasonably in deciding that the private interests pointed towards trial in Scotland.  Nor did it act unreasonably in deciding that the public interests favored trial in Scotland.  Thus, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed.</em></p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL took no part in the decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE O\'CONNOR took no part in the consideration or decision of these cases.</p>\n<p>* Together with No. 80-883, <em>Hartzell Propeller, Inc. v.

It originated in Scotland, <em>see</em> Braucher, The Inconvenient Federal Forum, 60 Harv.L.Rev. 908, 909-911 (1947), and became part of the common law of many States, <em>see id.</em> at 911-912; Blair, The Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens in Anglo-American Law, 29 Colum.L.Rev. 1 (1929).  The doctrine was also frequently applied in federal admiralty actions.  <em>See, e.g., Canada Malting Co. v. Paterson Steamships, Ltd.; see also</em> Bickel, The Doctrine of Forum Non Conveniens As Applied in the Federal Courts in Matters of Admiralty, 35 Cornell L.Q. 12 (1949).  In <em>Williams v.

The doctrine became firmly established when <em>Gilbert</em> and <em>Koster</em> were decided one year later.</p>\n<p>In previous <em>forum non conveniens</em> decisions, the Court has left unresolved the question whether, under <em>Erie R.

The Court did not decide this issue, because the same result would have been reached in each case under federal or state law.  The lower courts in these cases reached the same conclusion:  Pennsylvania and California law on <em>forum non conveniens</em> dismissals are virtually identical to federal law.  <em>See</em> 630 F.2d at 158.  Thus, here also, we need not resolve the <em>Erie</em> question.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p><em>See also Williams v. Green Bay &amp; Western R.

This is precisely the situation in which the Court of Appeals\' rule would bar dismissal.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T16" name="F16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Cf. Dahl v.

A foreign plaintiff seeking damages for an accident that occurred abroad might be able to obtain service of process on a foreign defendant who does business in the United States. Under the Court of Appeals\' holding, dismissal would be barred if the law in the alternative forum were less favorable to the plaintiff -- even though none of the parties are American, and even though there is absolutely no nexus between the subject matter of the litigation and the United States.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>First, all but 6 of the 50 American States -- Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia, and Wyoming -- offer strict liability.  1 CCH Prod.Liability Rep. \xc2\xa7 4016 (1981).  Rules roughly equivalent to American strict liability are effective in France, Belgium, and Luxembourg.  West Germany and Japan have a strict liability statute for pharmaceuticals.  However, strict liability remains primarily an American innovation.  Second, the tort plaintiff may choose, at least potentially, from among 50 jurisdictions if he decides to file suit in the United States.  Each of these jurisdictions applies its own set of malleable choice of law rules.  Third, jury trials are almost always available in the United States, while they are never provided in civil law jurisdictions.  G. Gloss, Comparative Law 12 (1979); J. Merryman, The Civil Law Tradition 121 (1969).  Even in the United Kingdom, most civil actions are not tried before a jury.  1 G. Keeton, The United Kingdom:  The Development of its Laws and Constitutions 309 (1955).  Fourth, unlike most foreign jurisdictions, American courts allow contingent attorney\'s fees, and do not tax losing parties with their opponents\' attorney\'s fees.  R. Schlesinger, Comparative Law:  Cases, Text, Materials 275-277 (3d ed.1970); Orban, Product Liability:  A Comparative Legal Restatement -- Foreign National Law and the EEC Directive, 8 Ga.J.Int\'l &amp; Comp.L. 342, 393 (1978).  Fifth, discovery is more extensive in American than in foreign courts.  R. Schlesinger, <em>supra,</em> at 307, 310, and n. 33.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T19" name="F19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>In holding that the possibility of a change in law unfavorable to the plaintiff should not be given substantial weight, we also necessarily hold that the possibility of a change in law favorable to defendant should not be considered.  Respondent suggests that Piper and Hartzell filed the motion to dismiss not simply because trial in the United States would be inconvenient, but also because they believe the laws of Scotland are more favorable.  She argues that this should be taken into account in the analysis of the private interests.  We recognize, of course, that Piper and Hartzell may be engaged in reverse forum-shopping.  However, this possibility ordinarily should not enter into a trial court\'s analysis of the private interests.  If the defendant is able to overcome the presumption in favor of plaintiff by showing that trial in the chosen forum would be unnecessarily burdensome, dismissal is appropriate -- regardless of the fact that defendant may also be motivated by a desire to obtain a more favorable forum.  <em>Cf. Kloeckner Reederei und Kohlenhandel v. A/S Hakedal,</em> 210 F.2d 754, 757 (CA2) (defendant not entitled to dismissal on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> solely because the law of the original forum is less favorable to him than the law of the alternative forum), <em>cert. dism\'d by stipulation,</em> 348 U.S. 801 (1954).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T20" name="F20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Barrack</em> at least implicitly recognized that the rule it announced for transfer under \xc2\xa7 1404(a) was not the common law rule.  It cited several decisions under \xc2\xa7 1404(a) in which lower courts had been "strongly inclined to protect plaintiffs against the risk that transfer might be accompanied by a prejudicial change in applicable state laws."  376 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/376/612/case.html#630">376 U. S. 630</a></span>, n. 26.  These decisions frequently rested on the assumption that a change in law would have been unavoidable under common law <em>forum non conveniens,</em> but could be avoided under \xc2\xa7 1404(a).  <em>See, e.g., Greve v. Gibraltar Enterprises, Inc.,</em> 85 F.Supp. 410, 414 (NM 1949).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T21" name="F21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit has expressly rejected the contention that rules governing transfers pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1404(a) also govern <em>forum non conveniens</em> dismissals.  <em>Schertenleib v.

Ordinarily, this requirement will be satisfied when the defendant is "amenable to process" in the other jurisdiction.  <em>Gilbert,</em> 330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/501/case.html#506">330 U.

In rare circumstances, however, where the remedy offered by the other forum is clearly unsatisfactory, the other forum may not be an adequate alternative, and the initial requirement may not be satisfied.  Thus, for example, dismissal would not be appropriate where the alternative forum does not permit litigation of the subject matter of the dispute.  <em>Cf. Phoenix Canada Oil Co., Ltd. v. Texaco, Inc.,</em> 78 F.R.D. 445 (Del.1978) (court refuses to dismiss, where alternative forum is Ecuador, it is unclear whether Ecuadorean tribunal will hear the case, and there is no generally codified Ecuadorean legal remedy for the unjust enrichment and tort claims asserted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T23" name="F23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Koster,</em> we stated that,</p>\n<p>"[i]n any balancing of conveniences, a real showing of convenience by a plaintiff who has sued in his home forum will normally outweigh the inconvenience the defendant may have shown."</p>\n<p>330 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/518/case.html#524">330 U.

Baychem Corp.,</em> 556 F.2d 975 (CA9 1977), <em>cert. denied,</em> 434 U.S. 1035 (1978).  Citizens or residents deserve somewhat more deference than foreign plaintiffs, but dismissal should not be automatically barred when a plaintiff has filed suit in his home forum.

And in a decision handed down two weeks after the decision in this case, another Third Circuit panel affirmed a dismissal without mentioning such a requirement.  <em>See Dahl v. United Technologies Corp.,</em> 632 F.2d 1027 (1980).</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals apparently relied on an analogy to motions to transfer under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1404(a).  630 F.2d at 160-161.

S. 262</a></p><p> <em>forum non conveniens</em> merely by showing that the substantive law that would be applied if the case were litigated in the district court is more favorable to them than the law that would be applied by the courts of their own nation."</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. in No. 80-848, p. i.  In No. 8083, the Court limited its grant of certiorari, <em>see</em> 450 U.S. 909, to the same question:</p>\n<p>"Must a motion to dismiss on grounds of <em>forum non conveniens</em> be denied whenever the law of the alternate forum is less favorable to recovery than that which would be applied by the district court?"</p>\n<p>Pet. for Cert. in No. 80-883, p. i.  I agree that this question should be answered in the negative.  Having decided that question, I would simply remand the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration of the question whether the District Court correctly decided that Pennsylvania was not a convenient forum in which to litigate a claim against a Pennsylvania company that a plane was defectively designed and manufactured in Pennsylvania.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
