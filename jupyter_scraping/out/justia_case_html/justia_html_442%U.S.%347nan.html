JUSTICE BRENNAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The question for decision is whether \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), 83 Stat. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="349">Page 442 U. S. 349</a></p><p> 853, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4332(2)(C), requires federal agencies to prepare environmental impact statements (EIS\'s) to accompany appropriation requests.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>NEPA sets forth its purposes in bold strokes:</p>\n<p>"The purposes of this Act are:  To declare a national policy which will encourage productive and enjoyable harmony between man and his environment; to promote efforts which will prevent or eliminate damage to the environment and biosphere and stimulate the health and welfare of man; to enrich the understanding of the ecological systems and natural resources important to the Nation. . . ."</p>\n<p>83 Stat. 852, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4321. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Congress recognized, however, that these desired goals could </p><p><a class="page-number" name="350">Page 442 U. S. 350</a></p><p> be incorporated into the everyday functioning of the Federal Government only with great difficulty.  <em>See</em> S.Rep. No. 91-296, p. 19 (1969).  NEPA therefore contains "action-forcing procedures which will help to insure that the policies [of the Act] are implemented."  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>See Kleppe v. Sierra Club,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/390/case.html">427 U. S. 390</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/390/case.html#409">427 U. S. 409</a></span> (1976).  Section 102(2)(C) of the Act sets out one of these procedures:</p>\n<p>"The Congress authorizes and directs that, to the fullest extent possible . . . (2) all agencies of the Federal Government shall --"</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"(C) include in every recommendation or report <em>on proposals for legislation and other major Federal actions</em> significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, a detailed statement by the responsible official on -- "</p>\n<p>"(i) the environmental impact of the proposed action,"</p>\n<p>"(ii) any adverse environmental effects which cannot be avoided should the proposal be implemented,"</p>\n<p>"(iii) alternatives to the proposed action,"</p>\n<p>"(iv) the relationship between local short-term uses of man\'s environment and the maintenance and enhancement of long-term productivity, and"</p>\n<p>"(v) any irreversible and irretrievable commitments of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should it be implemented."</p>\n<p>83 Stat. 853, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4332(2)(C) (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>The thrust of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) is thus that environmental concerns be integrated into the very process of agency decisionmaking.  The "detailed statement" it requires is the outward sign that environmental values and consequences have been considered during the planning stage of agency actions. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  If </p><p><a class="page-number" name="351">Page 442 U. S. 351</a></p><p> environmental concerns are not interwoven into the fabric of agency planning, the "action-forcing" characteristics of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) would be lost.</p>\n<p>"In the past, environmental factors have frequently been ignored and omitted from consideration in the early stages of planning. . . .  As a result, unless the results of planning are radically revised at the policy level -- and this often means the Congress -- environmental enhancement opportunities may be foregone, and unnecessary degradation incurred."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No 91-296, <em>supra,</em> at 20.  For this reason, the regulations of the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) require federal agencies to "integrate the NEPA process with other planning at the earliest possible time to insure that planning and decisions reflect environmental values. . . ."  43 Fed.Reg. 55992 (1978) (to be codified at 40 CFR \xc2\xa7 1501.2).

Respondents named as defendants the Secretary of the Interior and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and alleged that proposed curtailments in the budget of the National Wildlife Refuge System (NWRS), 80 Stat. 927, 16 U.S.C. 668dd, would "cut back significantly the operations, maintenance, and staffing of units within the System." [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Complaint \xef\xbf\xbd  17.  The System is administered by the Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior, and consists of more than 350 refuges encompassing more than 30 million acres in 49 States.  The primary purpose of the NWRS is to provide a national program</p>\n<p>"for the restoration preservation, development and management of wildlife and wildlands habitat; for the protection and preservation of endangered or threatened species and their habitat; and for the management of wildlife and wildlands to obtain the maximum benefits from these resources."</p>\n<p>50 CFR  25.11(b) </p><p><a class="page-number" name="353">Page 442 U.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court agreed with respondents\' contentions.  Relying on provisions of the then-applicable CEQ guidelines, [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="354">Page 442 U. S. 354</a></p><p> and on the Department of the Interior\'s Manual, [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] the District Court held that "appropriation requests are <em>proposals for legislation\' within the meaning of NEPA," and also that "annual proposals for financing the Refuge System are major Federal actions which clearly have a significant effect on the environment."  <em>Sierra Club v. Morton,</em> 395 F.Supp. 1187, 1188, 1189 (1975).  The District Court granted respondents\' motion for summary judgment, and provided declaratory and injunctive relief.  It stated that the Department of the Interior and OMB were required "to prepare, consider, and disseminate environmental impact statements on annual proposals for financing the National Wildlife Refuge System."  12 App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a.\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit modified the holding of the District Court.  The Court of Appeals was apprehensive because "[a] rule requiring preparation of an EIS on the annual budget request for virtually every ongoing program would trivialize NEPA." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  189 U.S.App.D.C. 117, 125, 581 F.2d 895, 903 (1978).  Therefore, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) required </p><p><a class="page-number" name="355">Page 442 U. S. 355</a></p><p> the preparation of an EIS only when an appropriation request accompanies "a <em>proposal\' for taking new action which significantly changes the <em>status quo,</em>" or when "the request for budget approval and appropriations is one that ushers in a considered programmatic course following a programmatic review."  189 U.S.App.D.C. at 125, 581 F.2d at 903.  Section 102(2)(C) would thus have no application to "a routine request for budget approval and appropriations for continuance and management of an ongoing program."  189 U.S.App.D.C. at 125, 581 F.2d at 903.  The Court of Appeals held, however, that there was no need for injunctive relief, because the Fish and Wildlife Service had completed during the pendency of the appeal a "Programmatic EIS" that adequately evaluated the environmental consequences for the NWRS of various budgetary alternatives. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  <em>Id.</em> at 126, 581 F.2d at 904.  <em>See</em> United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Final Environmental Statement:  Operation of the National Wildlife Refuge System (Nov.1976).

Petitioners argue, however, that the requirements of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) have no application to the budget process.  The contrary holding of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="356">Page 442 U. S. 356</a></p><p> Court of Appeals rests on two alternative interpretations of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C).  The first is that appropriation requests which are the result of "an agency\'s painstaking review of an ongoing program," 189 U.S.App.D.C. at 125, 581 F.2d at 903, are "proposals for legislation" within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C).  The second is that appropriation requests which are the reflection of "new" agency initiatives constituting "major Federal actions" under NEPA, are themselves "proposals for . . . major Federal actions" for purposes of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C).  We hold that neither interpretation is correct.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We note initially that NEPA makes no distinction between "proposals for legislation" that are the result of "painstaking review" and those that are merely "routine."  When Congress has thus spoken "in the plainest of words," <em>TVA v. Hill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html">437 U. S. 153</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html#194">437 U. S. 194</a></span> (1978), we will ordinarily decline to fracture the clear language of a statute, even for the purpose of fashioning from the resulting fragments a rule that "accords with <em>common sense and the public weal.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/437/153/case.html#195">437 U. S. 195</a></span>.  Therefore, either all appropriation requests constitute "proposals for legislation" or none does.\n</em></p>\n<p>There is no direct evidence in the legislative history of NEPA that enlightens whether Congress intended the phrase "proposals for legislation" to include requests for appropriations.  At the time of the Court of Appeals\' decision, however, CEQ guidelines provided that \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C) applied to "[r]ecommendations or favorable reports relating to legislation including requests for appropriations."  40 CFR \xc2\xa7 1500.5(a)(1) (1977). [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  At that time CEQ\'s guidelines were advisory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="357">Page 442 U. S. 357</a></p><p> in nature, and were for the purpose of assisting federal agencies in complying with NEPA.  \xc2\xa7 1500.1(a).</p>\n<p>In 1977, however, President Carter, in order to create a single set of uniform, mandatory regulations, ordered CEQ, "after consultation with affected agencies," to "[i]ssue regulations to Federal agencies for the implementation of the procedural provisions" of NEPA.  Exec.Order No. 11991, 3 CFR 124 (1978).  The President ordered the heads of federal agencies to "comply with the regulations issued by the Council. . . ."  <em>Ibid.</em>  CEQ has since issued these regulations, 43 Fed.Reg. 55978-56007 (1978), [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] and they reverse CEQ\'s prior interpretation of \xc2\xa7 102(2)(C).  The regulations provide specifically that "<em>[l]egislation\' includes a bill or legislative proposal to Congress . . . but does <em>not</em> include requests for appropriations."  43 Fed.Reg. 56004 (1978) (to be codified at 40 CFR \xc2\xa7 1508.17).  (Emphasis supplied.)  CEQ explained this reversal by noting that, on the basis of\n</em></p>\n<p>"traditional concepts relating to appropriations and the budget cycle, considerations of timing and confidentiality, and other factors, . . . the Council in its experience found that preparation of EISs is ill-suited to the budget preparation process. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]"</p>\n<p>43 Fed.Reg. at 55989. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="358">Page 442 U. S. 358</a></p><p></p>\n<p>CEQ\'s interpretation of NEPA is entitled to substantial deference.  <em>See Warm Springs Dam Task Force v. Gribble,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/1301/case.html">417 U. S. 1301</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/1301/case.html#1309">417 U. S. 1309</a></span>-1310 (1974) (Douglas, J., in chambers).  The Council was created by NEPA, and charged in that statute with the responsibility</p>\n<p>"to review and appraise the various programs and activities of the Federal Government in the light of the policy set forth in . . . this Act . . . and to make recommendations to the President with respect thereto."</p>\n<p>83 Stat. 855, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4344(3).</p>\n<p>It is true that, in the past, we have been somewhat less inclined to defer to "administrative guidelines" when they have "conflicted with earlier pronouncements of the agency."  <em>General Electric Co. v. Gilbert,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/case.html">429 U. S. 125</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/125/case.html#143">429 U. S. 143</a></span> (1976).  But CEQ\'s reversal of interpretation occurred during the detailed and comprehensive process, ordered by the President, of transforming advisory guidelines into mandatory regulations applicable to all federal agencies.  <em>See American Trucking Assns. v. Atchison, T. ,&amp; S. F. R. Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/397/case.html">387 U.

A mandatory requirement that every federal agency submit EIS\'s with its appropriation requests raises wholly different and more serious issues "of fair and prudent administration," <em>ibid.,</em> than does nonbinding advice.  This is particularly true in light of the Court of Appeals\' correct observation that "[a] rule requiring preparation of an EIS on the annual budget request for virtually every ongoing program would trivialize NEPA."  189 U.S.App.D.C. at 125, 581 F.2d at 903.  The Court of Appeals accurately noted that such an interpretation of NEPA would be a</p>\n<p>"<em>reductio ad absurdum.</em> . . .  It would be absurd to require an EIS on every decision on the management of federal land, such as fluctuation in the number of forest fire spotters."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 124, 581 F.2d at 902.  Even respondents do not now contend that NEPA should be construed so </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 442 U.

House and Senate rules thus require a "previous choice of policy . . . before any item of appropriations might be included in a general appropriations bill."  <em>United States ex rel. Chapman v.

[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  But this interpretation distorts the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 442 U. S. 362</a></p><p> language of the Act, since appropriation requests do not "propose" federal actions at all; they instead fund actions already proposed.  Section 102(2)(C) is thus best interpreted as applying to those recommendations or reports that actually propose programmatic actions, rather than to those which merely suggest how such actions may be funded.  Any other result would create unnecessary redundancy.  For example, if the mere funding of otherwise unaltered agency programs were construed to constitute major federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the resulting EIS\'s would merely recapitulate the EIS\'s that should have accompanied the initial proposals of the programs.  And if an agency program were to be expanded or revised in a manner that constituted major federal action </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 442 U. S. 363</a></p><p> significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] an EIS would have been required to accompany the underlying programmatic decision. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  An additional EIS at the appropriation stage would add nothing.</p>\n<p>Even if changes in agency programs occur because of budgetary decisions, an EIS at the appropriation stage would only be repetitive.  For example, respondents allege in their complaint that OMB required the Fish and Wildlife Service to decrease its appropriation request for the NWRS, and that this decrease would alter the operation of the NWRS in a manner that would significantly affect the quality of the human environment.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F9" name="T9">n</a> 9, <em>supra.</em>  But since the Fish and Wildlife Service could respond to OMB\'s budgetary curtailments in a variety of ways, <em>see</em> United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Final Environmental Statement:  Operation of the National Wildlife Refuge System (Nov. 1976), it is impossible to predict whether or how any particular budget cut will, in fact, significantly affect the quality of the human environment.  OMB\'s determination to cut the Service\'s budget is not a programmatic proposal, and therefore requiring OMB to include an EIS in its budgetary cuts would be premature.  <em>See Aberdeen &amp; Rockfish R. Co. v. SCRAP,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/422/289/case.html">422 U.

And since an EIS must be prepared if any of the revisions the Fish and Wildlife Service proposes in its ongoing programs in response to OMB\'s budget cuts would significantly affect the quality of the human environment, requiring the Fish and Wildlife Service to include all EIS with its revised appropriation request would merely be redundant.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 442 U.

But an appropriation request applies not only to major changes in a federal program, but also to the entire program it is designed to fund.  Without appropriations, the underlying program would cease to exist.  Therefore, if the existence <em>vel non</em> of that program is a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the Court of Appeals\' alternative interpretation of NEPA would require an EIS to be included in the concomitant appropriation request.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T24" name="F24">Footnote 24</a>]</p>\n<p>It is important to note that CEQ regulations provide that the adjective "major" in the phrase "major Federal actions" "reinforces but does not have a meaning independent of [the adverb] significantly" in the phrase "significantly affecting the quality of the human environment."  43 Fed.Reg. 56004 (1978) (to be codified at 40 CFR \xc2\xa7 1508.18).  <em>See</em> <a href="#F20" name="T20">n</a> 20, <em>supra.</em>  As a consequence, the Court of Appeals\' holding that certain appropriation requests are "proposals for . . . major Federal actions" is operationally identical to its holding that certain appropriation requests constitute "proposals for legislation."  Both holdings would require EIS\'s to accompany funding requests for every federal program that significantly affects the quality of the human environment.  Thus, not only do both holdings run the same dangers of "trivializing" NEPA, but also the same "traditional concepts relating to appropriations and the budget cycle, considerations of timing and confidentiality," 43 Fed.Reg. 55989 (1978), which led CEQ to distinguish "appropriations" from "legislation," would require appropriations to be distinguished from "proposals for . . . major Federal actions."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
