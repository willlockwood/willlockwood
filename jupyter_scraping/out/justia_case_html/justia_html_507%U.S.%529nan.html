Specifically, a State must reimburse the Government for all such losses above a "tolerance level" set by regulation.1</p><p>Texas, through its Department of Human Services, contractually bound itself to comply with all federal regulations governing the program.

Because those losses exceeded the applicable tolerance level, Texas was bound to reimburse the Federal Government for the excess losses. The FNS notified Texas of its debt in the amount of $412,385, and informed it that prejudgment interest would begin to accrue on the balance unless payment was made within 30 days.</p><p>Texas sought administrative relief in the form of a waiver of liability. After the Food Stamp Appeals Board denied the requested relief, Texas sued the United States in the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas. In addition to challenging the Appeals Board\'s refusal to grant a waiver of liability, Texas argued that the Debt Collection Act precluded the imposition of prejudgment interest on any amount it owed the Federal Government. The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the United States on both issues. With respect to the prejudgment interest issue, the District Court adopted the approach taken by the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in <i>Gallegos </i>v. <i>Lyng, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/891/788/">891 F.2d 788</a> (1989), which held that the Government\'s common-law right to prejudgment interest on debts owed to it by the States survived enactment of the Debt Collection Act.

Relying on the language of the Debt Collection Act, the court held that the "Act is not silent concerning whether or not state obligations should be subject to prejudgment interest. The Act specifically excludes states from the payment of interest." <i>Id., </i>at 651. Because Congress did not impose interest through the specific provisions of the Food Stamp Act "during the time period relevant in this case, the Courts are not free to \'supplement\' Congress\' enactment." <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Mobil Oil Corp. </i>v. <i>Higginbotham, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/436/618/case.html">436 U.

In the court\'s view, the Federal Government could enforce its claims for unpaid mail issuance losses through the offset procedures built into the Food Stamp Act. Because of a split among the Courts of Appeals on this question, we granted certiorari, 506 U.

In such cases, Congress does not write upon a clean slate. <i>Astoria, supra, </i>at 108. In order to abrogate a common-law principle, the statute must "speak directly" to the question addressed by the common law. <i>Mobil Oil Corp. </i>v. <i>Higginbotham, supra, </i>at 625; <i>Milwaukee</i></p><p>Texas argues that this presumption favoring retention of existing law is appropriate only with respect to state common law or federal maritime law. Although a different standard applies when analyzing the effect of federallegislation on state law, id., at 316-317, there is no support in our cases for the proposition that the presumption has no application to federal common law, or for a distinction between general federal common law and federal maritime law in this regard. We agree with Texas that Congress need not "affirmatively proscribe" the common-law doctrine at issue. Brief for Respondents 3-4; see <i>Milwaukee, supra, </i>at 315. But as we stated in <i>Astoria, supra, </i>"courts may take it as a given that Congress has legislated with an expectation that the [common law] principle will apply except \'when a statutory purpose to the contrary is evident.\'\'\' 501 U. S., at 108 (quoting <i>Isbrandtsen, supra, </i>at 783).</p><p>The Debt Collection Act does not speak directly to the Federal Government\'s right to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed to it by the States. The Act states that "[t]he head of an executive or legislative agency shall charge a minimum annual rate of interest on an outstanding debt on a</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="535">535</a></p><p>United States Government claim owed by a <i>person. " </i>31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3717(a)(1) (emphasis added). Section 3701, in turn, provides that the term "\'person\' does not include an agency of the United States Government, of a State government, or of a unit of general local government." \xc2\xa7 3701(c). Texas argues that this exemption clearly establishes Congress\' intent to relieve the States of their common-law obligation to pay prejudgment interest. We disagree.</p><p>The only obligation from which \xc2\xa7 3701 exempts the States is the obligation to pay prejudgment interest in accordance with the mandatory provisions of the Act. These impose a stringent minimum interest requirement upon private persons owing money to the Federal Government. The statute is silent as to the obligation of the States to pay prejudgment interest on such debts. We agree with the Solicitor General that "Congress\'s mere refusal to legislate with respect to the prejudgment-interest obligations of state and local governments falls far short of an expression of legislative intent to supplant the existing common law in that area." Brief for Petitioners 16.4</p><p>4 Both Texas and the Court of Appeals rely on Congress\' authority to impose interest obligations on the States through specific statutes, such as the Medicaid Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1396b(d)(5), and the Social Security Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 418(j) (1982 ed.), to support the proposition that the Debt Collection Act extinguished the Federal Government\'s common-law right to collect prejudgment interest. Both statutes, however, codified and made mandatory the common-law right to collect prejudgment interest at a specified interest rate. Like the Debt Collection Act, these statutes changed the common law. Congress\' obvious desire to enhance the common law in specific, well-defined situations does not signal its desire to extinguish the common law in other situations.</p><p>Texas also relies on the recent amendment to 7 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2022 adding a provision requiring prejudgment interest on specific obligations arising under the Food Stamp Act of 1977. Pub. L. 100-435, \xc2\xa7 602, 102 Stat. 1674 (1988). But "subsequent legislative history is a \'hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier\' Congress." <i>Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation </i>v. <i>LTV Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/633/case.html">496 U. S. 633</a>, 650 (1990) (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Price, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/361/304/case.html">361 U. S. 304</a>, 313 (1960)). Texas\' argument also fails because, like</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="536">536</a></p><p>Our conclusion that the States remain subject to commonlaw prejudgment interest liability is supported by the fact that the Debt Collection Act is more onerous than the common law. Section 3717(a) <i>requires </i>federal agencies to collect prejudgment interest against persons and specifies the interest rate.5 The duty to pay prejudgment interest under the common law, however, is by no means automatic. Before imposing prejudgment interest, the courts must weigh the competing federal and state interests. <i>West Virginia, </i>479 U. S., at 309-311; <i>Board of Comm\'rs, </i>308 U. S., at 350. And instead of imposing a preestablished rate of interest, the district courts retain discretion to choose the appropriate rate in a given case. Unlike the common law, \xc2\xa7 3717 also imposes processing fees and penalty charges, 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3717(e)(1), (e)(2). Given these differences, it is logical to conclude that the Act was intended to reach only one subset of potential debtors-persons-and to leave the other subset alone. It is reasonable to apply more stringent requirements to debts owed by private persons and to keep the more flexible common law in place for debts owed by state and local governments.</p><p>The evident purpose of the Debt Collection Act reinforces our reading of the plain language. The Act was designed "[t]o increase the efficiency of Government-wide efforts to collect debts owed the United States and to provide additional procedures for the collection of debts owed the United States." 96 Stat. 1749; S. Rep. No. 97-378, p. 2 (1982) (the Act responded to "increasing concern ... expressed in Con-</p><p>the Medicaid Act and the Social Security Act provisions, the Food Stamp Act of 1977 did not merely codify the common law without change. Rather, it contains a mandatory provision requiring prejudgment interest at a specified rate.</p><p>5 The interest rate required under \xc2\xa7 3717 is "the average investment rate for the Treasury tax and loan accounts for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of each year, rounded to the nearest whole percentage point." 31 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3717(a)(1).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="537">537</a></p><p>gress and elsewhere over the increasing backlog of unpaid debts owed the federal government"). This suggests that Congress passed the Act in order to strengthen the Government\'s hand in collecting its debts. Yet under the reading proposed by Texas and the Court of Appeals, the Act would have the anomalous effect of placing delinquent States in a position where they had less incentive to pay their debts to the Federal Government than they had prior to its passage.</p><p>The Court of Appeals reasoned that the States would not have an incentive to delay payment of their debts because the Food Stamp Act makes state agencies liable for actual losses caused by coupon shortages or unauthorized issuances, and permits the Federal Government to recover these debts through an administrative offset procedure. 951 F. 2d, at 650. But the Debt Collection Act applies to all federal agencies, not just the FNS. Thus, the existence of a mechanism in the Food Stamp Act allowing the FNS to collect its debts does nothing to encourage prompt payment of debts governmentwide. That the FNS may have already possessed adequate sanctions to compel payment is not a reason to conclude that the generic language in the Debt Collection Act was meant to abrogate the existing common-law obligation of the States generally.</p><p>Texas concedes that Congress intended to enhance the Government\'s debt collection efforts by passing the Act. It argues, however, that Congress was concerned primarily with debts owed by private persons. Accordingly, runs the argument, Congress meant to relieve the States of their duty to pay interest because the States were not the root of the debt collection problem.</p><p>Part of this argument persuades; Congress in the Act tightened the screws, so to speak, on the prejudgment interest obligations of private debtors to the Government, and not on the States. It may be inferred from this fact that the former were the root of the Government\'s debt collection problems which inspired the Act. But it does not at all fol-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="538">538</a></p><p>low that because Congress did not tighten the screws on the States, it therefore intended that the screws be entirely removed. The more logical conclusion is that it left the screws in place, untightened.</p><p>As a last-ditch argument, Texas contends that its liability for losses in the mail is not a contractual debt for which it owes prejudgment interest, but rather a penalty unilaterally imposed by Congress. See <i>Rodgers </i>v. <i>United States, 332 </i>U. S. 371, 374-376 (1947) (penalties are not normally subject to prejudgment interest). This argument fails because the obligation of Texas to reimburse the Government for a portion of the stamps lost in the mail is quite different from that involved in <i>Rodgers. </i>There the penalties in question were unilaterally imposed by the Agricultural Adjustment Act on farmers who exceeded their production quotas; there was no suggestion that the farmers ever consented to such penalties. Here, on the other hand, Texas signed a Federal/State Agreement, the express terms of which bound the State to act in accordance with the implementing regulations. 7 CFR \xc2\xa7 272.2(a)(2) (1986); see also n. 2, <i>supra. </i>Thus, 7 CFR \xc2\xa7 274.3(c)(4) (1986), which imposed liability for mail issuance losses above a specified tolerance level, was incorporated into Texas\' Federal/State Agreement. The requirement that the States reimburse the Federal Government for a certain portion of mail issuance losses is not a penalty, but a contractual obligation which the State assumed.6</p><p>6 Both Texas and the Court of Appeals rely upon our decision in <i>Pennhurst State School and Hospital </i>v. <i>Halderman, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/1/case.html">451 U.

The ancient common-law presumption and a continuing recognition of "the importance of ensuring that the State\'s dignitary interests can be fully vindicated," <i>ibid., </i>best explain why Congress deliberately omitted any provision for the collection of interest from a sovereign State when it enacted the Debt Collection Act in 1982.6</p><p>The Court is also correct in noting that we are reluctant to infer a legislative abrogation of the common law. <i>Ante, </i>at 534.

Before we can apply this reluctance to infer legislative abrogations of the common law, however, we must determine what that terrain was-or at least how it might have been perceived-when Congress acted; Congress cannot think it necessary, and we should not expect it, to state clearly an intent to abrogate a common-law rule that does not exist.</p><p>When Congress enacted the Debt Collection Act of 1982, the question whether interest might ever be collected from a sovereign State unless explicitly authorized was undecided by this Court. We had never held that the United States could demand prejudgment interest on a debt owed to it by a State.

S. 305</a> (1987), did we hold for the first time that in some circumstances the United States may demand prejudgment interest from the States themselves. The Court therefore rewrites the history of our common law when it predicates its entire analysis of this case on what it creatively describes as "the United States\' federal commonlaw right to collect prejudgment interest on debts owed to it by the States." <i>Ante, </i>at 530.

Several interest groups, however, presented the view that sections 10 and 11 of the Act, except in cases where fraud was evident, should not be applied to states or local governments because they constituted a different class of debtor than did private individuals and would suffer great harm if the federal government attempted to assess interest or apply administrative offsets against them.

While noting that "interest in inter-governmental litigation has no ... roots in history," id., at 351, the Court did not rule out the possibility that in an unusual case, considerations of fairness might make it appropriate to collect such interest from a state agency, see id., at 352.

This amendment, UP amendment 1299, amended provisions in Sections 10 and 11 of the Act, stating that \'the term "person" does not include any agency of the United States, or any state or local government.\' This provision effectively took federal agencies, states and local governments out of the Act, but retained sufficient flexibility to permit Congress to legislatively pick and choose according to circumstances, those situations in which the government might assess interest against those entities exempted by the Act. As enacted, the Debt Collection Act of 1982 appears clear on this point. It was not anticipated that federal agencies would attempt to invoke common law authority, which, <i>if it exists with respect to interest assessment and administrative offset against states and local governments, </i>was abrogated by sections 10(e)(2) and 11(e)(8) of the Act."

The Court held that "any rule exempting a sovereign from the payment of prejudgment interest not only does not apply of its own force to the State\'s obligations to the Federal Government, cf. <i>Library of Congress </i>v. <i>Shaw, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/310/case.html">478 U.

This was the first statement by this Court suggesting that the States might be generally liable for prejudgment interest on the contractual claims brought by the Federal Government. And, even though we came close to saying in <i>West Virginia </i>that such interest is generally available, we did not go that far. Even in 1987-five years after the Debt Collection Act was passed-it was not clear to us, to Congress, or to the States that the obligation of a State to pay prejudgment interest to the Government would extend to a typical contract claim.</p><p>Thus, even though the Court today suggests that its decision is merely an application of <i>Board of Comm\'rs </i>and <i>West Virginia, </i>it actually takes a significant and independent step toward equating the Government\'s right to collect prejudgment interest from the States with the Government\'s right</p><p>8 "The cases teach that interest is not recovered according to a rigid theory of compensation for money withheld, but is given in response to considerations offairness.
