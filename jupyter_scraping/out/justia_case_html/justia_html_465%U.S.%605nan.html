In late 1980, a grand jury, during the course of an investigation of corruption in the awarding of county and municipal contracts, served five subpoenas on respondent.  The first two demanded the production of the telephone records of several of respondent\'s companies and all records pertaining to four bank accounts of respondent and his companies.  The subpoenas were limited to the period between January 1, 1977, and the dates of the subpoenas.  The third subpoena demanded the production of a list of virtually all the business records of one of respondent\'s companies for the period between </p><p><a class="page-number" name="607">Page 465 U. S. 607</a></p><p> January 1, 1976, and the date of the subpoena. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The fourth subpoena sought production of a similar list of business records belonging to another company. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The final subpoena demanded production of all bank statements and cancelled checks of two of respondent\'s companies that had accounts at a bank in the Grand Cayman Islands.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Respondent filed a motion in Federal District Court seeking to quash the subpoenas.  The District Court for the District of New Jersey granted his motion except with respect to those documents and records required by law to be kept or disclosed to a public agency. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In reaching its decision, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="608">Page 465 U. S. 608</a></p><p> District Court noted that the Government had conceded that the materials sought in the subpoena were or might be incriminating.  The court stated that, therefore,</p>\n<p>"the relevant inquiry is . . . whether the <em>act</em> of producing the documents has communicative aspects which warrant Fifth Amendment protection."</p>\n<p><em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled March 19, 1980,</em> 541 F.Supp. 1, 3 (1981) (emphasis in original).  The court found that the act of production would compel respondent to "admit that the records exist, that they are in his possession, and that they are authentic."  <em>Ibid.</em>  While not ruling out the possibility that the Government could devise a way to ensure that the act of turning over the documents would not incriminate respondent, the court held that the Government had not made such a showing.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed.  <em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled March 19, 1980,</em> 680 F.2d 327 (1982).  It first addressed the question whether the Fifth Amendment ever applies to the records of a sole proprietorship.  After noting that an individual may not assert the Fifth Amendment privilege on behalf of a corporation, partnership, or other collective entity under the holding of <em>Bellis v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/417/85/case.html">417 U. S. 85</a></span> (1974), [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the Court of Appeals reasoned that the owner of a sole proprietorship acts in a personal, rather than a representative, capacity.  As a result, the court held that respondent\'s claim of the privilege was not foreclosed by the reasoning of <em>Bellis.</em>  680 F.2d at 331.</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals next considered whether the documents at issue in this case are privileged.  The court noted that this Court held in <em>Fisher v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html">425 U. S. 391</a></span> (1976), that the contents of business records ordinarily are </p><p><a class="page-number" name="609">Page 465 U. S. 609</a></p><p> not privileged because they are created voluntarily, and without compulsion.  The Court of Appeals nevertheless found that respondent\'s business records were privileged under either of two analyses.  First, the court reasoned that, notwithstanding the holdings in <em>Bellis</em> and <em>Fisher,</em> the business records of a sole proprietorship are no different from the individual owner\'s personal records.  Noting that Third Circuit cases had held that private papers, although created voluntarily, are protected by the Fifth Amendment, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] the court accorded the same protection to respondent\'s business papers. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Second, it held that respondent\'s act of producing the subpoenaed records would have "communicative aspects of its own."  680 F.2d at 335.  The turning over of the subpoenaed documents to the grand jury would admit their existence and authenticity.  Accordingly, respondent was entitled to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than produce the subpoenaed documents.</p>\n<p>The Government contended that the court should enforce the subpoenas because of the Government\'s offer not to use respondent\'s act of production against respondent in any </p><p><a class="page-number" name="610">Page 465 U. S. 610</a></p><p> way.  The Court of Appeals noted that no formal request for use immunity under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6002 and 6003 had been made.  In light of this failure, the court held that the District Court did not err in rejecting the Government\'s attempt to compel delivery of the subpoenaed records.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari to resolve the apparent conflict between the Court of Appeals\' holding and the reasoning underlying this Court\'s holding in <em>Fisher.</em>  461 U.S. 913 (1983).  We now affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The Court in <em>Fisher</em> expressly declined to reach the question whether the Fifth Amendment privilege protects the contents of an individual\'s tax records in his possession. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The rationale underlying our holding in that case is, however, persuasive here.  As we noted in <em>Fisher,</em> the Fifth Amendment protects the person asserting the privilege only from compelled self-incrimination.  425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#396">425 U. S. 396</a></span>.  Where the preparation of business records is voluntary, no compulsion is present. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  A subpoena that demands production of documents </p><p><a class="page-number" name="611">Page 465 U. S. 611</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"does not compel oral testimony; nor would it ordinarily compel the taxpayer to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of the contents of the documents sought."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U. S. 409</a></span>.  Applying this reasoning in <em>Fisher,</em> we stated:</p>\n<p>"[T]he Fifth Amendment would not be violated by the fact alone that the papers, on their face, might incriminate the taxpayer, for the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own compelled testimonial communications.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/384/757/case.html">Schmerber v. California,</a></span></em> [384 U.S. 757 (1966)]; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/388/218/case.html">United States v. Wade,</a></span></em> [388 U.S. 218 (1967)]; and <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/388/263/case.html">Gilbert v. California,</a></span></em> [388 U.S. 263 (1967)].  The accountant\'s workpapers are not the taxpayer\'s.  They were not prepared by the taxpayer, and they contain no testimonial declarations by him.  Furthermore, as far as this record demonstrates, the preparation of all of the papers sought in these cases was wholly voluntary, and they cannot be said to contain compelled testimonial evidence, either of the taxpayer or of anyone else.  The taxpayer cannot avoid compliance with the subpoena merely by asserting that the item of evidence which he is required to produce contains incriminating writing, whether his own or that of someone else."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U. S. 409</a></span>-410.</p>\n<p>This reasoning applies with equal force here.  Respondent does not contend that he prepared the documents involuntarily, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="612">Page 465 U. S. 612</a></p><p> or that the subpoena would force him to restate, repeat, or affirm the truth of their contents.  The fact that the records are in respondent\'s possession is irrelevant to the determination of whether the creation of the records was compelled.  We therefore hold that the contents of those records are not privileged. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Although the contents of a document may not be privileged, the act of producing the document may be.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U. S. 410</a></span>.  A government subpoena compels the holder of the document to perform an act that may have testimonial aspects and an incriminating effect.  As we noted in <em>Fisher</em>: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="613">Page 465 U. S. 613</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"Compliance with the subpoena tacitly concedes the existence of the papers demanded and their possession or control by the taxpayer.  It also would indicate the taxpayer\'s belief that the papers are those described in the subpoena.  <em>Curcio v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/354/118/case.html">354 U. S. 118</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/354/118/case.html#125">354 U. S. 125</a></span> (1957).  The elements of compulsion are clearly present, but the more difficult issues are whether the tacit averments of the taxpayer are both \'testimonial\' and \'incriminating\' for purposes of applying the Fifth Amendment.  These questions perhaps do not lend themselves to categorical answers; their resolution may instead depend on the facts and circumstances of particular cases or classes thereof."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U. S. 410</a></span>.  In <em>Fisher,</em> the Court explored the effect that the act of production would have on the taxpayer and determined that the act of production would have only minimal testimonial value and would not operate to incriminate the taxpayer.  Unlike the Court in <em>Fisher,</em> we have the explicit finding of the District Court that the act of producing the documents would involve testimonial self-incrimination. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  The Court of Appeals agreed. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The District Court\'s finding essentially rests on its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="614">Page 465 U. S. 614</a></p><p> determination of factual issues.  <em>See United States v. Nixon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html">418 U. S. 683</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html#702">418 U. S. 702</a></span> (1974).  Therefore, we will not overturn that finding unless it has no support in the record.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Traditionally, we also have been reluctant to disturb findings of fact in which two courts below have concurred.  <em>Rogers v. Lodge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html">458 U. S. 613</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/case.html#623">458 U. S. 623</a></span> (1982).  We therefore decline to overturn the finding of the District Court in this regard, where, as here, it has been affirmed by the Court of Appeals. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Government, as it concedes, could have compelled respondent to produce the documents listed in the subpoena.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="615">Page 465 U. S. 615</a></p><p> Title 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 6002 and 6003 provide for the granting of use immunity with respect to the potentially incriminating evidence. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The Court upheld the constitutionality of the use immunity statute in <em>Kastigar v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/case.html">406 U. S. 441</a></span> (1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="616">Page 465 U. S. 616</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Government did state several times before the District Court that it would not use respondent\'s act of production against him in any way.  But counsel for the Government never made a statutory request to the District Court to grant respondent use immunity. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  We are urged to adopt a doctrine of constructive use immunity.  Under this doctrine, the courts would impose a requirement on the Government not to use the incriminatory aspects of the act of production against the person claiming the privilege even though the statutory procedures have not been followed.</p>\n<p>We decline to extend the jurisdiction of courts to include prospective grants of use immunity in the absence of the formal request that the statute requires. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  As we stated in <em>Pillsbury Co. v. Conboy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/248/case.html">459 U. S. 248</a></span> (1983), in passing the use immunity statute, "Congress gave certain officials in the Department of Justice exclusive authority to grant immunities."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/248/case.html#253">459 U. S. 253</a></span>-254 (footnotes omitted).

S. 254</a></span>, n. 11.  The decision to seek use immunity necessarily involves a balancing of the Government\'s interest in obtaining information against the risk that immunity will frustrate the Government\'s attempts to prosecute the subject of the investigation.  <em>See United States v. Mandujano,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/564/case.html">425 U. S. 564</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/564/case.html#575">425 U. S. 575</a></span> (1976) (plurality opinion). Congress expressly left this decision exclusively to the Justice </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 465 U. S. 617</a></p><p> Department.  If, on remand, the appropriate official concludes that it is desirable to compel respondent to produce his business records, the statutory procedure for requesting use immunity will be available. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>We conclude that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the contents of the subpoenaed documents were privileged under the Fifth Amendment.

The judgment of the Court of Appeals is, therefore, affirmed in part and reversed in part, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] and the case is remanded to the District Court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 465 U.

In support of this hypothesis, he quotes extensively from that portion of the Court of Appeals\' opinion that addresses the act-of-production issue.  The quoted passage, however, begins <em>after</em> the court has discussed whether the records themselves are privileged.  After noting that <em>Fisher</em> could be read to deprive the contents of a sole proprietorship\'s records of Fifth Amendment protection, the court noted that other Third Circuit cases -- principally <em>ICC v. Gould, supra,</em> had refused to adopt that interpretation.  The court stated:</p>\n<p>"<em>Gould,</em> then, stands for the proposition that an individual\'s business papers, as well as his personal records, cannot be subpoenaed by a grand jury."</p>\n<p>680 F.2d at 334 (footnote omitted).

The <em>Fisher</em> documents were accountant\'s workpapers in the possession of the taxpayers\' lawyers.  The workpapers related to the taxpayers\' individual personal returns.  To that extent, the documents were personal, even though in the possession of a third party.  In contrast, each of the documents sought here pertained to respondent\'s businesses.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent\'s principal argument is that the Fifth Amendment should be read as creating a "zone of privacy which protects an individual and his personal records from compelled production."

While not directly on point, <em>Andresen v. Maryland, supra,</em> is consistent with our holding.  In <em>Andresen,</em> investigators from a bi-county fraud unit obtained warrants to search the petitioner\'s office.  During the search, the investigators seized several incriminating business records relating to the petitioner\'s practice as a sole practitioner of real estate law.  The petitioner sought suppression of the documents on Fourth and Fifth Amendment grounds.  The petitioner based his Fifth Amendment argument on</p>\n<p>"dicta in a number of cases which imply, or state, that the search for and seizure of a person\'s private papers violate the privilege against self-incrimination."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/463/case.html#471">427 U.

The Court dismissed this argument and found the documents not to be privileged, because the petitioner "had voluntarily committed to writing" any incriminating statements contained therein.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/463/case.html#473">427 U. S. 473</a></span>.  Although <em>Andresen</em> involved a search warrant, rather than a subpoena, the underlying principle is the same in this context.  If the party asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege has voluntarily compiled the document, no compulsion is present and the contents of the document are not privileged.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court stated:</p>\n<p>"With few exceptions, enforcement of the subpoenas would compel [respondent] to admit that the records exist, that they are in his possession, and that they are authentic.  These communications, if made under compulsion of a court decree, would violate [respondent\'s] Fifth Amendment rights. . . .  The government argues that the existence, possession and authenticity of the documents can be proved without [respondent\'s] testimonial communication, but it cannot satisfy this court as to how that representation can be implemented to protect the witness in subsequent proceedings."</p>\n<p>541 F.Supp. at 3.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals stated:</p>\n<p>"In the matter <em>sub judice,</em> however, we find nothing in the record that would indicate that the United States knows, as a certainty, that each of the myriad documents demanded by the five subpoenas in fact is in the appellee\'s possession or subject to his control.  The most plausible inference to be drawn from the broad-sweeping subpoenas is that the Government, unable to prove that the subpoenaed documents exist -- or that the appellee even is somehow connected to the business entities under investigation -- is attempting to compensate for its lack of knowledge by requiring the appellee to become, in effect, the primary informant against himself."</p>\n<p>680 F.2d at 335 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The Government concedes that the act of producing the subpoenaed documents might have had some testimonial aspects, but it argues that any incrimination would be so trivial that the Fifth Amendment is not implicated.  The Government finds support for this argument in <em>Marchetti v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html">390 U. S. 39</a></span> (1968).  In <em>Marchetti,</em> the Court stated that a party who wishes to claim the Fifth Amendment privilege must be "confronted by substantial and <em>real,\' and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of incrimination."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/390/39/case.html#53">390 U.

On the basis of the findings made in this case, we think it clear that the risk of incrimination was "substantial and real," and not "trifling or imaginary."  Respondent did not concede in the District Court that the records listed in the subpoena actually existed or were in his possession.  Respondent argued that, by producing the records, he would tacitly admit their existence and his possession.  Respondent also pointed out that, if the Government obtained the documents from another source, it would have to authenticate them before they would be admissible at trial.  <em>See</em> Fed.Rule Evid. 901.  By producing the documents, respondent would relieve the Government of the need for authentication.  These allegations were sufficient to establish a valid claim of the privilege against self-incrimination.  This is not to say that the Government was foreclosed from rebutting respondent\'s claim by producing evidence that possession, existence, and authentication were a "foregone conclusion."  <em>Fisher,</em> 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/391/case.html#411">425 U.

Mandujano,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/564/case.html">425 U.

S. 255</a></span> (1966).  The difference between that situation and the Government\'s theory of constructive use immunity is that, in the latter, it is the grant of judicially enforceable use immunity that compels the witness to testify.  In the former situation, exclusion of the witness\' testimony is used to deter the Government from future violations of witnesses\' Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T17" name="F17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent argues that any grant of use immunity must cover the contents of the documents, as well as the act of production.  We find this contention unfounded.  To satisfy the requirements of the Fifth Amendment, a grant of immunity need be only as broad as the privilege against self-incrimination.  <em>Murphy v. Waterfront Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/378/52/case.html">378 U.

As discussed above, the privilege in this case extends only to the act of production.  Therefore, any grant of use immunity need only protect respondent from the self-incrimination that might accompany the act of producing his business records.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T18" name="F18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS states that we should affirm the Court of Appeals decision as a whole because our reasoning is entirely consistent with that of the courts below.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/605/case.html#623">465 U.

It is that aspect of the court\'s opinion that we reverse today.

I write separately, however, just to make explicit what is implicit in the analysis of that opinion:  that the Fifth Amendment provides absolutely no protection for the contents of private papers of any kind.  The notion that the Fifth Amendment protects the privacy of papers originated in <em>Boyd v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/616/case.html">116 U.

I dissent, however, with respect to that part of the Court\'s opinion reversing the Court of Appeals.  The basis for the reversal is the majority\'s disagreement with the Court of Appeals\' discussion of whether the Fifth Amendment protected the contents of the documents respondent sought to withhold from disclosure.  Inasmuch as the Court of Appeals\' judgment did not rest upon the disposition of this issue, this Court errs by reaching out to decide it.

[<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\'s reasoning and affirmed.  It explained:</p>\n<p>"To be sure, the documents requested here, like those sought in <em>Fisher,</em> were voluntarily prepared, and therefore \'cannot be said to contain compelled testimonial evidence\' in and of themselves.  <em>See Fisher,</em> supra, 425 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/425/391/case.html#409">425 U.

But the Supreme Court in <em>Fisher</em> went to great lengths to demonstrate that, in certain situations, the very act of producing subpoenaed records might amount to an incriminating declaration.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/425/391/case.html#410">425 U.

As the district court observed in this connection,"</p>\n<p>"   the government can give no assurances that the act of turning over the documents will not constitute incriminating </p><p><a class="page-number" name="622">Page 465 U.

The government argues that the existence, possession and authenticity of the documents can be proved without [the appellee\'s] testimonial communication, but it cannot satisfy this court as to how that representation can be implemented to protect [the appellee] in subsequent proceedings."</p>\n<p>"Appendix at 98 (footnote omitted).

"</p>\n<p>"Accordingly, we hold, therefore, that enforcement of these subpoenas would result in a compelled testimonial communication, an outcome neither compatible with the fifth amendment nor consonant with <em>Fisher.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>In re Grand Jury Empanelled March 19, 1980,</em> 680 F.2d 327, 334, 335-336 (CA3 1982).</p>\n<p>In addition, the Court of Appeals noted that the Government had had an opportunity to obtain the documents by providing the respondent with statutory immunity, but had declined to do so.  It wrote:</p>\n<p>"Finally, the United States argues that the district court erred in not compelling the appellee to produce the subpoenaed documents subject to \'the functional equivalent of use immunity with respect to the act of production.\'  Under this arrangement, presumably the appellee would turn over the requested records to the Government, which in turn would be obligated not to use the appellee\'s act of production against him in any way."</p>\n<p>"We are unpersuaded by the Government\'s proposition.  As the appellee stresses, although the Government, on a number of occasions, suggested to the district court that there were means by which the appellee\'s act of production could be immunized, no procedure ever </p><p><a class="page-number" name="623">Page 465 U. S. 623</a></p><p> was agreed upon and no formal immunization offer under 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 6002 or \xc2\xa7 6003 was advanced.  Given this failure on the part of the Government to identify with particularity the immunity proposal it envisioned, we cannot say that the district court erred in rejecting this approach, especially in view of the court\'s finding that"</p>\n<p>"   the government can give no assurances that the act of turning over the documents will not constitute incriminating admissions against [the appellee] either before the grand jury or at a subsequent trial."</p>\n<p>"Appendix at 98; <em>see United States v.
