The District Court declared Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent invalid under the \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d bar since he had leased his interactive securities trading system to a securities brokerage \xe2\x80\x9cmore than one year prior to the date of the [patent] application.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(b).  In a motion for reconsideration, Minton argued for the first time that the lease was part of ongoing testing, and therefore fell within the \xe2\x80\x9cexperimental use\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the on-sale bar.  The District Court denied the motion and the Federal Circuit affirmed, concluding that the District Court had appropriately held that argument waived.  Convinced that his attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 failure to timely raise the argument cost him the lawsuit and led to the invalidation of his patent, Minton brought a legal malpractice action in Texas state court.  His former attorneys argued that Minton\xe2\x80\x99s infringement claims would have failed even if the experimental-use argument had been timely raised, and the trial court agreed.  On appeal, Minton claimed that the federal district courts had exclusive jurisdiction over claims like his under \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71338(a), which provides for exclusive federal jurisdiction over any case \xe2\x80\x9carising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minton argued that the state trial court had therefore lacked jurisdiction, and he should be able to start over with his malpractice suit in federal court.  Applying the test of Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg., \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n, the Texas Court of Appeals rejected Minton\xe2\x80\x99s argument, proceeded to the merits, and determined that Minton had failed to establish experimental use.  The Texas Supreme Court reversed, concluding that the case properly belonged in federal court because the success of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim relied upon a question of federal patent law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa71338(a) does not deprive the state courts of subject matter jurisdiction over Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim.

Because federal law did not create the cause of action asserted by Minton\xe2\x80\x99s legal malpractice claim, the claim can \xe2\x80\x9caris[e] under\xe2\x80\x9d federal patent law only if it \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily raise[s] a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grable, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314.

To prevail on his claim, Minton must show that an experimental-use argument would have prevailed if only petitioners had timely made it in the earlier patent litigation.  That hypothetical patent case within the malpractice case must be resolved to decide Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim.

The substantiality inquiry looks to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole.  Here, the federal issue does not carry the necessary significance.  No matter how the state courts resolve the hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9ccase within a case,\xe2\x80\x9d the real-world result of the prior federal patent litigation will not change.  Nor will allowing state courts to resolve these cases undermine \xe2\x80\x9cthe development of a uniform body of [patent] law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141\n.  The federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases, and in resolving the nonhypothetical patent questions those cases present they are of course not bound by state precedents.  Minton suggests that state courts\xe2\x80\x99 answers to hypothetical patent questions can sometimes have real-world effect on other patents through issue preclusion, but even assuming that is true, such \xe2\x80\x9cfact-bound and situation-specific\xe2\x80\x9d effects are not sufficient to establish arising under jurisdiction, Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677\n.  Finally, the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 greater familiarity with patent law is not enough, by itself, to trigger the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 exclusive patent jurisdiction.

In March 1995, he leased the system\xe2\x80\x94known as the Texas Computer Exchange Network, or TEXCEN\xe2\x80\x94to R.\xc2\xa0M. Stark &amp; Co., a securities brokerage.  A little over a year later, he applied for a patent for an interactive securities trading system that was based substantially on TEXCEN.  The U.\xc2\xa0S. Patent and Trademark Office issued the patent in January 2000.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPatent in hand, Minton filed a patent infringement suit in Federal District Court against the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) and the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc.  He was represented by Jerry Gunn and the other petitioners.  NASD and NASDAQ moved for summary judgment on the ground that Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent was invalid under the \xe2\x80\x9con sale\xe2\x80\x9d bar, \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7102(b).  That provision specifies that an inventor is not entitled to a patent if \xe2\x80\x9cthe invention was .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on sale in [the United States], more than one year prior to the date of the application,\xe2\x80\x9d and Minton had leased TEXCEN to Stark more than one year prior to filing his patent application.  Rejecting Minton\xe2\x80\x99s argument that there were differences between TEXCEN and the patented system that precluded application of the on-sale bar, the District Court granted the summary judgment motion and declared Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent invalid.  Minton v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 226 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 845, 873, 883\xe2\x80\x93884 (ED Tex. 2002).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMinton then filed a motion for reconsideration in the District Court, arguing for the first time that the lease agreement with Stark was part of ongoing testing of TEXCEN and therefore fell within the \xe2\x80\x9cexperimental use\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the on-sale bar.  See generally Pfaff v. Wells Electronics, Inc., \n\n525 U.\xc2\xa0S. 55, \n64 (1998)\n (describing the exception).  The District Court denied the motion.  Minton v.

Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  That court affirmed, concluding that the District Court had appropriately held Minton\xe2\x80\x99s experimental-use argument waived.  See Minton v. National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc., 336 F.\xc2\xa03d 1373, 1379\xe2\x80\x931380 (CA Fed. 2003).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMinton, convinced that his attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 failure to raise the experimental-use argument earlier had cost him the lawsuit and led to invalidation of his patent, brought this malpractice action in Texas state court.  His former lawyers defended on the ground that the lease to Stark was not, in fact, for an experimental use, and that therefore Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent infringement claims would have failed even if the experimental-use argument had been timely raised.  The trial court agreed, holding that Minton had put forward \xe2\x80\x9cless than a scintilla of proof\xe2\x80\x9d that the lease had been for an experimental purpose.  App. 213.  It accordingly granted summary judgment to Gunn and the other lawyer defendants.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal, Minton raised a new argument: Because his legal malpractice claim was based on an alleged error in a patent case, it \xe2\x80\x9caris[es] under\xe2\x80\x9d federal patent law for purposes of \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71338(a).  And because, under \xc2\xa71338(a), \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents,\xe2\x80\x9d the Texas court\xe2\x80\x94where Minton had originally brought his malpractice claim\xe2\x80\x94lacked subject matter jurisdiction to decide the case.  Accordingly, Minton argued, the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order should be vacated and the case dismissed, leaving Minton free to start over in the Federal District Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA divided panel of the Court of Appeals of Texas rejected Minton\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  Applying the test we articulated in Grable &amp; Sons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering &amp; Mfg., \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308, \n314 (2005)\n, it held that the federal interests implicated by Minton\xe2\x80\x99s state law claim were not sufficiently substantial to trigger \xc2\xa71338 \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction.  It also held that finding exclusive federal jurisdiction over state legal malpractice actions would, contrary to Grable\xe2\x80\x99s commands, disturb the balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.  Proceeding to the merits of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim, the Court of Appeals affirmed the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that Minton had failed to establish experimental use and that arguments on that ground therefore would not have saved his infringement suit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Court of Texas reversed, relying heavily on a pair of cases from the U.\xc2\xa0S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.  355 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 634, 641\xe2\x80\x93642 (2011) (discussing Air Measurement Technologies, Inc. v.

The Court concluded that Minton\xe2\x80\x99s claim involved \xe2\x80\x9ca substantial federal issue\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Grable \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the success of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use exception as a defense to the on-sale bar.\xe2\x80\x9d  355 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 644.  Adjudication of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s claim in federal court was consistent with the appropriate balance between federal and state judicial responsibilities, it held, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe federal government and patent litigants have an interest in the uniform application of patent law by courts well-versed in that subject matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 646 (citing Immunocept, supra, at 1285\xe2\x80\x931286; Air Measurement Technologies, supra, at 1272).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Guzman, joined by Justices Medina and Willett, dissented.

Adhering to the demands of \xe2\x80\x9c[l]inguistic consistency,\xe2\x80\x9d we have interpreted the phrase \xe2\x80\x9carising under\xe2\x80\x9d in both sections identically, applying our \xc2\xa71331 and \xc2\xa71338(a) precedents interchangeably.  See Christianson v. Colt Industries Operating Corp., \n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800\n\xe2\x80\x93809 (1988).  For cases falling within the patent-specific arising under jurisdiction of \xc2\xa71338(a), however, Congress has not only provided for federal jurisdiction but also eliminated state jurisdiction, decreeing that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o State court shall have jurisdiction over any claim for relief arising under any Act of Congress relating to patents.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71338(a) (2006 ed., Supp. V).

Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 677, \n699 (2006)\n.  In outlining the contours of this slim category, we do not paint on a blank canvas.  Unfortunately, the canvas looks like one that Jackson Pollock got to first.  See 13D C. Wright, A. Miller, E. Cooper, &amp; R.

Grable, 545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314.  That is, federal jurisdiction over a state law claim will lie if a federal issue is: (1) necessarily raised, (2) actually disputed, (3) substantial, and (4) capable of resolution in federal court without disrupting the federal-state balance approved by Congress.  Where all four of these requirements are met, we held, jurisdiction is proper because there is a \xe2\x80\x9cserious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,\xe2\x80\x9d which can be vindicated without disrupting Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intended division of labor between state and federal courts.

Indeed, for the reasons we discuss, we are comfortable concluding that state legal malpractice claims based on underlying patent matters will rarely, if ever, arise under federal patent law for purposes of \xc2\xa71338(a).  Although such cases may necessarily raise disputed questions of patent law, those cases are by their nature unlikely to have the sort of significance for the federal system necessary to establish jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo begin, we acknowledge that resolution of a federal patent question is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d to Minton\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Under Texas law, a plaintiff alleging legal malpractice must establish four elements: (1) that the defendant attorney owed the plaintiff a duty; (2) that the attorney breached that duty; (3) that the breach was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury; and (4) that damages occurred.  See Alexander v. Turtur &amp; Associates, Inc., 146 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d 113, 117 (Tex. 2004).  In cases like this one, in which the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s alleged error came in failing to make a particular argument, the causation element requires a \xe2\x80\x9ccase within a case\xe2\x80\x9d analysis of whether, had the argument been made, the outcome of the earlier litigation would have been different.  355 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 639; see 4 R. Mallen &amp; J. Smith, Legal Malpractice \xc2\xa737:15, pp. 1509\xe2\x80\x931520 (2012).  To prevail on his legal malpractice claim, therefore, Minton must show that he would have prevailed in his federal patent infringement case if only petitioners had timely made an experimental-use argument on his behalf.  355 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 644.  That will necessarily require application of patent law to the facts of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal issue is also \xe2\x80\x9cactually disputed\xe2\x80\x9d here\xe2\x80\x94indeed, on the merits, it is the central point of dispute.  Minton argues that the experimental-use exception properly applied to his lease to Stark, saving his patent from the on-sale bar; petitioners argue that it did not.

In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Supreme Court of Texas focused on the importance of the issue to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s case and to the parties before it.  355 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 644 (\xe2\x80\x9cbecause the success of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s malpractice claim is reliant upon the viability of the experimental use exception as a defense to the on-sale bar, we hold that it is a substantial federal issue\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Air Measurement Technologies, 504 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1272 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe issue is substantial, for it is a necessary element of the malpractice case\xe2\x80\x9d).  As our past cases show, however, it is not enough that the federal issue be significant to the particular parties in the immediate suit; that will always be true when the state claim \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily raise[s]\xe2\x80\x9d a disputed federal issue, as Grable separately requires.  The substantiality inquiry under Grable looks instead to the importance of the issue to the federal system as a whole.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Grable itself, for example, the Internal Revenue Service had seized property from the plaintiff and sold it to satisfy the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s federal tax delinquency.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 310\xe2\x80\x93311.  Five years later, the plaintiff filed a state law quiet title action against the third party that had purchased the property, alleging that the IRS had failed to comply with certain federally imposed notice requirements, so that the seizure and sale were invalid.  Ibid.  In holding that the case arose under federal law, we primarily focused not on the interests of the litigants themselves, but rather on the broader significance of the notice question for the Federal Government.  We emphasized the Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cstrong interest\xe2\x80\x9d in being able to recover delinquent taxes through seizure and sale of property, which in turn \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] clear terms of notice to allow buyers .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to satisfy themselves that the Service has touched the bases necessary for good title.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 315.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdirect interest in the availability of a federal forum to vindicate its own administrative action\xe2\x80\x9d made the question \xe2\x80\x9can important issue of federal law that sensibly belong[ed] in a federal court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA second illustration of the sort of substantiality we require comes from Smith v. Kansas City Title &amp; Trust Co., \n\n255 U.\xc2\xa0S. 180 (1921)\n, which Grable described as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he classic example\xe2\x80\x9d of a state claim arising under federal law.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 312.  In Smith, the plaintiff argued that the defendant bank could not purchase certain bonds issued by the Federal Government because the Government had acted unconstitutionally in issuing them.  255 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 198.  We held that the case arose under federal law, because the \xe2\x80\x9cdecision depends upon the determination\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe constitutional validity of an act of Congress which is directly drawn in question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 201.  Again, the relevant point was not the importance of the question to the parties alone but rather the importance more generally of a determination that the Government \xe2\x80\x9csecurities were issued under an unconstitutional law, and hence of no validity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see also Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, \n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 804\n, n.\xc2\xa012 (1986).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, the federal issue carries no such significance.  Because of the backward-looking nature of a legal malpractice claim, the question is posed in a merely hypothetical sense: If Minton\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers had raised a timely experimental-use argument, would the result in the patent infringement proceeding have been different?  No matter how the state courts resolve that hypothetical \xe2\x80\x9ccase within a case,\xe2\x80\x9d it will not change the real-world result of the prior federal patent litigation.  Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent will remain invalid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor will allowing state courts to resolve these cases undermine \xe2\x80\x9cthe development of a uniform body of [patent] law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bonito Boats, Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats, Inc., \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 141, \n162 (1989)\n.  Congress ensured such uniformity by vesting exclusive jurisdiction over actual patent cases in the federal district courts and exclusive appellate jurisdiction in the Federal Circuit.  See 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71338(a), 1295(a)(1).  In resolving the nonhypothetical patent questions those cases present, the federal courts are of course not bound by state court case-within-a-case patent rulings.  See Tafflin v. Levitt, \n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 455, \n465 (1990)\n.  In any event, the state court case-within-a-case inquiry asks what would have happened in the prior federal proceeding if a particular argument had been made.  In answering that question, state courts can be expected to hew closely to the pertinent federal precedents.  It is those precedents, after all, that would have applied had the argument been made.  Cf. ibid. (\xe2\x80\x9cState courts adjudicating civil RICO claims will .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be guided by federal court interpretations of the relevant federal criminal statutes, just as federal courts sitting in diversity are guided by state court interpretations of state law\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs for more novel questions of patent law that may arise for the first time in a state court \xe2\x80\x9ccase within a case,\xe2\x80\x9d they will at some point be decided by a federal court in the context of an actual patent case, with review in the Federal Circuit.  If the question arises frequently, it will soon be resolved within the federal system, laying to rest any contrary state court precedent; if it does not arise frequently, it is unlikely to implicate substantial federal interests.  The present case is \xe2\x80\x9cpoles apart from Grable,\xe2\x80\x9d in which a state court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the federal question \xe2\x80\x9cwould be controlling in numerous other cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc., 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 700.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMinton also suggests that state courts\xe2\x80\x99 answers to hypothetical patent questions can sometimes have real-world effect on other patents through issue preclusion.  Brief for Respondent 33\xe2\x80\x9336.  Minton, for example, has filed what is known as a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuation patent\xe2\x80\x9d application related to his original patent.  See \n\n35 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7120; 4A D. Chisum, Patents \xc2\xa713.03 (2005) (describing continuation applications).  He argues that, in evaluating this separate application, the patent examiner could be bound by the Texas trial court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the scope of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s original patent.  See Brief for Respondent 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  It is unclear whether this is true.  The Patent and Trademark Office\xe2\x80\x99s Manual of Patent Examining Procedure provides that res judicata is a proper ground for rejecting a patent \xe2\x80\x9conly when the earlier decision was a decision of the Board of Appeals\xe2\x80\x9d or certain federal reviewing courts, giving no indication that state court decisions would have preclusive effect.  See Dept. of Commerce, Patent and Trademark Office, Manual of Patent Examining Procedure \xc2\xa7706.03(w), p.\xc2\xa0700\xe2\x80\x9379 (rev. 8th ed. 2012); 35  U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7134(a), 141, 145; Reply Brief 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  In fact, Minton has not identified any case finding such preclusive effect based on a state court decision.  But even assuming that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s case-within-a-case adjudication may be preclusive under some circumstances, the result would be limited to the parties and patents that had been before the state court.  Such \xe2\x80\x9cfact-bound and situation-specific\xe2\x80\x9d effects are not sufficient to establish federal arising under jurisdiction.  Empire HealthChoice Assurance, Inc., supra, at 701.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor can we accept the suggestion that the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 greater familiarity with patent law means that legal malpractice cases like this one belong in federal court.  See Air Measurement Technologies, 504 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1272 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe litigants will also benefit from federal judges who have experience in claim construction and infringement matters\xe2\x80\x9d); 355 S.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa03d, at 646 (\xe2\x80\x9cpatent litigants have an interest in the uniform application of patent law by courts well-versed in that subject matter\xe2\x80\x9d).  It is true that a similar interest was among those we considered in Grable.  545 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314.  But the possibility that a state court will incorrectly resolve a state claim is not, by itself, enough to trigger the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 exclusive patent jurisdiction, even if the potential error finds its root in a misunderstanding of patent law.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no doubt that resolution of a patent issue in the context of a state legal malpractice action can be vitally important to the particular parties in that case.  But something more, demonstrating that the question is significant to the federal system as a whole, is needed.

That requirement is concerned with the appropriate \xe2\x80\x9cbalance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

In this case, although the state courts must answer a question of patent law to resolve Minton\xe2\x80\x99s legal malpractice claim, their answer will have no broader effects.  It will not stand as binding precedent for any future patent claim; it will not even affect the validity of Minton\xe2\x80\x99s patent.  Accordingly, there is no \xe2\x80\x9cserious federal interest in claiming the advantages thought to be inherent in a federal forum,\xe2\x80\x9d Grable, supra, at 313.
