His mother requested that Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s place of birth be listed as \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d on a consular report of birth abroad and on his passport, pursuant to \xc2\xa7214(d) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003.  That provision states: \xe2\x80\x9cFor purposes of the registration of birth, certification of nationality, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the request of the citizen or the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S. officials refused the request, citing a State Department policy that prohibits recording \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d as the place of birth for those born in Jerusalem.  Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s parents filed a suit on his behalf against the Secretary of State.  The District Court dismissed the case, holding that it presented a nonjusticiable political question regarding Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x99s political status.  The D. C. Circuit affirmed, reasoning that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of that power cannot be reviewed by the courts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The political question doctrine does not bar judicial review of Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pp. 5\xe2\x88\x9212.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0This Court has said that a controversy \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves a political question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. where there is \xe2\x80\x98a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Nixon v. United States, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224\n.  The lower courts ruled that this case presents such a political question because they misunderstood the issue, assuming resolution of Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim would require the Judiciary to define U.\xc2\xa0S. policy regarding the status of Jerusalem.  In fact, this case asks the courts to determine only whether Zivotofsky can vindicate his statutory right under \xc2\xa7214(d) to choose to have Israel recorded as his place of birth on his passport.  Making such determinations is a familiar judicial exercise.  Moreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of \xc2\xa7214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional.  There is no \xe2\x80\x9ctextually demonstrable constitutional commitment\xe2\x80\x9d of that question to another branch:  At least since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, this Court has recognized that it is \xe2\x80\x9cemphatically the province and duty\xe2\x80\x9d of the Judiciary to determine the constitutionality of a statute.  Nor is there \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving\xe2\x80\x9d the question: Both parties offer detailed legal arguments concerning whether the textual, structural, and historical evidence supports a determination that \xc2\xa7214(d) is constitutional.

The State Department declined to follow that law, citing its longstanding policy of not taking a position on the political status of Jerusalem.  When sued by an American who invoked the statute, the Secretary of State argued that the courts lacked authority to decide the case because it presented a political question.

Section 214 of the Act is entitled \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1365.  The first two subsections express Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommitment\xe2\x80\x9d to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.  Id., at 1365\xe2\x80\x931366.  The third bars funding for the publication of official Government documents that do not list Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.  Id., at 1366.  The fourth and final provision, \xc2\xa7214(d), is the only one at stake in this case.  Entitled \xe2\x80\x9cRecord of Place of Birth as Israel for Passport Purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d it provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or purposes of the registration of birth, certification of national- ity, or issuance of a passport of a United States citizen born in the city of Jerusalem, the Secretary shall, upon the re- quest of the citizen or the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s legal guardian, record the place of birth as Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State Department\xe2\x80\x99s Foreign Affairs Manual states that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the birthplace of the applicant is located in territory disputed by another country, the city or area of birth may be written in the passport.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 Foreign Affairs Manual \xc2\xa71383.5\xe2\x80\x932, App. 108.

In signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act into law, President George W. Bush stated his belief that \xc2\xa7214 \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly interferes with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority to conduct the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Statement on Signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, Public Papers of the Presidents, George W.

He added that if the section is \xe2\x80\x9cconstrued as mandatory,\xe2\x80\x9d then it would \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere with the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority to formulate the position of the United States, speak for the Nation in international affairs, and determine the terms on which recognition is given to foreign states.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  He concluded by emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cU.\xc2\xa0S. policy regarding Jerusalem has not changed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The President made no specific reference to the passport mandate in \xc2\xa7214(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Menachem Binyamin Zivotofsky was born in Jerusalem on October 17, 2002, shortly after \xc2\xa7214(d) was enacted.  Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s parents were American citizens and he accordingly was as well, by virtue of congressional enactment.  \n\n8 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71401(c); see Rogers v.

Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s mother filed an application for a consular report of birth abroad and a United States passport.  She requested that his place of birth be listed as \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem, Israel\xe2\x80\x9d on both documents.  U.\xc2\xa0S. officials informed Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s mother that State Department policy prohibits recording \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d as Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s place of birth.  Pursuant to that policy, Zivotofsky was issued a passport and consular report of birth abroad listing only \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 19\xe2\x80\x9320.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tZivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s parents filed a complaint on his behalf against the Secretary of State.  Zivotofsky sought a declaratory judgment and a permanent injunction ordering the Secretary to identify his place of birth as \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem, Israel\xe2\x80\x9d in the official documents.  Id., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  The District Court granted the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss the complaint on the grounds that Zivotofsky lacked standing and that his complaint presented a nonjusticiable political question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit reversed, concluding that Zivotofsky did have standing.  It then observed that while Zivotofsky had originally asked that \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem, Israel\xe2\x80\x9d be recorded on his passport, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]oth sides agree that the question now is whether \xc2\xa7214(d) entitles [him] to have just \xe2\x80\x98Israel\xe2\x80\x99 listed as his place of birth.\xe2\x80\x9d  444 F.\xc2\xa03d 614, 619 (2006).  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit determined that additional factual development might be helpful in deciding whether this question was justiciable, as the parties disagreed about the foreign policy implications of listing \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d alone as a birthplace on the passport.  Id., at 619\xe2\x80\x93620.  It therefore remanded the case to the District Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe District Court again found that the case was not justiciable.  It explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]esolving [Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s] claim on the merits would necessarily require the Court to decide the political status of Jerusalem.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 97, 103 (2007).  Concluding that the claim therefore presented a political question, the District Court dismissed the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit affirmed.  It reasoned that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns, and that the exercise of this power cannot be reviewed by the courts.  Therefore, \xe2\x80\x9cdeciding whether the Secretary of State must mark a passport .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as Zivotofsky requests would necessarily draw [the court] into an area of decisionmaking the Constitution leaves to the Executive alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  571 F.\xc2\xa03d 1227, 1232\xe2\x80\x931233 (2009).  The D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit held that the political question doctrine prohibits such an intrusion by the courts, and rejected any suggestion that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s decision to take \xe2\x80\x9ca position on the status of Jerusalem\xe2\x80\x9d could change the analysis.  Id., at 1233.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJudge Edwards concurred in the judgment, but wrote separately to express his view that the political question doctrine has no application to this case.  He explained that the issue before the court was whether \xc2\xa7214(d) \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissibly intrude[s] on the President\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive power to recognize foreign sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1234.  That question, he observed, involves \xe2\x80\x9ccommonplace issues of statutory and constitutional interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d plainly within the constitutional authority of the Judiciary to decide.  Id., at 1235.  Reaching the merits, Judge Edwards determined that designating Israel as a place of birth on a passport is a policy \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of the recognition power.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1243.  Because in his view the Constitution gives that power exclusively to the President, Judge Edwards found \xc2\xa7214(d) unconstitutional.  For this reason, he concluded that Zivotofsky had no viable cause of action, and concurred in affirming the dismissal of the complaint.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tZivotofsky petitioned for certiorari, and we granted review.  563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe lower courts concluded that Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim presents a political question and therefore cannot be ad- judicated.

Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).  Our precedents have identified a narrow exception to that rule, known as the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical question\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine.  See, e.g., Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., \n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221, \n230 (1986)\n.  We have explained that a controversy \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves a political question .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. where there is \xe2\x80\x98a textu- ally demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Nixon v.

The District Court understood Zivotofsky to ask the courts to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide the political status of Jerusalem.\xe2\x80\x9d  511 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 103.  This misunderstands the issue presented.  Zivotofsky does not ask the courts to determine whether Jerusalem is the capital of Israel.  He instead seeks to determine whether he may vindicate his statutory right, under \xc2\xa7214(d), to choose to have Israel recorded on his passport as his place of birth.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor its part, the D.\xc2\xa0C.

That court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly the Executive\xe2\x80\x94not Congress and not the courts\xe2\x80\x94has the power to define U.\xc2\xa0S. policy regarding Israel\xe2\x80\x99s sovereignty over Jerusalem,\xe2\x80\x9d and also to \xe2\x80\x9cdecide how best to implement that policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  571 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1232.  Because the Department\xe2\x80\x99s passport rule was adopted to implement the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive and unreviewable constitutional power to keep the United States out of the debate over the status of Jerusalem,\xe2\x80\x9d the validity of that rule was itself a \xe2\x80\x9cnonjusticiable political question\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution leaves to the Executive alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1231\xe2\x80\x931233.  Indeed, the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not even mention \xc2\xa7214(d) until the fifth of its six paragraphs of analysis, and then only to dismiss it as irrelevant: \xe2\x80\x9cThat Congress took a position on the status of Jerusalem and gave Zivotofsky a statutory cause of action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is of no moment to whether the judiciary has [the] authority to resolve this dispute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1233.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe existence of a statutory right, however, is certainly relevant to the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s power to decide Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  The federal courts are not being asked to supplant a foreign policy decision of the political branches with the courts\xe2\x80\x99 own unmoored determination of what United States policy toward Jerusalem should be.  Instead, Zivotofsky requests that the courts enforce a specific statutory right.  To resolve his claim, the Judiciary must decide if Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the statute is correct, and whether the statute is constitutional.  This is a familiar judicial exercise.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, because the parties do not dispute the interpretation of \xc2\xa7214(d), the only real question for the courts is whether the statute is constitutional.  At least since Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137 (1803), we have recognized that when an Act of Congress is alleged to conflict with the Constitution, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 177.  That duty will sometimes involve the \xe2\x80\x9c[r]esolution of litigation challenging the constitutional authority of one of the three branches,\xe2\x80\x9d but courts cannot avoid their responsibility merely \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the issues have political implications.\xe2\x80\x9d  INS v. Chadha, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 919, \n943 (1983)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, determining the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7214(d) involves deciding whether the statute impermissibly intrudes upon Presidential powers under the Constitution.  If so, the law must be invalidated and Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s case should be dismissed for failure to state a claim.  If, on the other hand, the statute does not trench on the President\xe2\x80\x99s powers, then the Secretary must be ordered to issue Zivotofsky a passport that complies with \xc2\xa7214(d).  Either way, the political question doctrine is not implicated.  \xe2\x80\x9cNo policy underlying the political question doctrine suggests that Congress or the Executive .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. can decide the constitutionality of a statute; that is a decision for the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 941\xe2\x80\x93942.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Secretary contends that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is \xe2\x80\x98a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the President of the sole power to recognize foreign sovereigns and, as a corollary, to determine whether an American born in Jerusalem may choose to have Israel listed as his place of birth on his passport.  Nixon, 506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 228 (quoting Baker, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 217); see Brief for Respondent 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  Perhaps.  But there is, of course, no exclusive commitment to the Executive of the power to determine the constitutionality of a statute.  The Judicial Branch appropriately exercises that authority, including in a case such as this, where the question is whether Congress or the Executive is \xe2\x80\x9caggrandizing its power at the expense of another branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  Freytag v. Commissioner, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868, \n878 (1991)\n; see, e.g., Myers v. United States, \n\n272 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52, \n176 (1926)\n (finding a statute unconstitutional because it encroached upon the President\xe2\x80\x99s removal power); Bowsher v. Synar, \n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 714, \n734 (1986)\n (finding a statute un- constitutional because it \xe2\x80\x9cintruded into the executive function\xe2\x80\x9d); Morrison v.

Nixon, supra, at 228 (quoting Baker, supra, at 217).  Framing the issue as the lower courts did, in terms of whether the Judiciary may decide the political status of Jerusalem, certainly raises those concerns.  They dissipate, however, when the issue is recognized to be the more focused one of the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7214(d).  Indeed, both sides offer detailed legal arguments regarding whether \xc2\xa7214(d) is constitutional in light of powers committed to the Executive, and whether Congress\xe2\x80\x99s own powers with respect to passports must be weighed in analyzing this question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, the Secretary reprises on the merits her argument on the political question issue, claiming that the Constitution gives the Executive the exclusive power to formulate recognition policy.

II, \xc2\xa73.  According to the Secretary, \xe2\x80\x9c[c]enturies-long Executive Branch practice, congressional acquiescence, and decisions by this Court\xe2\x80\x9d confirm that the \xe2\x80\x9creceive Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d clause confers upon the Executive the exclusive power of recognition.

The Secretary will not \xe2\x80\x9clist[] as a place of birth a country whose sovereignty over the relevant territory the United States does not recognize.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 39.  Therefore, she claims, \xe2\x80\x9clisting \xe2\x80\x98Israel\xe2\x80\x99 as the place of birth would constitute an official decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city located within Israel.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (some internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor his part, Zivotofsky argues that, far from being an exercise of the recognition power, \xc2\xa7214(d) is instead a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate and permissible\xe2\x80\x9d exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to legislate on the form and content of a passport.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 53.  He points the Court to Professor Louis Henkin\xe2\x80\x99s observation that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in the competition for power in foreign relations,\xe2\x80\x99 Congress has \xe2\x80\x98an impressive array of powers expressly enumerated in the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 45 (quoting L. Henkin, Foreign Affairs and the United States Constitution 63 (2d ed. 1996)).  Zivotofsky suggests that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority to enact \xc2\xa7214(d) derives specifically from its powers over naturalization, U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 4, and foreign commerce, id., \xc2\xa78, cl. 3.  According to Zivotofsky, Congress has used these powers to pass laws regulating the content and issuance of passports since 1856.  See Brief for Petitioner 52 (citing Act of Aug. 18, 1856, \xc2\xa723, \n\n11Stat.\n60).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tZivotofsky contends that \xc2\xa7214(d) fits squarely within this tradition.  He notes that the State Department\xe2\x80\x99s designated representative stated in her deposition for this litigation that the \xe2\x80\x9cplace of birth\xe2\x80\x9d entry is included only as \xe2\x80\x9can element of identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 76 (Deposition of Catherine Barry, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Overseas Citizens Services); see Brief for Petitioner 10.  Moreover, Zivotofsky argues, the \xe2\x80\x9cplace of birth\xe2\x80\x9d entry cannot be taken as a means for recognizing foreign sovereigns, because the State Department authorizes recording unrecognized territories\xe2\x80\x94such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank\xe2\x80\x94as places of birth.

Zivotofsky argues that the Secretary is overreading the authority granted to the President in the \xe2\x80\x9creceive Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d clause.  He observes that in the Federalist Papers, Alexander Hamilton described the power conferred by this clause as \xe2\x80\x9cmore a matter of dignity than of authority,\xe2\x80\x9d and called it \xe2\x80\x9ca circumstance, which will be without consequence in the administration of the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 69, p.\xc2\xa0468 (J.\xc2\xa0Cooke ed. 1961); see Brief for Petitioner 37.  Zivotofsky also points to other clauses in the Constitution, such as Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power to declare war, that suggest some congressional role in recognition.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 23 (citing U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa011).  He cites, for example, an 1836 message from President Jackson to Congress, acknowledging that it is unclear who holds the authority to recognize because it is a power \xe2\x80\x9cno where expressly dele- gated\xe2\x80\x9d in the Constitution, and one that is \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily involved in some of the great powers given to Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  Message from the President of the United States Upon the Subject of the Political, Military, and Civil Condition of Texas, H.\xc2\xa0R.

See Brief for Petitioner 44\xe2\x80\x9346; Reply Brief for Petitioner 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Finally, Zivotofsky contends that even if the \xe2\x80\x9creceive Ambassadors\xe2\x80\x9d clause confers some exclusive recognition power on the President, simply allowing a choice as to the \xe2\x80\x9cplace of birth\xe2\x80\x9d entry on a passport does not significantly intrude on that power.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRecitation of these arguments\xe2\x80\x94which sound in familiar principles of constitutional interpretation\xe2\x80\x94is enough to establish that this case does not \xe2\x80\x9cturn on standards that defy judicial application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Baker, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211.  Resolution of Zivotofksy\xe2\x80\x99s claim demands careful examination of the textual, structural, and historical evidence put forward by the parties regarding the nature of the statute and of the passport and recognition powers.  This is what courts do.  The political question doctrine poses no bar to judicial review of this case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo say that Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim presents issues the Judiciary is competent to resolve is not to say that reaching a decision in this case is simple.  Because the District Court and the D.\xc2\xa0C.

In particular, when we reverse on a threshold question, we typically remand for resolution of any claims the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 error prevented them from addressing.  See, e.g., Bond v.

This case does not require the Judiciary to decide whether the power to recognize foreign governments and the extent of their territory is conferred exclusively on the President or is shared with Congress.  Petitioner does not claim that the statutory provision in question represents an attempt by Congress to dictate United States policy regarding the status of Jerusalem.  Instead, petitioner contends in effect that Congress has the power to mandate that an American citizen born abroad be given the option of including in his passport and Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA) what amounts to a statement of personal belief on the status of Jerusalem.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPowers conferred on Congress by the Constitution certainly give Congress a measure of authority to prescribe the contents of passports and CRBAs.  The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce, Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa03, and this power includes the power to regulate the entry of persons into this country, see Henderson v. Mayor of New York, \n\n92 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259\n\xe2\x80\x93271 (1876).  The Constitution also gives Congress the power to make a \xe2\x80\x9cuniform Rule of Naturalization,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl.\xc2\xa04, and pursuant to this power, Congress has enacted laws concerning the citizenship of children born abroad to parents who are citizens of this country, see United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n\n169 U.\xc2\xa0S. 649, \n688 (1898)\n.  These powers allow Congress to mandate that identifying information be in- cluded in passports and CRBAs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe President also has a measure of authority concerning the contents of passports and CRBAs.

Garamendi, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396, \n414 (2003)\n, and, historically, that authority has included the power to issue passports, even in the absence of any formal congressional conferral of authority to do so.  See Haig v. Agee, \n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280, \n293 (1981)\n (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rior to 1856, when there was no statute on the subject, the common perception was that the issuance of a passport was committed to the sole discretion of the Executive and that the Executive would exercise this power in the interests of the national security and foreign policy of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have described a passport as \xe2\x80\x9ca letter of introduction in which the issuing sovereign vouches for the bearer and requests other sovereigns to aid the bearer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 292.

I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that this case does not present a political question.  I write separately, however, because I understand the inquiry required by the political question doctrine to be more demanding than that suggested by the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe political question doctrine speaks to an amalgam of circumstances in which courts properly examine whether a particular suit is justiciable\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the dispute is appropriate for resolution by courts.  The doctrine is \xe2\x80\x9cessentially a function of the separation of powers,\xe2\x80\x9d Baker v. Carr, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186, \n217 (1962)\n, which recognizes the limits that Article III imposes upon courts and accords appropriate respect to the other branches\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of their own constitutional powers.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Baker, this Court identified six circumstances in which an issue might present a political question: (1) \xe2\x80\x9ca textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it\xe2\x80\x9d; (3) \xe2\x80\x9cthe impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion\xe2\x80\x9d; (4) \xe2\x80\x9cthe impossibility of a court\xe2\x80\x99s undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government\xe2\x80\x9d; (5) \xe2\x80\x9can unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made\xe2\x80\x9d; or (6) \xe2\x80\x9cthe potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 217.  Baker established that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless one of these formulations is inextricable from the case at bar, there should be no dismissal for nonjusticiability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But Baker left unanswered when the presence of one or more factors warrants dismissal, as well as the interrelationship of the six factors and the relative importance of each in determining whether a case is suitable for adjudication.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, the Baker factors reflect three distinct justifications for withholding judgment on the merits of a dispute.  When a case would require a court to decide an issue whose resolution is textually committed to a coordinate political department, as envisioned by Baker\xe2\x80\x99s first factor, abstention is warranted because the court lacks authority to resolve that issue.  See, e.g., Nixon v. United States, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224, \n229 (1993)\n (holding nonjusticiable the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s impeachment procedures in light of Article I\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to the Senate of the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98sole Power to try all Impeachments\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 165\xe2\x80\x93166 (1803) (\xe2\x80\x9cBy the constitution of the United States, the president is invested with certain important political powers, in the exercise of which he is to use his own discretion, and is accountable only to his country in his political character, and to his own conscience\xe2\x80\x9d).  In such cases, the Constitution itself requires that another branch resolve the question presented.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe second and third Baker factors reflect circum- stances in which a dispute calls for decisionmaking beyond courts\xe2\x80\x99 competence.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The judicial Power\xe2\x80\x99 created by Article III, \xc2\xa71, of the Constitution is not whatever judges choose to do,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather the power \xe2\x80\x9cto act in the manner traditional for English and American courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vieth v. Jubelirer, \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 267, \n278 (2004)\n (plurality opinion).  That traditional role involves the application of some manageable and cognizable standard within the competence of the Judiciary to ascertain and employ to the facts of a concrete case.  When a court is given no standard by which to adjudicate a dispute, or cannot resolve a dispute in the absence of a yet-unmade policy determination charged to a political branch, resolution of the suit is be- yond the judicial role envisioned by Article III.  See, e.g., Gilligan v. Morgan, \n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n10 (1973)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is difficult to conceive of an area of governmental activity in which the courts have less competence\xe2\x80\x9d than \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he complex, subtle, and professional decisions as to the composition, training, equipping, and control of a military force\xe2\x80\x9d); Vieth, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 278 (\xe2\x80\x9cOne of the most obvious limitations imposed by [Article III] is that judicial action must be governed by standard . . . \xe2\x80\x9d).  This is not to say, of course, that courts are incapable of interpreting or applying somewhat ambiguous standards using familiar tools of statutory or constitutional interpretation.  But where an issue leaves courts truly rudderless, there can be \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt of [the] validity\xe2\x80\x9d of a court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to abstain from judgment.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe final three Baker factors address circumstances in which prudence may counsel against a court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of an issue presented.  Courts should be particularly cautious before forgoing adjudication of a dispute on the basis that judicial intervention risks \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question,\xe2\x80\x9d would express a \xe2\x80\x9clack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,\xe2\x80\x9d or because there exists an \xe2\x80\x9cunusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made.\xe2\x80\x9d  369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 217.  We have repeatedly rejected the view that these thresholds are met whenever a court is called upon to resolve the constitutionality or propriety of the act of another branch of Government.  See, e.g., United States v. Munoz-Flores, \n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385\n\xe2\x80\x93391 (1990); Powell v. McCormack, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 486, \n548, \n549 (1969)\n.  A court may not refuse to adjudicate a dispute merely because a decision \xe2\x80\x9cmay have significant political overtones\xe2\x80\x9d or affect \xe2\x80\x9cthe conduct of this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s foreign relations,\xe2\x80\x9d Japan Whaling Assn. v. American Cetacean Soc., \n\n478 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221, \n230 (1986)\n.  Nor may courts decline to resolve a controversy within their traditional competence and proper jurisdiction simply because the question is difficult, the consequences weighty, or the potential real for conflict with the policy preferences of the political branches.  The exercise of such authority is among the \xe2\x80\x9cgravest and most delicate dut[ies] that this Court is called on to perform,\xe2\x80\x9d Blodgett v. Holden, \n\n275 U.\xc2\xa0S. 142, \n148 (1927)\n (Holmes, J., concurring), but it is the role assigned to courts by the Constitution.  \xe2\x80\x9cQuestions may occur which we would gladly avoid; but we cannot avoid them.  All we can do is, to exercise our best judgment, and conscientiously to perform our duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cohens v. Virginia, 6 Wheat. 264, 404 (1821).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRare occasions implicating Baker\xe2\x80\x99s final factors, how- ever, may present an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unusual case\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d unfit for judicial disposition.  369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218 (quoting the argument of Daniel Webster in Luther v. Borden, 7 How. 1, 29 (1849)).  Because of the respect due to a coequal and independent department, for instance, courts properly resist calls to question the good faith with which another branch attests to the authenticity of its internal acts.  See, e.g., Field v. Clark, \n\n143 U.\xc2\xa0S. 649\n\xe2\x80\x93673 (1892) (deeming \xe2\x80\x9cforbidden by the respect due to a coordinate branch of the government\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial action\xe2\x80\x9d requiring a belief in a \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate conspiracy\xe2\x80\x9d by the Senate and House of Representatives \xe2\x80\x9cto defeat an expression of the popular will\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Munoz-Flores, 495 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 409\xe2\x80\x93410 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cMutual regard between the coordinate branches, and the interest of certainty, both demand that official representations regarding .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. matters of internal process be accepted at face value\xe2\x80\x9d).  Likewise, we have long acknowledged that courts are particularly ill suited to intervening in exigent disputes necessitating unusual need for \xe2\x80\x9cattributing finality to the action of the political departments,\xe2\x80\x9d Coleman v. Miller, \n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433, \n454 (1939)\n, or creating acute \xe2\x80\x9crisk [of] embarrassment of our government abroad, or grave disturbance at home,\xe2\x80\x9d Baker, 369 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 226.

If the judicial power extends so far, the guarantee contained in the Constitution of the United States is a guarantee of anarchy, and not of order\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Finally, it may be appropriate for courts to stay their hand in cases implicating delicate questions concerning the distribution of political authority between coordinate branches until a dispute is ripe, intractable, and incapable of resolution by the political process.  See Goldwater v. Carter, \n\n444 U.\xc2\xa0S. 996, \n997 (1979)\n (Powell, J., concurring in judgment).  Abstention merely reflects that judicial intervention in such cases is \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate only in the last resort,\xe2\x80\x9d Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk R.\xc2\xa0Co. v. Wellman, \n\n143 U.\xc2\xa0S. 339, \n345 (1892)\n, and is disfavored relative to the prospect of accommodation between the political branches.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen such unusual cases arise, abstention accommodates considerations inherent in the separation of powers and the limitations envisioned by Article III, which conferred authority to federal courts against a common-law backdrop that recognized the propriety of abstention in exceptional cases.  New Orleans Public Service, Inc. v. Council of City of New Orleans, \n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 350, \n359 (1989)\n; see generally Shapiro, Jurisdiction and Discretion, 60 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 543 (1985) (hereinafter Shapiro).  The political questions envisioned by Baker\xe2\x80\x99s final categories find common ground, therefore, with many longstanding doctrines under which considerations of justiciability or comity lead courts to abstain from deciding questions whose initial resolution is better suited to another time, see, e.g., National Park Hospitality Assn. v.

Largely for the reasons set out by the Court, I agree that the Court of Appeals misapprehended the nature of its task.  In two respects, however, my understanding of the political question doctrine might require a court to engage in further analysis beyond that relied upon by the Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the Court appropriately recognizes that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim to a statutory right is \xe2\x80\x9crelevant\xe2\x80\x9d to the justiciability inquiry required in this case.  Ante, at 6.  In order to evaluate whether a case presents a political question, a court must first identify with precision the issue it is being asked to decide.  Here, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s suit claims that a federal statute provides him with a right to have \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d listed as his place of birth on his passport and other re- lated documents.  App. 15\xe2\x80\x9318.  To decide that question, a court must determine whether the statute is constitu- tional, and therefore mandates the Secretary of State to issue petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s desired passport, or unconstitutional, in which case his suit is at an end.  Resolution of that issue is not one \xe2\x80\x9ctextually committed\xe2\x80\x9d to another branch; to the contrary, it is committed to this one.  In no fashion does the question require a court to review the wisdom of the President\xe2\x80\x99s policy toward Jerusalem or any other decision committed to the discretion of a coordinate department.  For that reason, I agree that the decision below should be reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat is not to say, however, that no statute could give rise to a political question.  It is not impossible to imagine a case involving the application or even the constitutionality of an enactment that would present a nonjusticiable issue.  Indeed, this Court refused to determine whether an Ohio state constitutional provision offended the Repub- lican Guarantee Clause, Art.\xc2\xa0IV, \xc2\xa74, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe question of whether that guarantee of the Constitution has been disregarded presents no justiciable controversy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio ex\xc2\xa0rel. Davis v. Hildebrant, \n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 565, \n569 (1916)\n.  A similar result would follow if Congress passed a statute, for instance, purporting to award financial relief to those improperly \xe2\x80\x9ctried\xe2\x80\x9d of impeachment offenses.  To adjudicate claims under such a statute would require a court to resolve the very same issue we found nonjusticiable in Nixon.  Such examples are atypical, but they suffice to show that the foreclosure altogether of political question analysis in statutory cases is unwarranted.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Court suggests that this case does not implicate the political question doctrine\xe2\x80\x99s concern with issues exhibiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 8, because the parties\xe2\x80\x99 arguments rely on textual, structural, and historical evidence of the kind that courts routinely consider.  But that was equally true in Nixon, a case in which we found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe use of the word \xe2\x80\x98try\xe2\x80\x99 in the first sentence of the Impeachment Trial Clause lacks sufficient precision to afford any judicially manageable standard of review of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 230.  We reached that conclusion even though the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs focused upon the text of the Impeachment Trial Clause, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s drafting history,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccontemporaneous commentary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cthe unbroken practice of the Senate for 150 years,\xe2\x80\x9d contemporary dictionary meanings, \xe2\x80\x9cHamilton\xe2\x80\x99s Federalist essays,\xe2\x80\x9d and the practice in the House of Lords prior to ratification.  Such evidence was no more or less unfamiliar to courts than that on which the parties rely here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn my view, it is not whether the evidence upon which litigants rely is common to judicial consideration that determines whether a case lacks judicially discoverable and manageable standards.  Rather, it is whether that evidence in fact provides a court a basis to adjudicate meaningfully the issue with which it is presented.  The answer will almost always be yes, but if the parties\xe2\x80\x99 tex- tual, structural, and historical evidence is inapposite or wholly unilluminating, rendering judicial decision no more than guesswork, a case relying on the ordinary kinds of arguments offered to courts might well still present justiciability concerns.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, however, the Court of Appeals majority found a political question solely on the basis that this case required resolution of an issue \xe2\x80\x9ctextually committed\xe2\x80\x9d to the Executive Branch.

As she points out, Baker v. Carr, \n\n369 U.\xc2\xa0S. 186 (1962)\n, set forth several categories of legal questions that the Court had previously held to be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical questions\xe2\x80\x9d inappropriate for judicial determination.  Those categories include (1) instances in which the Constitution clearly commits decisionmaking power to another branch of Government, and (2) issues lacking judicially manageable standards for resolution.  Id., at 217.  They also include (3) issues that courts cannot decide without making \xe2\x80\x9can initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion,\xe2\x80\x9d (4) issues that a court cannot independently decide \xe2\x80\x9cwithout expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government,\xe2\x80\x9d (5) cases in which there is \xe2\x80\x9can unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made,\xe2\x80\x9d and (6) cases in which there is a potential for \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs Justice Sotomayor also points out, these categories (and in my view particularly the last four) embody \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances in which prudence may counsel against a court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of an issue presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see Nixon v. United States, \n\n506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224, \n253 (1993)\n (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (the political-question doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cderiv[es] in large part from prudential concerns about the respect we owe the political departments\xe2\x80\x9d); Goldwater v.

L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1265, 1304 (1961) (prudence counsels hesitation where a legal issue is \xe2\x80\x9cfelt to be so closely related to a complex of decisions not within the court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction that its resolution by the court would either be poor in itself or would jeopardize sound decisions in the larger complex\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Sotomayor adds that the circumstances in which these prudential considerations lead the Court not to decide a case otherwise properly before it are rare.  Ante, at 7.  I agree.  But in my view we nonetheless have before us such a case.  Four sets of prudential considerations, taken together, lead me to that conclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, the issue before us arises in the field of foreign affairs.  (Indeed, the statutory provision before us is a subsection of a section that concerns the relation between Jerusalem and the State of Israel.  See \xc2\xa7214 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003, \n\n116Stat.\n1365 (\xe2\x80\x9cUnited States Policy with Respect to Jerusalem as the Capital of Israel\xe2\x80\x9d).)  The Constitution primarily delegates the foreign affairs powers \xe2\x80\x9cto the political departments of the government, Executive and Legislative,\xe2\x80\x9d not to the Judiciary.  Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, Inc. v. Waterman S. S. Corp., \n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, \n111 (1948)\n; see also Marbury v. Madison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803) (noting discretionary foreign affairs functions of Secretary of State as beyond the power of the Judiciary to review).  And that fact is not surprising.  Decisionmaking in this area typically is highly political.  It is \xe2\x80\x9cdelicate\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccomplex.\xe2\x80\x9d  Chicago &amp; Southern Air Lines, 333 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 111.  It often rests upon information readily available to the Executive Branch and to the intelligence committees of Congress, but not readily available to the courts.  Ibid.  It frequently is highly dependent upon what Justice Jackson called \xe2\x80\x9cprophecy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  And the creation of wise foreign policy typically lies well beyond the experience or professional capacity of a judge.  Ibid.  At the same time, where foreign affairs is at issue, the practical need for the United States to speak \xe2\x80\x9cwith one voice and ac[t] as one,\xe2\x80\x9d is particularly important.  See United States v. Pink, \n\n315 U.\xc2\xa0S. 203, \n242 (1942)\n (Frankfurter, J., concurring); see also R. Fallon, J.\xc2\xa0Manning, D. Meltzer, &amp; D. Shapiro, Hart and Wechsler\xe2\x80\x99s The Federal Courts and the Federal System 240 (6th ed. 2009).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe result is a judicial hesitancy to make decisions that have significant foreign policy implications, as reflected in the fact that many of the cases in which the Court has in- voked the political-question doctrine have arisen in this area, e.g., cases in which the validity of a treaty depended upon the partner state\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority, Doe v. Braden, 16 How. 635, 657 (1854), or upon its continuing existence, Terlinden v. Ames, \n\n184 U.\xc2\xa0S. 270, \n285 (1902)\n; cases concerning the existence of foreign states, governments, belligerents, and insurgents, Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., \n\n246 U.\xc2\xa0S. 297, \n302 (1918)\n; United States v. Klintock, 5 Wheat. 144, 149 (1820); United States v. Pal- mer, 3 Wheat. 610, 634\xe2\x80\x93635 (1818); and cases concerning the territorial boundaries of foreign states, Williams v. Suffolk Ins. Co., 13 Pet. 415, 420 (1839); Foster v. Neilson, 2 Pet. 253, 307 (1829).  See Baker, supra, at 186, 211\xe2\x80\x93213 (citing these cases as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s principal foreign-relations political-question cases); see also Fallon, supra, at 243\xe2\x80\x93247.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, if the courts must answer the constitutional question before us, they may well have to evaluate the foreign policy implications of foreign policy decisions.  The constitutional question focuses upon a statutory provision, \xc2\xa7214(d), that says: The Secretary of State, upon the request of a U.\xc2\xa0S. citizen born in Jerusalem (or upon the request of the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s legal guardian), shall \xe2\x80\x9crecord\xe2\x80\x9d in the citizen\xe2\x80\x99s passport or consular birth report \xe2\x80\x9cthe place of birth as Israel.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n116Stat.\n1366.  And the question is whether this statute unconstitutionally seeks to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s inherent constitutional authority to make cer- tain kinds of foreign policy decisions.  See American Ins. Assn. v. Garamendi, \n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 396\n\xe2\x80\x93415 (2003) (citing cases); Clinton v. City of New York, \n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 417, \n445 (1998)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court has recognized that in the foreign affairs arena, the President has \xe2\x80\x98a degree of discretion and freedom from statutory restriction which would not be admissible were domestic affairs alone involved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corp., \n\n299 U.\xc2\xa0S. 304, \n320 (1936)\n)); cf. Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer, \n\n343 U.\xc2\xa0S. 579\n\xe2\x80\x93638 (1952) (Jackson, J., concurring).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Secretary of State argues that the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority to determine foreign policy includes the power to recognize foreign governments, that this Court has long recognized that the latter power belongs to the President exclusively, that the power includes the power to determine claims over disputed territory as well as the policy governing recognition decisions, and that the statute unconstitutionally limits the President\xe2\x80\x99s exclusive authority to exercise these powers.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art. II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02; Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73; e.g., Kennett v. Chambers, 14 How. 38, 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (1852) (recognition); Williams, supra, at 420 (disputed territory); Pink, supra, at 229 (recognition policy); see also Haig v. Agee, \n\n453 U.\xc2\xa0S. 280, \n293 (1981)\n (executive passport authority).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tZivotofsky, supported by several Members of Congress, points out that the Constitution also grants Congress powers related to foreign affairs, such as the powers to declare war, to regulate foreign commerce, and to regulate naturalization.  See Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cls.\xc2\xa03, 4, 11; see also American Ins. Assn., supra, at 414.  They add that Congress may share some of the recognition power and its attendant power of determining claims over disputed territory.  E.g., Palmer, supra, at 634 (recognition); Jones v. United States, \n\n137 U.\xc2\xa0S. 202, \n212 (1890)\n (disputed territory).  And they add that Congress may enact laws concerning travel into this country and concerning the citizenship of children born abroad to U.\xc2\xa0S. citizens.  See Henderson v. Mayor of New York, \n\n92 U.\xc2\xa0S. 259\n\xe2\x80\x93271 (1876) (travel); Fong Yue Ting v. United States, \n\n149 U.\xc2\xa0S. 698, \n714 (1893)\n (immigration); United States v. Wong Kim Ark, \n\n169 U.\xc2\xa0S. 649, \n688 (1898)\n (citizenship).  They argue that these powers include the power to specify the content of a passport (or consular birth report).  And when such a specification takes the form of statutory law, they say, the Constitution requires the President (through the Secretary of State) to execute that statute.  See Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa73. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWere the statutory provision undisputedly concerned only with purely administrative matters (or were its enforcement undisputedly to involve only major foreign policy matters), judicial efforts to answer the constitu- tional question might not involve judges in trying to answer questions of foreign policy.  But in the Middle East, administrative matters can have implications that extend far beyond the purely administrative.  Political reactions in that region can prove uncertain.  And in that context it may well turn out that resolution of the constitutional argument will require a court to decide how far the statute, in practice, reaches beyond the purely administrative, determining not only whether but also the extent to which enforcement will interfere with the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to make significant recognition-related foreign policy decisions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCertainly the parties argue as if that were so.  Zivotofsky, for example, argues that replacing \xe2\x80\x9cJerusalem\xe2\x80\x9d on his passport with \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d will have no serious foreign policy significance.  See Brief for Petitioner 43, 46\xe2\x80\x9352; Reply Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  And in support he points to (1) a State Department official\xe2\x80\x99s statement that birthplace designation serves primarily as \xe2\x80\x9can element of identification,\xe2\x80\x9d while omitting mention of recognition; (2) the fact that the State Department has recorded births in unrecognized territories in the region, such as the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, apparently without adverse effect; and (3) the fact that sometimes Jerusalem does (because of what the Government calls \xe2\x80\x9cclerical errors\xe2\x80\x9d) carry with it the name of \xe2\x80\x9cIsrael\xe2\x80\x9d on certain official documents, again apparently without seriously adverse effect.  See Brief for Petitioner 7\xe2\x80\x9310, 15, 43, 50; App. 50, 58\xe2\x80\x9360, 75\xe2\x80\x9376.  Moreover, Zivotofsky says, it is unfair to allow the 100,000 or so Americans born in cities that the United States recognizes as under Israeli sovereignty, such as Tel Aviv or Haifa, the right to a record that mentions Israel, while denying that privilege to the 50,000 or so Americans born in Jerusalem.  See Brief for Petitioner 18\xe2\x80\x9320, 48\xe2\x80\x9349; App. 48.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt the same time, the Secretary argues that listing Israel on the passports (and consular birth reports) of Americans born in Jerusalem will have significantly adverse foreign policy effects.  See Brief for Respondent 8, 37\xe2\x80\x9341.  She says that doing so would represent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an official decision by the United States to begin to treat Jerusalem as a city located within Israel,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 38\xe2\x80\x9339, that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould be interpreted as an official act of recognizing Jerusalem as being under Israeli sovereignty,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 56, and that our \xe2\x80\x9cnational security interests\xe2\x80\x9d consequently \xe2\x80\x9cwould be significantly harmed,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 49.  Such an action, she says, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would signal, symbolically or concretely, that\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the United States \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98recognizes that Jerusalem is a city that is located within the sovereign territory of Is- rael,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and doing so, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98would critically compromise the ability of the United States to work with Israelis, Palestinians and others in the region to further the peace process.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 2; App. 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  She adds that the very enactment of this statutory provision in 2002 produced headlines in the Middle East stating the \xe2\x80\x9cthe U.\xc2\xa0S. now recognizes Jerusalem as Israel\xe2\x80\x99s capital.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 231; Brief for Respondent 10; see also App. 53\xe2\x80\x9355, 227\xe2\x80\x93231.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to evaluate opposing claims of this kind is minimal.  At the same time, a judicial effort to do so risks inadvertently jeopardizing sound foreign policy decisionmaking by the other branches of Government.  How, for example, is this Court to determine whether, or the extent to which, the continuation of the adjudication that it now orders will itself have a foreign policy effect?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, the countervailing interests in obtaining judicial resolution of the constitutional determination are not particularly strong ones.  Zivotofsky does not assert the kind of interest, e.g., an interest in property or bodily integrity, which courts have traditionally sought to protect.  See, e.g., Ingraham v. Wright, \n\n430 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651\n\xe2\x80\x93674 (1977) (enduring commitment to legal protection of bodily integrity).  Nor, importantly, does he assert an interest in vindicating a basic right of the kind that the Constitution grants to individuals and that courts traditionally have protected from invasion by the other branches of Government.  And I emphasize this fact because the need for judicial action in such cases can trump the foreign policy concerns that I have mentioned.  As Professor Jaffe pointed out many years ago, \xe2\x80\x9cOur courts would not refuse to entertain habeas corpus to test the constitutionality of the imprisonment of an alleged Chinese agent even if it were clear that his imprisonment was closely bound up with our relations to the Chinese government.\xe2\x80\x9d  74 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 1304; see also T. Franck, Political Questions/ Judicial Answers 63\xe2\x80\x9364 (1992); cf. Boumediene v. Bush, \n\n553 U.\xc2\xa0S. 723, \n755 (2008)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe interest that Zivotofsky asserts, however, is akin to an ideological interest.  See Brief for Petitioner 54 (citizen born in Jerusalem, unlike citizen born in Tel Aviv or Haifa, does not have the \xe2\x80\x9coption\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cspecify or suppress the name of a country that accords with his or her ideology\xe2\x80\x9d); see also id., at 19 (State Department policy bars citizens born in Jerusalem \xe2\x80\x9cfrom identifying their birthplace in a manner that conforms with their convictions\xe2\x80\x9d).  And insofar as an individual suffers an injury that is purely ideological, courts have often refused to consider the matter, leaving the injured party to look to the political branches for protection.  E.g., Diamond v. Charles, \n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 54\n\xe2\x80\x9367 (1986); Sierra Club v. Morton, \n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 727\n\xe2\x80\x93740 (1972).  This is not to say that Zivotofsky\xe2\x80\x99s claim is unimportant or that the injury is not serious or even that it is purely ideological.  It is to point out that those suffering somewhat similar harms have sometimes had to look to the political branches for resolution of relevant legal issues.  Cf. United States v. Richardson, \n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 166, \n179 (1974)\n; Laird v. Tatum, \n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n15 (1972)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, insofar as the controversy reflects different foreign policy views among the political branches of Government, those branches have nonjudicial methods of working out their differences.  Cf. Goldwater, 444 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 1002, 1004 (Rehnquist, J., joined by Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Stewart and Stevens, JJ., concurring in judgment) (finding in similar fact strong reason for Judiciary not to decide treaty power question).  The Executive and Legislative Branches frequently work out disagreements through ongoing contacts and relationships, involving, for example, budget authorizations, confirmation of personnel, committee hearings, and a host of more informal contacts, which, taken together, ensure that, in practice, Members of Congress as well as the President play an important role in the shaping of foreign policy.  Indeed, both the Legislative Branch and the Executive Branch typically understand the need to work each with the other in order to create effective foreign policy.  In that understanding, those related contacts, and the continuous foreign policy-related relationship lies the possibility of working out the kind of disagreement we see before us.  Moreover, if application of the political-question \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine ultimately turns, as Learned Hand put it, on \xe2\x80\x98how importunately the occasion demands an answer,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Nixon, 506 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 253 (Souter, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting L. Hand, The Bill of Rights 15 (1958)), the ability of the political branches to work out their differences minimizes the need for judicial intervention here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe upshot is that this case is unusual both in its minimal need for judicial intervention and in its more serious risk that intervention will bring about \xe2\x80\x9cembarrassment,\xe2\x80\x9d show lack of \xe2\x80\x9crespect\xe2\x80\x9d for the other branches, and potentially disrupt sound foreign policy decisionmaking.  For these prudential reasons, I would hold that the political-question doctrine bars further judicial consideration of this case.  And I would affirm the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 similar conclusion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith respect, I dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
