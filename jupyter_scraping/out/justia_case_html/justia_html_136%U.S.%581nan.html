United States, 136 U.S.  581 (1890)</h3><p><b>Mason v. United States</b></p><p><b>No. 214</b></p><p><b>Submitted May 5, 1890</b></p><p><b>Decided May 19, 1890</b></p><p><b>136 U.S. 581</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>A postmaster and the sureties on his official bond being sued jointly for a breach of the bond, he and a part of the sureties appeared and defended; the suit was abated as to one of the sureties who had died, and the other sureties made default, and judgment of default was entered against them.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="582">Page 136 U. S. 582</a></p><p> On the trial, a verdict was returned for the plaintiff, whereupon judgment was entered against the principal and all the sureties for the amount of the verdict.  The sureties who had appeared sued out a writ of error to this judgment without joining the principal or the sureties who had made default.  The plaintiff in error moved to amend the writ of error by adding the omitted parties as plaintiffs in error or for a severance of those parties.  <em>Held</em> that the motion must be denied.</p>\n<p>This was an action against the postmaster of Chicago and the sureties upon his official bond, the alleged breach being that he had not accounted to the United States for large sums of money received by him from the sale of postage stamps and other sources connected with the postal service.  The principal defense was that the moneys had been deposited in a bank which had failed, and which was a designated depositary of public moneys.  The process was against the postmaster and seven of the sureties jointly.  Two of the sureties died before</p>\n<p>trial, and the suit was abated as to them.  Two appeared, and, together with the postmaster, went to trial in defense.  The default of the remaining three sureties was taken before proceeding to trial.  The jury assessed the damages at $116,559.14, and judgment was entered therein against all the remaining parties impleaded, (the postmaster and five sureties), "and that the United States have execution thereof."  To this judgment two of the sureties sued out a writ of error, without joining the other parties or summons and severance.</p>\n<p>The case was reached on the docket on the 19th of March, 1890.  The counsel for plaintiffs in error commenced the opening of the case, but the court, upon examination of the record, declined to hear further argument for the present, and ordered the case to be passed.</p>\n<p>On the 5th of May, 1890, the counsel for the plaintiffs in error made the following motion:</p>\n<p>"And now comes Carlisle Mason John Alston, John McArthur, James Steele, Thomas S. bobbins and Solomon McKichan, who, jointly, and severally, move for leave to amend the writ of error by inserting therein their names, they being all of the defendants in the judgment rendered by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="583">Page 136 U.

That he procured the writ of error which now appears in the record from the clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Northern District of Illinois, supposing that the cause would be brought to this Court for review of the alleged errors in the court below, the same as if said writ of error had named all of the defendants in said judgment, and that if the same should be reversed, that it would be reversed as to all, that being the practice in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="585">Page 136 U.

Deponent further says that he had authority to have used the names of John McArthur, John Alston, Carlisle Mason James Steele and Thomas S. bobbins in the prosecution of a writ of error, and that as he understands it, he had the right to use the name of Solomon McKichan in connection with the other defendants, according to the rules of law, but the deponent further says that he now perceives that said writ of error is defective in describing the suit as one between the United States of America, plaintiff, and Carlisle Mason John Alston and others, defendants, when the writ should have named all of the defendants in the judgment for the purpose of correctly describing the suit, and that the same error exists in the citation, and the suit should have been docketed in this Court in the names of all of the defendants in said judgment."</p>\n<p>"The deponent further says that he has procured the signatures of John McArthur, James Steele and Solomon McKichan to a paper attached hereto entering their appearance and consent to such proceedings as may be necessary to enable the court to determine the errors assigned, and that he could have procured the personal signature of Thomas S. Dobbins, the remaining defendant, except for the reason of his absence from Chicago, his place of residence, in Colorado at some point which deponent has been unable to ascertain in time to procure the signature during the present term, and for that reason he has exercised the authority which he has as attorney by signing the name of said Thomas S. Dobbins to said paper.  And deponent further says that he has been fully authorized to sign all the said names except that of Solomon McKichan, as attorney, without obtaining their consent at the present time, but that he preferred having them append their signatures in person to such consent and has done so as far as possible at the present time."</p>\n<p>"WILLIAM C.
