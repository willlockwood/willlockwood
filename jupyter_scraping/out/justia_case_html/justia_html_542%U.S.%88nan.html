WINN<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">HIBBS, DIRECTOR, ARIZONA DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE <em>v.</em> WINN et al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 02\xe2\x80\x931809. Argued January 20, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 14, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Plaintiffs-respondents, Arizona taxpayers, filed suit in federal court against the Director of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Revenue (Director) seeking to enjoin the operation of Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 on Establishment Clause grounds.  Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s law authorizes an income-tax credit for payments to nonprofit \xe2\x80\x9cschool tuition organizations\xe2\x80\x9d (STOs) that award scholarships to students in private elementary or secondary schools.  Section 43\xe2\x80\x931089 provides that STOs may not designate schools that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status or national origin,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(F), but does not preclude STOs from designating schools that provide religious instruction or give religion-based admissions preferences.  The District Court granted the Director\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss on the ground that the Tax Injunction Act (TIA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, barred the suit.  The TIA prohibits lower federal courts from restraining \xe2\x80\x9cthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law where a plain, speedy and efficient remedy may be had in the courts of such State.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the TIA does not bar federal-court actions challenging state tax credits.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held: </em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0 The Court rejects respondents\xe2\x80\x99 contention that the Director\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition was jurisdictionally untimely under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72101(c) and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 13(3).  Section 2101(c) instructs that a petition must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin ninety days after the entry of \xe2\x80\xa6 judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 13(3) elaborates on that statute\xe2\x80\x99s instruction.  More than 90 days elapsed between the date the Ninth Circuit first entered judgment and the date the Director\xe2\x80\x99s petition was filed.  That time lapse, respondents assert, made the filing untimely under Rule 13(3)\xe2\x80\x99s first sentence: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he time to file \xe2\x80\xa6 runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, respondents submit, because no party petitioned for rehearing, the extended filing periods prescribed by the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence never came into play.  This case, however, did not follow the typical course.  The Ninth Circuit, on its own initiative, had recalled its mandate and ordered the parties to brief the question whether the case should be reheard en banc.  That order, this Court holds, suspended the judgment\xe2\x80\x99s finality under \xc2\xa72101(c), just as a timely filed rehearing petition would or a court\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate decision to consider a late-filed rehearing petition, see Missouri</em> v. <em>Jenkins,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/33/index.html">495 U. S. 33</a>, 49.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 order raised the question whether that court would modify the judgment and alter the parties\xe2\x80\x99 rights; thus, while the court-initiated briefing order was pending, there was no \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment\xe2\x80\x9d to be reviewed.  See, <em>e.g., id.</em>, at 46.  The Director\xe2\x80\x99s certiorari petition was timely under the statute because it was filed within 90 days of the date the Ninth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  Were this Court to read Rule 13 as the sole guide, so that only a party\xe2\x80\x99s rehearing petition could reset the statute\xe2\x80\x99s 90-day count, the Court would lose sight of the congressional objective underpinning \xc2\xa72101(c): An appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s final adjudication, Congress indicated, marks the time from which the filing period begins to run.  The statute takes priority over the \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schacht</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/58/index.html">398 U. S. 58</a>, 64.  Because the petition was timely under \xc2\xa72101(c), the Court has jurisdiction.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The TIA does not bar respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0To determine whether the TIA bars this litigation, it is appropriate, first, to identify the relief sought.  Respondents seek prospective relief only: injunctive relief prohibiting the Director from allowing taxpayers to utilize the \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 tax credit for payments to STOs that make religion-based tuition grants; a declaration that \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089, on its face and as applied, violates the Establishment Clause; and an order that the Director inform such STOs that all funds in their possession as of the order\xe2\x80\x99s date must be paid into the state general fund.  Taking account of the prospective nature of the relief requested, the Court reaches the dispositive question whether respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit seeks to \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71341.  The answer turns on the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d as employed in the TIA.  For Internal Revenue Code (IRC) purposes, an assessment involves a \xe2\x80\x9crecording\xe2\x80\x9d of the amount the taxpayer owes the Government.  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76203.  The Court does not focus on the word \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d in isolation, however, but follows \xe2\x80\x9cthe cardinal rule that statutory language must be read in context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc.</em> v. <em>Cline,</em> 540 U. S. ___, ___.  In the TIA and tax law generally, an assessment is closely tied to the collection of a tax, <em>i.e.</em>, the assessment is the official recording of liability that triggers levy and collection efforts.  Complementing the cardinal rule just stated, the rule against superfluities instructs courts to interpret a statute to effectuate all its provisions, so that no part is rendered superfluous.  If, as the Director asserts, the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessment,\xe2\x80\x9d by itself, signified the entire taxing plan, the TIA would not need the words \xe2\x80\x9clevy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccollection\xe2\x80\x9d; the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessment,\xe2\x80\x9d alone, would do all the necessary work.  In briefing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Galletti,</em> 541 U. S. ___, the Government made clear that, under the IRC definition, an \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d serves as the trigger for levy and collection efforts.  The Government did not describe \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d as synonymous with the entire taxation plan, nor disassociate the word from the company (\xe2\x80\x9clevy or collection\xe2\x80\x9d) it keeps.  Instead, and in accord with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding, the Government related \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d to the term\xe2\x80\x99s collection-propelling function.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Congress modeled \xc2\xa71341 on earlier federal statutes of similar import, which in turn paralleled state provisions proscribing state-court actions to enjoin the collection of state and local taxes.  Congress drew particularly on the Anti-Injunction Act (AIA), which bars \xe2\x80\x9cany court\xe2\x80\x9d from entertaining a suit brought \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purpose of restraining the assessment or collection of any [federal] tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  This Court has recognized, from the AIA\xe2\x80\x99s text, that the measure serves twin purposes: It responds to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s need to assess and collect taxes expeditiously with a minimum of preenforcement judicial interference; and it requires that the legal right to disputed sums be determined in a refund suit.  <em>E.g.,</em> <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>Simon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/index.html">416 U. S. 725</a>, 736.  Lower federal courts have similarly comprehended \xc2\xa77421(a).  Just as the AIA shields federal tax collections from federal-court injunctions, so the TIA shields state tax collections from federal-court restraints.  In both 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a) and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, Congress directed taxpayers to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain collections.  Third-party suits not seeking to stop the collection (or contest the validity) of a tax <em>imposed on plaintiffs</em> were outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purview.  The TIA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history shows that, in enacting the statute, Congress focused on taxpayers who sought to avoid paying their state tax bill by pursuing a challenge route other than the one specified by the taxing authority.   Nowhere does the history announce a sweeping congressional direction to prevent federal-court interference with all aspects of state tax administration.  The foregoing understanding of the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes and legislative history underpins this Court\xe2\x80\x99s previous applications of that statute.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>California</em> v. <em>Grace Brethren Church,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/393/index.html">457 U. S. 393</a>, 408\xe2\x80\x93409.  <em>Id.,</em> at 410, distinguished.  Contrary to the Director\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, <em>Arkansas</em> v. <em>Farm Credit Servs. of Central Ark.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/821/index.html">520 U. S. 821</a>; <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc.</em> v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/582/index.html">515 U. S. 582</a>; <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a>; and <em>Rosewell</em> v. <em>LaSalle Nat. Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/index.html">450 U. S. 503</a>, do not hold that state tax administration matters must be kept entirely free from lower federal-court \xe2\x80\x9cinterference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Like <em>Grace Brethren Church</em>, all of those cases fall within \xc2\xa71341\xe2\x80\x99s undisputed compass: All involved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes (or to gain a refund of such taxes).  Federal-court relief, therefore, would have operated to reduce the flow of state tax revenue.  Those decisions are not fairly portrayed cut loose from their secure, state-revenue-protective moorings.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Grace Brethren Church</em>, 457 U. S., at 410.  This Court has interpreted and applied the TIA only in cases Congress wrote the statute to address, <em>i.e.,</em> cases in which state taxpayers seek federal-court orders enabling them to avoid paying state taxes.  The Court has read harmoniously the \xc2\xa71341 instruction conditioning the jurisdictional bar on the availability of \xe2\x80\x9ca plain, speedy and efficient remedy\xe2\x80\x9d in state court.  The remedy inspected in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions was not designed for the universe of plaintiffs who sue the State, but was tailor-made for taxpayers.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>id., </em>at 411.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0In other federal courts as well, \xc2\xa71341 has been read to restrain taxpayers from instituting federal actions to contest their liability for state taxes, but not to stop third parties from pursuing constitutional challenges to state tax benefits in a federal forum.  Further, numerous federal-court decisions\xe2\x80\x94including decisions of this Court reviewing lower federal-court judgments\xe2\x80\x94have reached the merits of third-party constitutional challenges to tax benefits without mentioning the TIA.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Byrne</em> v. <em>Public Funds for Public Schools of New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/907/index.html">442 U. S. 907</a>; <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/218/index.html">377 U. S. 218</a>.

See Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 (West Supp. 2003).  Plaintiffs below, respondents here, brought an action in federal court challenging \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089, and seeking to enjoin its operation, on Establishment Clause grounds.  The question presented is whether the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, which prohibits a lower federal court from restraining \xe2\x80\x9cthe assessment, levy or collection of any tax under State law,\xe2\x80\x9d bars the suit.  Plaintiffs-respondents do not contest their own tax liability.  Nor do they seek to impede Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of tax revenues.  Their suit, we hold, is not the kind \xc2\xa71341 proscribes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In decisions spanning a near half century, courts in the federal system, including this Court, have entertained challenges to tax credits authorized by state law, without conceiving of \xc2\xa71341 as a jurisdictional barrier.  On this first occasion squarely to confront the issue, we confirm the authority federal courts exercised in those cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is hardly ancient history that States, once bent on maintaining racial segregation in public schools, and allocating resources disproportionately to benefit white students to the detriment of black students, fastened on tui-\ntion grants and tax credits as a promising means to circumvent <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U. S. 483</a> (1954).  The federal courts, this Court among them, adjudicated the ensuing challenges, instituted under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, and upheld the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection requirement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/218/index.html"></a><a href="/us/377/218/index.html"></a><a href="/us/377/218/index.html">377 U. S. 218</a>, 233 (1964) (faced with unconstitutional closure of county public schools and tuition grants and tax credits for contributions to private segregated schools, District Court could require county to levy taxes to fund nondiscriminatory public schools), rev\xe2\x80\x99g 322 F.\xc2\xa02d 332, 343\xe2\x80\x93344 (CA4 1963) (abstention required until state courts determine validity of grants, tax credits, and public-school closing), aff\xe2\x80\x99g <em>Allen</em> v. <em>County</em> <em>School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty.</em>, 198 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 497, 503 (ED Va. 1961) (county enjoined from paying grants or providing tax credits to support private schools that exclude students based on race while public schools remain closed), and aff\xe2\x80\x99g 207 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 349, 355 (ED Va. 1962) (closure of public schools enjoined).  See also <em>Moton</em> v. <em>Lambert</em>, 508 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 367, 368 (ND Miss. 1981) (challenge to tax exemptions for racially discriminatory private schools may proceed in federal court).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case, petitioner Hibbs, Director of Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s Department of Revenue, argues, in effect, that we and other federal courts were wrong in those civil-rights cases.  The TIA, petitioner maintains, trumps \xc2\xa71983; the Act, according to petitioner, bars all lower federal-court interference with state tax systems, even when the challengers are not endeavoring to avoid a tax imposed on them, and no matter whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s revenues would be raised or lowered should the plaintiffs prevail.  The alleged jurisdictional bar, which petitioner asserts has existed since the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment in 1937, was not even imagined by the jurists in the pathmarking civil-rights cases just cited, or by the defendants in those cases, litigants with every interest in defeating federal-court adjudicatory authority.  Our prior decisions command no respect, petitioner urges, because they constitute mere \xe2\x80\x9csub silentio holdings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 8.  We reject that assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We examine in this opinion both the scope of the term \xe2\x80\x9cassessment\xe2\x80\x9d as used in the TIA, and the question whether the Act was intended to insulate state tax laws from constitutional challenge in lower federal courts even when the suit would have no negative impact on tax collection.  Concluding that this suit implicates neither \xc2\xa71341\xe2\x80\x99s conception of assessment nor any of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s underlying purposes, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plaintiffs-respondents, Arizona taxpayers, filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, challenging Ariz. Rev. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 (West Supp. 2003) as incompatible with the Establishment Clause.  Section 43\xe2\x80\x931089 provides a credit to taxpayers who contribute money to \xe2\x80\x9cschool tuition organizations\xe2\x80\x9d (STOs).  An STO is a nonprofit organization that directs moneys, in the form of scholarship grants, to students enrolled in private elementary or secondary schools.  STOs must disburse as scholarship grants at least 90 percent of contributions received, may allow donors to direct scholarships to individual students, may not allow donors to name their own dependents, must designate at least two schools whose students will receive funds, and must not designate schools  that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminate on the basis of race, color, handicap, familial status or national origin.\xe2\x80\x9d  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(D)\xe2\x80\x93(F).  STOs are not precluded by Arizona\xe2\x80\x99s statute from designating schools that provide religious instruction or that give admissions preference on the basis of religion or religious affiliation.  When taxpayers donate money to a qualified STO, \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 allows them, in calculating their Arizona tax liability, to credit up to $500 of their donation (or $625 for a married couple filing jointly, \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089(A)(2)).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In effect, \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 gives Arizona taxpayers an election.  They may direct $500 (or, for joint-return filers, $625) to an STO, or to the Arizona Department of Revenue.  As long as donors do not give STOs more than their total tax liability, their $500 or $625 contributions are costless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Arizona Supreme Court, by a 3-to-2 vote, rejected a facial challenge to \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 before the statute went into effect.  <em>Kotterman</em> v. <em>Killian</em>, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P.\xc2\xa02d 606 (1999) (en banc).

Section 2101(c) instructs that a petition for certiorari must be filed \xe2\x80\x9cwithin ninety days after the entry of \xe2\x80\xa6 judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 13(3) elaborates:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe time to file a petition for a writ of certiorari runs from the date of entry of the judgment or order sought to be reviewed, and not from the issuance date of the mandate (or its equivalent under local practice).  But if a petition for rehearing is timely filed in the lower court by any party, the time to file the petition for a writ of certiorari for all parties (whether or not they requested rehearing or joined in the petition for rehearing) runs from the date of the denial of the petition for rehearing or, if the petition for rehearing is granted, the subsequent entry of judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nRespondents assert that the Director\xe2\x80\x99s petition missed the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s deadlines: More than 90 days elapsed between the date the Court of Appeals first entered judgment and the date the petition was filed, rendering the filing untimely under the first sentence of the Rule; and because no party petitioned for rehearing, the extended periods prescribed by the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s second sentence never came into play.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case, however, did not follow the typical course. The Court of Appeals, on its own motion, recalled its mandate and ordered the parties to brief the question whether the case should be reheard en banc.  That order, we conclude, suspended the judgment\xe2\x80\x99s finality under \xc2\xa72101(c), just as a timely filed rehearing petition would, or a court\xe2\x80\x99s appropriate decision to consider a late-filed rehearing petition.

See <em>id.</em>, at 46 (\xe2\x80\x9cA timely petition for rehearing \xe2\x80\xa6 operates to suspend the finality of the \xe2\x80\xa6 court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, pending the court\xe2\x80\x99s further determination whether the judgment should be modified so as to alter its adjudication of the rights of the parties\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Department of Banking of Neb.</em> v. <em>Pink,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/317/264/index.html">317 U.

When the Court of Appeals ordered briefing on the rehearing issue, 90 days had not yet passed from the issuance of the panel opinion.  Because \xc2\xa72101(c)\xe2\x80\x99s 90-day limit had not yet expired, the clock could still be reset by an order that left unresolved whether the court would modify its judgment.  The court-initiated briefing order had just that effect.  Because a genuinely final judgment is critical under the statute, we must treat the date of the court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying rehearing en banc as the date judgment was entered.  The petition was filed within 90 days of that date and was thus timely under the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were we to read Rule 13 as our sole guide, so that only a rehearing petition filed by a party could reset the statute\xe2\x80\x99s 90-day count, we would lose sight of the congressional objective underpinning \xc2\xa72101(c): An appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s final adjudication, Congress indicated, marks the time from which the period allowed for a certiorari petition begins to run.  The statute takes priority over the \xe2\x80\x9cprocedural rules adopted by the Court for the orderly transaction of its business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Schacht</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/398/58/index.html">398 U.

The court did observe, broadly: \xe2\x80\x9c[The] requested relief, if granted,\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 would clearly conflict with the principle underlying the [TIA] that the federal courts should generally avoid interfering with the sensitive and peculiarly local concerns surrounding state taxation schemes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1242.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gillis</em>, unlike <em>Kraebel</em> and <em>Colonial Pipeline</em>, was a third-party action.  The court declined to decide \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether the [TIA] actually does bar the availability of such relief,\xe2\x80\x9d but noted that a suit seeking to enhance state revenues may nonetheless fall within \xc2\xa71341\xe2\x80\x99s bar because \xe2\x80\x9cthe Act is not, by its own language, limited to the <em>collection</em> of taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  836 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1005 (emphasis in original).  Finally, <em>Perez</em> concerned the Butler Act, 48 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7872, a TIA analog applicable to Puerto Rico.  Ordering dismissal of the case for want of jurisdiction, the court rested its decision not on statutory construction, but on \xe2\x80\x9cunderl[ying]\xe2\x80\x9d comity concerns, stating: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]n order of a federal court requiring Commonwealth officials to collect taxes which its legislature has not seen fit to impose on its citizens strikes us as a particularly inappropriate involvement in a state\xe2\x80\x99s management of its fiscal operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  592 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 1214\xe2\x80\x931215.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In school desegregation cases, as a last resort, federal courts have asserted authority to direct the imposition of, or increase in, local tax levies, even in amounts exceeding the ceiling set by state law.

Two points make clear that the Court treats States as diminished and disfavored powers, rather than merely applies statutory text.  First, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the Tax Injunction Act (TIA or Act), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341, contrasts with a literal reading of its terms.  Second, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that legislative histories support the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hird-party suits not seeking to stop the collection (or contest the validity) of a tax <em>imposed on plaintiffs</em> . . . were outside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 purview\xe2\x80\x9d in enacting the TIA and the anti-injunction provision on which the TIA was modeled, <em>ante</em>, at 12, is not borne out by those sources, as previously recognized by the Court.  In light of these points, today\xe2\x80\x99s holding should probably be attributed to the concern the Court candidly shows animates it.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (noting it was the federal courts that \xe2\x80\x9cupheld the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s equal protection requirement\xe2\x80\x9d when States circumvented <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Board of Education,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/347/483/index.html">347 U. S. 483</a> (1954), by manipulating their tax laws).  The concern, it seems, is that state courts are second rate constitutional arbiters, unequal to their federal counterparts.  State courts are due more respect than this.  Dismissive treatment of state courts is particularly unjustified since the TIA, by express terms, provides a federal safeguard: The Act lifts its bar on federal court intervention when state courts fail to provide \xe2\x80\x9ca plain, speedy, and efficient remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71341.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In view of the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s text, the congressional judgment that state courts are qualified constitutional arbiters, and the respect state courts deserve, I disagree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s superseding the balance the Act strikes between federal and state court adjudication.  I agree with the majority that the petition for certiorari was timely under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72101(c), see <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x938, and so submit this respectful dissent on the merits of the decision.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Today is the first time the Court has considered\nwhether the TIA bars federal district courts from granting injunctive relief that would prevent States from giving citizens statutorily mandated state tax credits.  There are cases, some dating back almost 50 years, which proceeded as if the jurisdictional bar did not apply to tax credit challenges; but some more recent decisions have said the bar is applicable.  Compare, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Mueller</em> v. <em>Allen,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/388/index.html">463 U. S. 388</a> (1983); <em>Committee for Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty</em> v. <em>Nyquist,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/index.html">413 U. S. 756</a> (1973); <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>School Bd. of Prince Edward Cty.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/218/index.html">377 U. S. 218</a> (1964), with, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ACLU Foundation of La.</em> v. <em>Bridges</em>, 334 F.\xc2\xa03d 416 (CA5 2003); <em>In\xc2\xa0re Gillis</em>, 836 F.\xc2\xa02d 1001 (CA6 1988).  While unexamined custom favors the first position, the statutory text favors the latter.  In these circumstances a careful explanation for the conclusion is necessary; but in the end the scope and purpose of the Act should be understood from its terms alone.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented\xe2\x80\x94whether the TIA bars the District Court from granting injunctive relief against the tax credit\xe2\x80\x94requires two inquiries.  First, the term assessment, as used in \xc2\xa71341, must be defined.  Second, we must determine if an injunction prohibiting the Director from allowing the credit would enjoin, suspend, or restrain an assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The word assessment in the TIA is not isolated from its use in another federal statute.  The TIA was modeled on the anti-injunction provision of the Internal Revenue Code (Code), 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a).  See <em>Jefferson County</em> v. <em>Acker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/423/index.html">527 U. S. 423</a>, 434 (1999).  That provision specifies, and has specified since 1867, that federal courts may not restrain or enjoin an \xe2\x80\x9cassessment or collection of any [federal] tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77421(a) (first codified by Act of Mar. 2, 1867, ch. 169, \xc2\xa710, 14 Stat. 475).  The meaning of the term assessment in this Code provision is discernible by reference to other Code sections.  Title 26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71 <em>et seq</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chapter 63 of Title 26 addresses the subject of assessments and sheds light on the meaning of the term in the Code.  Section 6201 first instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary [of the Internal Revenue Service] is . . . required to make the . . . assessments of all taxes . . . imposed by this title. . .\xe2\x80\x9d  26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76201(a).  Further it provides, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Secretary shall assess all taxes determined by the taxpayer or by the Secretary . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76201(a)(1).  Section 6203 in turn sets forth a method for making an assessment: \xe2\x80\x9cThe assessment shall be made by recording the liability of the taxpayer in the office of the Secretary.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taken together, the provisions of Title 26 establish that an assessment, as that term is used in \xc2\xa77421(a), must at the least encompass the recording of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate tax liability.  This is what the taxpayer owes the Government.  See also <em>Laing</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/161/index.html">423 U. S. 161</a>, 170, n. 13 (1976) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98assessment,\xe2\x80\x99 essentially a bookkeeping notation, is made when the Secretary or his delegate establishes an account against the taxpayer on the tax rolls\xe2\x80\x9d).  Whether the Secretary or his delegate (today, the Commissioner) makes the recording on the basis of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s self-reported filing form or instead chooses to rely on his own calculation of the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s liability (<em>e.g.</em>, via an audit) is irrelevant.  The recording of the liability on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s tax rolls is itself an assessment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The TIA was modeled on the anti-injunction provision, see <em>Jefferson County</em>, <em>supra;</em> it incorporates the same terminology employed by the provision; and it employs that terminology for the same purpose.  It is sensible, then, to interpret the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s terms by reference to the Code\xe2\x80\x99s use of the term.  Cf. <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U. S. 575</a>, 581 (1978) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here, as here, Congress adopts a new law incorporating sections of a prior law, Congress normally can be presumed to have had knowledge of the interpretation given to the incorporated law, at least insofar as it affects the new statute\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court of Appeals, which concluded that an assessment was the official estimate of the value of income or property used to calculate a tax or the imposition of a tax on someone, <em>Winn</em> v. <em>Killian</em>, 307 F.\xc2\xa03d 1011, 1015 (CA9 2002), placed principal reliance for its interpretation on a dictionary definition.  That was not entirely misplaced; but unless the definition is considered in the context of the prior statute, the advantage of that statute\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive guidance is lost.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the court defined the term in an unusual way.  It relied on a dictionary that was unavailable when the TIA was enacted; it relied not on the definition of the term under consideration, \xe2\x80\x9cassessment,\xe2\x80\x9d but on the definition of the term\xe2\x80\x99s related verb form, \xe2\x80\x9cassess;\xe2\x80\x9d and it examined only a portion of that terms\xe2\x80\x99 definition.  In the dictionary used by the Court of Appeals, the verb is defined in two ways not noted by the court.  One of the alternative definitions is quite relevant\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c(2) to fix or determine the amount of (damages, a tax, a fine, etc.).\xe2\x80\x9d  Compare 307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1015, with Random House Dictionary of the English Language 90 (1979).  Further,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cHad [the panel] looked in a different lay dictionary, [it] would have found a definition contrary to the one it preferred, such as \xe2\x80\x98the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing.\xe2\x80\x99  . . . Had the panel considered tax treatises and law dictionaries . . . it would have found much in accord with this broader definition. . . . Even the federal income tax code supports a broad reading of \xe2\x80\x98assessment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Winn</em> v. <em>Killian</em>, 321 F.\xc2\xa03d 911, 912 (2003) (Kleinfeld, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Guided first by the Internal Revenue Code, an assessment under \xc2\xa71341, at a minimum, is the recording of taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 liability on the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax rolls.  The TIA, though a federal statute that must be interpreted as a matter of federal law, operates in a state-law context.  In this respect, the Act must be interpreted so as to apply evenly to the 50 various state-law regimes and to the various recording schemes States employ.  It is therefore irrelevant whether state officials record taxpayer liabilities with their own pen in a specified location, by collecting and maintaining taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 self-reported filing forms, or in some other manner.  The recordkeeping that equates to the determination of taxpayer liability on the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax rolls is the assessment, whatever the method.  The Court seems to agree with this.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dictionary definition of assessment provides further relevant information.  Contemporaneous dictionaries from the time of the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment define assessment in expansive terms.  They would broaden any understanding of the term, and so the Act\xe2\x80\x99s bar.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 139 (1927) (providing three context relevant definitions for the term assessment: It is the act of apportioning or determining an amount to be paid; a valuation of property for the purpose of taxation; or the entire plan or scheme fixed upon for charging or taxing).  See also <em>United States</em> v. <em>Galletti</em>, 541 U. S. \xe2\x80\x94, \xe2\x80\x94 (2004) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938) (noting that under the Code the term assessment refers not only to recordings of tax liability but also to \xe2\x80\x9cthe calculation . . . of a tax liability,\xe2\x80\x9d including self-calculation done by the taxpayer).  The Court need not decide the full scope of the term assessment in the TIA, however.  For present purposes, a narrow definition of the term suffices.  Applying the narrowest definition, the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s literal text bars district courts from enjoining, suspending, or restraining a State\xe2\x80\x99s recording of taxpayer liability on its tax rolls, whether the recordings are made by self-reported taxpayer filing forms or by a State\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of taxpayer liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The terms \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin, suspend, or restrain\xe2\x80\x9d require little scrutiny.  No doubt, they have discrete purposes in the context of the TIA; but they also have a common meaning.  They refer to actions that restrict assessments to varying degrees.  It is noteworthy that the term \xe2\x80\x9cenjoin\xe2\x80\x9d has not just its meaning in the restrictive sense but also has meaning in an affirmative sense.  The Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary current at the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment gives as a definition of the term, \xe2\x80\x9cto require; command; positively direct.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 663 (3d ed. 1933).  That definition may well be implicated here, since an order invalidating a tax credit would seem to command States to collect taxes they otherwise would not collect.  The parties, however, proceed on the assumption that enjoin means to bar.  It is unobjectionable for the Court to make the assumption too, leaving the broader definition for later consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue the TIA does not bar the injunction they seek because even after the credit is enjoined, the Director will be able to record and enforce taxpayers\xe2\x80\x99 liabilities.  See Brief for Respondents 16.  In fact, respondents say, with the credit out of the way the Director will be able to record and enforce a higher level of liability and so profit the State.  <em>Ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe amount of tax payable by some taxpayers would increase, but that can hardly be characterized as an injunction or restraint of the assessment process\xe2\x80\x9d).  The argument, however, ignores an important part of the Act: \xe2\x80\x9cunder State law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts shall not enjoin, suspend or restrain the assessment . . . of any tax under State law\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Act not only bars district courts from enjoining, suspending, or restraining a State\xe2\x80\x99s recording of taxpayer liabilities altogether; but it also bars them from enjoining, suspending, or restraining a State from recording the taxpayer liability that state law mandates.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 43\xe2\x80\x931089 is state law.  It is an integral part of the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax statute; it is reflected on state tax forms; and the State Supreme Court has held that it is part of the calculus necessary to determine tax liability.  See <em>Kotterman</em> v. <em>Killian</em>, 193 Ariz. 273, 279, 285, 972 P.\xc2\xa02d 606, 612, 618 (1999).  A recording of a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s liability under state law must be made in accordance with \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089.  The same can be said with respect to each and every provision of the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax law.  To order the Director not to record on the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax rolls taxpayer liability that reflects the operation of \xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x931089 (or any other state tax law provision for that matter) would be to bar the Director from recording the correct taxpayer liability.  The TIA\xe2\x80\x99s language bars this relief and so bars this suit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court tries to avoid this conclusion by saying that the recordings that constitute assessments under \xc2\xa71341 must have a \xe2\x80\x9ccollection-propelling function,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11, and that the recordings at issue here do not have such a function.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa04 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he dissent would disconnect the word [assessment] from the enforcement process\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is wrong.  A recording of taxpayer liability on the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax rolls of course propels collection.  In most cases the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s payment will accompany his filing, and thus will accompany the assessment so that no literal collection of moneys is necessary.  As anyone who has paid taxes must know, however, if owed payment were not included with the tax filing, the State\xe2\x80\x99s recording of one\xe2\x80\x99s liability on the State\xe2\x80\x99s rolls would certainly cause subsequent collection efforts, for the filing\xe2\x80\x99s recording (<em>i.e.</em>, the assessment) would propel collection by establishing the State\xe2\x80\x99s legal right to the taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s moneys.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority offers prior judicial interpretations of the Code\xe2\x80\x99s similarly worded anti-injunction provision to support its contrary conclusions about the statutory text.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  That this Court and other federal courts have allowed nontaxpayer suits challenging tax credits to proceed in the face of the anti-injunction provision is not at all controlling.  Those cases are quite distinguishable.  Had the plaintiffs in those cases been barred from suit, there would have been no available forum at all for their claims.  See <em>McGlotten</em> v. <em>Connally</em>, 338 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 448, 453\xe2\x80\x93454 (DC 1972) (three-judge court) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe preferred course of raising [such tax exemption and deduction] objections in a suit for refund is not available.  In this situation we cannot read the statute to bar the present suit\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also <em>Tax Analysts and Advocates</em> v. <em>Shultz</em>, 376 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 889, 892 (DC 1974) (\xe2\x80\x9cSince plaintiffs are not seeking to restrain the collection of taxes, and since they cannot obtain relief through a refund suit, [26 U. S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa77421(a) does not bar the injunctive relief they seek\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court ratified those decisions only insofar as they relied on this limited rationale as the basis for an exception to the statutory bar on adjudication.  See <em>South Carolina</em> v. <em>Regan,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/465/367/index.html">465 U. S. 367</a>, 373 (1984) (holding the anti-injunction provision inapplicable to a State\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the constitutionality of a federal tax exemption provision, \xc2\xa7103(a) of the Code (which exempts from a taxpayer\xe2\x80\x99s gross income the interest earned on the obligations of any State) as amended by \xc2\xa7310(b)(1) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, 96 Stat. 596, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe [anti-injunction provision] was not intended to bar an action where . . . Congress has not provided the plaintiff with an alternative legal way to challenge the validity of a tax\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even that strict limitation was not strict enough for four Members of the Court, one of whom noted \xe2\x80\x9cthe broad sweep of the [a]nti-[i]njunction [provision].\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 382 (Blackmun, J., concurring in judgment).  The other three Justices went further still.  They would have allowed an exception to the anti-injunction provision\xe2\x80\x99s literal bar on nontaxpayer suits challenging tax exemption provisions only if due process rights were at stake.  See 465 U. S., at 394 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Bob Jones University</em>\xe2\x80\x99s recognition that the complete inaccessibility of judicial review might implicate due process concerns provides absolutely no basis for crafting an exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the anti-injunction act for a plaintiff who has \xe2\x80\x9cno due process right to review of its claim in a judicial forum\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast to the anti-injunction provision, the TIA on its own terms ensures an adequate forum for claims it bars.  The TIA specially exempts actions that could not be heard in state courts by providing an exception for instances \xe2\x80\x9cwhere a plain, speedy, and efficient remedy may [not] be had in the courts of [the] State.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341.  The TIA\xe2\x80\x99s text thus already incorporates the check that <em>Regan</em> concluded could be read into the anti-injunction provision even though \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [anti-injunction provision]\xe2\x80\x99s language \xe2\x80\x98could scarcely be more explicit\xe2\x80\x99 in prohibiting nontaxpayer suits like this one.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 U. S., at 385 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (quoting <em>Bob Jones Univ.</em> v. <em>Simon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/725/index.html">416 U. S. 725</a>, 736 (1974)).  The practical effect is that a literal reading of the TIA provides for federal district courts to stand at the ready where litigants encounter legal or practical obstacles to challenging state tax credits in state courts.  And this Court, of course, stands at the ready to review decisions by state courts on these matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court does not discuss this codified exception, yet the clause is crucial.  It represents a congressional judgment about the balance that should exist between the respect due to the States (for both their administration of tax schemes and their courts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of tax laws) and the need for constitutional vindication.  To ignore the provision is to ignore that Congress has already balanced these interests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents admit they would be heard in state court.  Indeed a quite similar action previously was heard there.  See <em>Kotterman</em> v. <em>Killian</em>, 193 Ariz. 273, 972 P.\xc2\xa02d 606 (1999).  As a result, the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s exception (akin to that recognized by <em>Regan</em>) does not apply.  To proceed as if it does is to replace Congress\xe2\x80\x99 balancing of the noted interests with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court and respondents further argue that the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s policy purposes and relatedly the federal anti-injunction provision\xe2\x80\x99s policy purposes (as discerned from legislative histories) justify today\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  The two Acts, they say, reflect a unitary purpose: \xe2\x80\x9cIn both . . . Congress directed taxpayers to pursue refund suits instead of attempting to restrain [tax] collections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 14 (concluding that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s underlying purpose is to bar suits by \xe2\x80\x9ctaxpayers who sought to avoid paying their tax bill\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Brief for Respondents 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  This purpose, the Court and respondents say, shows that the Act was not intended to foreclose relief in challenges to tax credits.  The proposition rests on the premise that the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s sole purpose is to prevent district court orders that would decrease the moneys in state fiscs.  Because the legislative histories of the Acts are not carefully limited in the manner that this reading suggests, the policy argument against a literal application of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s terms fails.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taking the federal anti-injunction provision first, as has been noted before, \xe2\x80\x9c[its] history expressly reflects the congressional desire that all injunctive suits against the tax collector be prohibited.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Regan</em>, 465 U. S., at 387 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  The provision responded to \xe2\x80\x9cthe grave dangers which accompany intrusion of the injunctive power of the courts into the administration of the revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 388.  It \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally precludes judicial resolution of all abstract tax controversies,\xe2\x80\x9d whether brought by a taxpayer or a nontaxpayer.  <em>Id.,</em> at 392; see also <em>id.,</em> at 387\xe2\x80\x93392 (reviewing the legislative history of the anti-injunction provision, its various amendments, and related enactments).  Thus, the provision\xe2\x80\x99s object is not just to bar suits that might \xe2\x80\x9cinterrupt \xe2\x80\x98the process of collecting . . . taxes,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c[s]imilarly, the language and history evidence a congressional desire to prohibit courts from restraining any aspect of the tax laws\xe2\x80\x99 administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 399.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history is also inconsistent with the interpretation of this same history in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s earlier cases.  The Court has made clear that the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is not only to protect the fisc but also to protect the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax system administration and tax policy implementation.  <em>California</em> v. <em>Grace Brethren Church,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/393/index.html">457 U. S. 393</a> (1982), is a prime example.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Grace Brethren Church </em>the Court held that the TIA not only bars actions by individuals to stop tax collectors from collecting moneys (<em>i.e.</em>, injunctive suits) but also bars declaratory suits.  See <em>id.,</em> at 408\xe2\x80\x93410.  The Court explained that permitting declaratory suits to proceed would \xe2\x80\x9cdefea[t] the principal purpose of the Tax Injunction Act: \xe2\x80\x98to limit drastically federal district court jurisdiction to interfere with so important a local concern as the collection of taxes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 408\xe2\x80\x93409 (quoting <em>Rosewell</em> v. <em>LaSalle Nat. Bank,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/450/503/index.html">450 U. S. 503</a> (1981)).  It continued:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98If federal declaratory relief were available to test state tax assessments, state tax administration might be thrown into disarray, and taxpayers might escape the ordinary procedural requirements imposed by state law.  During the pendency of the federal suit the collection of revenue under the challenged law might be obstructed, with consequent damage to the State\xe2\x80\x99s budget, and perhaps a shift to the State of the risk of taxpayer insolvency.  Moreover, federal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grace Brethren Church</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 410 (quoting with approval <em>Perez</em> v. <em>Ledesma,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/82/index.html">401 U. S. 82</a>, 128, n. 17 (1971) (Brennan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this, of course, demonstrates that protecting the state fisc from damage is part of the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, it equally shows that actions that would throw the \xe2\x80\x9cstate tax administration . . . into disarray\xe2\x80\x9d also implicate the Act and its purpose.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s concern with preventing administrative disarray puts in context its explanation that the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s principal concern is to limit federal district court interference with the \xe2\x80\x9ccollection of taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  The phrase, in this context, refers to the operation of the whole tax collection system and the implementation of entire tax policy, not just a part of it.  While an order interfering with a specific collection suit disrupts one of the most essential aspects of a State\xe2\x80\x99s tax system, it is not the only way in which federal courts can disrupt the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax system:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legislative history of the Tax Injunction Act demonstrates that Congress worried not so much about the form of relief available in the federal courts, as about divesting the federal courts of jurisdiction to interfere with state tax administration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grace Brethen Church</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 409, n. 22.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions in <em>Fair Assessment in Real Estate Assn., Inc.</em> v. <em>McNary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/100/index.html">454 U. S. 100</a> (1981), <em>National Private Truck Council, Inc.</em> v. <em>Oklahoma Tax Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/582/index.html">515 U. S. 582</a> (1995) <em>(NPTC)</em>, and <em>Rosewell</em>, <em>supra</em>, make the same point.  Though the majority says these cases support its holding because they \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved plaintiffs who mounted federal litigation to avoid paying state taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, the language of these cases is too clear to be ignored and is contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding today.  In <em>Fair Assessment</em>, the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he [TIA] \xe2\x80\x98has its roots in equity practice, in principles of federalism, and in recognition of the imperative need of a State to administer its own fiscal operations.\xe2\x80\x99  This last consideration was [its] principal motivating force.\xe2\x80\x9d  454 U. S., at 110 (quoting <em>Rosewell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 522 (in turn quoting <em>Tully</em> v. <em>Griffin, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/68/index.html">429 U. S. 68</a>, 73 (1976)) (other citation omitted)).  In <em>NPTC</em>, the Court said, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress and this Court repeatedly have shown an aversion to federal interference with state tax administration.  The passage of the [TIA] in 1937 is one manifestation of this aversion.\xe2\x80\x9d  515 U. S., at 586 (summing up this aversion, generated also from principles of comity and federalism, as creating a \xe2\x80\x9cbackground presumption that federal law generally will not interfere with administration of state taxes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 588).  In <em>Rosewell</em>, the Court described the Act\xe2\x80\x99s language as \xe2\x80\x9cbroad\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprophylactic.\xe2\x80\x9d  450 U. S., at 524 (majority opinion of Brennan, J.).  See also <em>ibid.</em> (the TIA was \xe2\x80\x9cpassed to limit federal-court interference in state tax matters\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act is designed to respect not only the administration of state tax systems but also state court authority to say what state law means.  \xe2\x80\x9c[F]ederal constitutional issues are likely to turn on questions of state tax law, which, like issues of state regulatory law, are more properly heard in the state courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Grace Brethren Church</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 410 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See also <em>Rosewell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 527.  This too establishes that the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is not solely to ensure that the State\xe2\x80\x99s fisc is not decreased.  There would be only a diminished interest in allowing state courts to say what the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax statutes mean if the Act protected just the state fisc.  The TIA protects the responsibility of the States and their courts to administer their own tax systems and to be accountable to the citizens of the State for their policies and decisions.  The majority objects that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no disagreement to the meaning of\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d state law in this case, <em>ante</em>, at 15, n.\xc2\xa05.  As an initial matter, it is not clear that this is a fair conclusion.  The litigation in large part turns on what state law requires and whether the product of those requirements violates the Constitution.  More to the point, however, even if there were no controversy about the statutory framework the Arizona tax provision creates, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s ruling has implications far beyond this case and will most certainly result in federal courts in other States and in other cases being required to interpret state tax law in order to complete their review of challenges to state tax statutes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our heretofore consistent interpretation of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history to prohibit interference with state tax systems and their administration accords with the direct, broad, and unqualified language of the statute.  The Act bars all orders that enjoin, suspend, or restrain the assessment of any tax under state law.  In effecting congressional intent we should give full force to simple and broad proscriptions in the statutory language.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the TIA\xe2\x80\x99s language and purpose are comprehensive, arguments based on congressional silence on the question whether the TIA applies to actions that increase moneys a state tax system collects are of no moment.  Contra, <em>Winn</em>, 307 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1017\xe2\x80\x931018 (relying on <em>Dunn</em> v. <em>Carey</em>, 808 F.\xc2\xa02d 555, 558 (CA7 1986)); see also <em>ante,</em> at 18 (relying on <em>Dunn</em>).  Whatever weight one gives to legislative histories, silence in the legislative record is irrelevant when a plain congressional declaration exists on a matter.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen terms are unambiguous we may not speculate on probabilities of intention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Insurance Co.</em> v. <em>Ritchie,</em> 5 Wall. 541, 545 (1867).  Here, Congress has said district courts are barred from disrupting the State\xe2\x80\x99s tax operations.  It is immaterial whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s collection is raised or lowered.  A court order will thwart and replace the State\xe2\x80\x99s chosen tax policy if it causes either result.  No authority supports the proposition that a State lacks an interest in reducing its citizens\xe2\x80\x99 tax burden.  It is a troubling proposition for this Court to proceed on the assumption that the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in limiting the tax burden on its citizens to that for which its law provides is a secondary policy, deserving of little respect from us.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final basis on which both the majority and respondents rest is that years of unexamined habit by litigants and the courts alike have resulted in federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 entertaining challenges to state tax credits.  See <em>ante</em>, at 19\xe2\x80\x9320<font b="1"> (citing representative cases).  While we should not reverse the course of our unexamined practice lightly, our obligation is to give a correct interpretation of the statute.  We are not obliged to maintain the status quo when the status quo is unfounded.  The exercise of federal jurisdiction does not and cannot establish jurisdiction.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>L. A. Tucker Truck Lines, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/344/33/index.html">344 U. S. 33</a>, 37\xe2\x80\x9338 (1952).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court is not bound by a prior exercise of jurisdiction in a case where it was not questioned and it was passed <em>sub silentio</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 38.  In this respect, the present case is no different than <em>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>NRA Political Victory Fund,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/88/index.html">513 U. S. 88</a> (1994).  The case presented the question whether we had jurisdiction to consider a certiorari petition filed by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), and not by the Solicitor General on behalf of the FEC.  The Court held that it lacked jurisdiction.  See <em>id.,</em> at 99.  Though that answer seemed to contradict the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior practices, the Court said:</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cNor are we impressed by the FEC\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it has represented itself before this Court on several occasions in the past without any question having been raised about its authority to do so . . . .
