They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s doors or frames, but may install either those belts or simple lap belts on rear inner seats, <em>e.g., </em>those next to a minivan\xe2\x80\x99s aisle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Williamson family and Thanh Williamson\xe2\x80\x99s estate brought this California tort suit, claiming that Thanh died in an accident because the rear aisle seat of the Mazda minivan in which she was riding had a lap belt instead of lap-and-shoulder belts.  The state trial court dismissed their claim on the pleadings.  The State Court of Appeal affirmed, relying on <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a>, in which this Court found that an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS 208\xe2\x80\x94which required installation of passive restraint devices\xe2\x80\x94pre-empted a state tort suit against an auto manufacturer on a failure to install airbags.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, instead of lap belts, on rear inner seats.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Because this case involves (1) the same statute as <em>Geier, </em>(2) a later version of the same regulation, and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation, the answers to two of the subsidiary questions posed in <em>Geier </em>apply directly here.  Thus, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause cannot pre-empt the common-law tort action here; but neither can its saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption principles.  The Court consequently turns to <em>Geier</em>\xe2\x80\x99s third subsidiary question<em>,</em> whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal law is pre-empted.  <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U. S. 52</a>, 67.  In <em>Geier, </em>the state law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of a significant federal regulatory objective, namely, giving manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint systems.  This conclusion was supported by the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current understanding of the regulation.  The history showed that the Department of Transportation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufacturers with a choice of systems.  DOT\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation of the regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an important means for achieving DOT\xe2\x80\x99s basic objectives.  It phased in passive restraint requirements to give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and develop better systems; it worried that requiring airbags would cause a public backlash; and it was concerned about airbag safety and cost.  Finally, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current understanding was that a tort suit insisting upon airbag use would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S.em&gt;., at 883.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Like the regulation in <em>Geier</em>,<em> </em>the instant regulation leaves the manufacturer with a choice, and the tort suit here would restrict that choice.  But in contrast to <em>Geier, </em>the choice here is not a significant regulatory objective.  The regulation\xe2\x80\x99s history resembles the history of airbags to some degree.  DOT rejected a regulation requiring lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats in 1984.  But by 1989, changed circumstances led DOT to require manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder belts for rear outer seats but to retain a manufacturer choice for rear inner seats.  Its reasons for doing so differed considerably from its 1984 reasons for permitting a choice of passive restraint.  It was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it thought that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety and did not pose additional safety risks; and it was not seeking to use the regulation to spur development of alternative safety devices.  Instead, DOT thought that the requirement would not be cost effective.  That fact alone cannot show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits.  For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.  For another, many federal safety regulations embody a cost-effectiveness judgment.  To infer pre-emptive intent from the mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment would eliminate the possibility that the agency seeks only to set forth a minimum standard.  Finally, the Solicitor General represents that DOT\xe2\x80\x99s regulation does not pre-empt this tort suit.  As in <em>Geier,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthe agency\xe2\x80\x99s own views should make a difference,\xe2\x80\x9d 529 U. S., at 883, and DOT has not expressed inconsistent views on this subject.

They must install lap-and-shoulder belts on seats next to a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s doors or frames.  But they have a choice about what to install on rear inner seats (say, middle seats or those next to a minivan\xe2\x80\x99s aisle).  There they can install either (1) simple lap belts or (2) lap-and-shoulder belts.  54 Fed. Reg. 46257\xe2\x80\x9346258 (1989); 49 CFR \xc2\xa7571.208 (1993), promulgated pursuant to the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Act), 80 Stat. 718, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71381 <em>et seq.</em> (1988 ed.) (recodified without substantive change at 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730101 <em>et seq. </em>(2006 ed.)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented here is whether this federal regulation pre-empts a state tort suit that, if successful, would deny manufacturers a choice of belts for rear inner seats by imposing tort liability upon those who choose to install a simple lap belt.  We conclude that providing manufacturers with this seatbelt choice is not a significant objective of the federal regulation.  Consequently, the regulation does not pre-empt the state tort suit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2002, the Williamson family, riding in their 1993 Mazda minivan, was struck head on by another vehicle.  Thanh Williamson was sitting in a rear aisle seat, wearing a lap belt; she died in the accident. Delbert and Alexa Williamson were wearing lap-and-shoulder belts; they survived.  They, along with Thanh\xe2\x80\x99s estate, subsequently brought this California tort suit against Mazda.  They claimed that Mazda should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts on rear aisle seats, and that Thanh died because Mazda equipped her seat with a lap belt instead.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California trial court dismissed this tort claim on the basis of the pleadings.  And the California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The appeals court noted that in <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a> (2000), this Court considered whether a different portion of (an older version of) Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard 208 (FMVSS 208)\xe2\x80\x94a portion that required installation of passive restraint devices\xe2\x80\x94pre-empted a state tort suit that sought to hold an auto manufacturer liable for failure to install a particular kind of passive restraint, namely, airbags.  We found that the federal regulation intended to assure manufacturers that they would retain a choice of installing any of several different passive restraint devices.  And the regulation sought to assure them that they would not have to exercise this choice in favor of airbags.  For that reason we thought that the federal regulation pre-empted a state tort suit that, by premising tort liability on a failure to install airbags, would have deprived the manufacturers of the choice that the federal regulation had assured them. <em> Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 874\xe2\x80\x93875.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court saw considerable similarity between this case and <em>Geier.  </em>The federal regulation at issue here gives manufacturers a choice among two different kinds of seatbelts for rear inner seats.  And a state lawsuit that premises tort liability on a failure to install a particular kind of seatbelt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, would in effect deprive the manufacturer of that choice.  The court concluded that, as in <em>Geier, </em>the federal regulation pre-empts the state tort suit.  167 Cal. App. 4th 905, 84 Cal. Rptr. 3d 545 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Williamsons sought certiorari.  And we granted certiorari in light of the fact that several courts have interpreted <em>Geier </em>as indicating that FMVSS 208 pre-empts state tort suits claiming that manufacturers should have installed lap-and-shoulder belts, not lap belts, on rear inner seats.  <em>Carden</em> v. <em>General Motors Corp.</em>, 509 F.\xc2\xa03d 227 (CA5 2007); <em>Roland</em> v. <em>General Motors Corp.</em>, 881 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 722 (Ind. App. 2008); <em>Heinricher</em> v. <em>Volvo Car Corp.</em>, 61 Mass. App. 313, 809 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1094 (2004).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Geier</em>,<em> </em>we considered a portion of an earlier (1984) version of FMVSS 208.  That regulation required manufacturers to equip their vehicles with passive restraint systems, thereby providing occupants with automatic accident protection.  49 Fed. Reg. 28983 (1984).  But that regulation also gave manufacturers a choice among several different passive restraint systems, including airbags and automatic seatbelts.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28996.  The question before the Court was whether the Act, together with the regulation, pre-empted a state tort suit that would have held a manufacturer liable for not installing airbags.  529 U. S., at 865.  By requiring manufacturers to install airbags (in order to avoid tort liability) the tort suit would have deprived the manufacturers of the choice among passive restraint systems that the federal regulation gave them.  See <em>Hillsborough County</em> v. <em>Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/707/index.html">471 U. S. 707</a>, 713 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]tate laws can be pre-empted by federal regulations as well as by federal statutes\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We divided this basic pre-emption question into three subsidiary questions.  529 U. S., at 867.  First, we asked whether the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>express</em> pre-emption provision preempted the state tort suit.  That statutory clause says that \xe2\x80\x9cno State\xe2\x80\x9d may \xe2\x80\x9cestablish, or . . . continue in effect . . . <em>any safety standard</em> applicable to the same aspect of performance\xe2\x80\x9d of a motor vehicle or item of equipment \xe2\x80\x9cwhich is not identical to the Federal standard.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71392(d) (1988 ed.) (emphasis added).  We had previously held that a word somewhat similar to \xe2\x80\x9cstandard,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9crequirements\xe2\x80\x9d (found in a similar statute) included within its scope state \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-law duties,\xe2\x80\x9d such as duties created by state tort law.  <em>Medtronic, Inc.</em> v. <em>Lohr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/470/index.html">518 U. S. 470</a>, 502\xe2\x80\x93503 (1996) (plurality opinion); <em>id.</em>, at 503\xe2\x80\x93505 (Breyer, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); <em>id.</em>, at 509\xe2\x80\x93512 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  But we nonetheless held that the state tort suit in question fell <em>outside </em>the scope of this particular pre-emption clause.  That is primarily because the statute also contains a saving clause, which says that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with\xe2\x80\x9d a federal safety standard \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not exempt any person <em>from any liability under common law</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71397(k) (emphasis added).  Since tort law is ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9ccommon law,\xe2\x80\x9d we held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence of the saving clause,\xe2\x80\x9d makes clear that Congress intended state tort suits to fall outside the scope of the express pre-emption clause.  <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S., at 868.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, we asked the converse question: The saving clause <em>at least </em>removes tort actions from the scope of the express pre-emption clause.  <em>Id.</em>, at 869.  But does it do more?  Does it foreclose or limit \xe2\x80\x9cthe operation of ordinary<em> </em>pre-emption principles insofar as those principles instruct us to read\xe2\x80\x9d federal statutes as pre-empting state laws (including state common-law standards) that \xe2\x80\x9cactually conflict\xe2\x80\x9d with the federal statutes (or related regulations)?  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  We concluded that the saving clause does not foreclose or limit the operation of \xe2\x80\x9cordinary pre-emption principles, grounded in longstanding precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 874.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These two holdings apply directly to the case before us.  We here consider (1) the same statute, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71381 <em>et seq.;</em> (2) a later version of the same regulation, FMVSS 208; and (3) a somewhat similar claim that a state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.  In light of <em>Geier,</em> the statute\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause cannot pre-empt the common-law tort action; but neither can the statute\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause foreclose or limit the operation of ordinary conflict pre-emption principles.  We consequently turn our attention to <em>Geier\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>third subsidiary question, whether, in fact, the state tort action conflicts with the federal regulation.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under ordinary conflict pre-emption principles a state law that \xe2\x80\x9cstands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal law is pre-empted.  <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U. S. 52</a>, 67 (1941).  See <em>ibid.</em> (federal statute can pre-empt a state statute); <em>Cipollone</em> v. <em>Liggett Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/504/index.html">505 U. S. 504</a> (1992) (federal statute can pre-empt a state tort suit); <em>Fidelity Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</em> v. <em>De la Cuesta</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/141/index.html">458 U. S. 141</a> (1982) (federal regulation can pre-empt a state statute); <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em> (federal regulation can pre-empt a state tort suit).  In <em>Geier </em>we found that the state law stood as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98obstacle\xe2\x80\x99 to the accomplishment\xe2\x80\x9d of a significant federal regulatory objective, namely, the maintenance of manufacturer choice.  529 U. S., at 886.  We must decide whether the same is true here.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the heart of <em>Geier </em>lies our determination that giving auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds\nof passive restraint devices was a <em>significant objective </em>of the federal regulation.  We reached this conclusion on\nthe basis of our examination of the regulation, including its history, the promulgating agency\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation of its objectives, and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s current views of the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s pre-emptive effect.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The history showed that the Department of Transportation (DOT) had long thought it important to leave manufacturers with a choice.  In 1967 DOT required manufacturers to install manual seat belts.  <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 875; 32 Fed. Reg. 2408, 2415 (1967).  Because many car occupants did not \xe2\x80\x9cbuckle up,\xe2\x80\x9d DOT began to require passive protection, such as airbags or automatic seatbelts, but without \xe2\x80\x9cfavor[ing] or \xe2\x80\x9cexpect[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the use of airbags.  <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 875 (internal quotation marks omitted); 35 Fed. Reg. 16927 (1970).  DOT subsequently approved the use of ignition interlocks, which froze the ignition until the occupant buckled the belt, as a substitute for passive restraints.  <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 876; 37 Fed. Reg. 3911 (1972).  But the interlock devices were unpopular with the public, and Congress soon forbade the agency to make them a means of compliance.  <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 876; Motor Vehicle and Schoolbus Safety Amendments of 1974, \xc2\xa7109, 88 Stat. 1482 (previously codified at 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71410(b) (1988 ed.)).  DOT then temporarily switched to the use of demonstration projects, but later it returned to mandating passive restraints, again leaving manufacturers with a choice of systems.  <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 876\xe2\x80\x93877; see 49 Fed. Reg. 28962 (1984).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>DOT\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation of its 1984 regulation made clear that manufacturer choice was an important means for achieving its basic objectives.  The 1984 regulation gradually phased in passive restraint requirements, initially requiring manufacturers to equip only 10% of their new fleets with passive restraints.  DOT explained that it intended its phasing period partly to give manufacturers time to improve airbag technology and to develop \xe2\x80\x9cother, better\xe2\x80\x9d passive restraint systems.  <em>Geier</em>, 529 U. S.,<em> </em>at 879.  DOT further explained that it had rejected an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98all airbag\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d system.  <em>Ibid</em>.<em> </em>It was worried that requiring airbags in most or all vehicles would cause a public backlash, like the backlash against interlock devices.  <em>Ibid.</em>  DOT also had concerns about the safety of airbags, for they could injure out-of-place occupants, particularly children.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 877\xe2\x80\x93878.  And, given the cost of airbags, vehicle owners might not replace them when necessary, leaving occupants without passive protection.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The regulation therefore \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberately sought variety\xe2\x80\x94a mix of several different passive restraint systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 878.  DOT hoped that this mix would lead to better information about the devices\xe2\x80\x99 comparative effectiveness and to the eventual development of \xe2\x80\x9calternative, cheaper, and safer passive restraint systems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 879.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Solicitor General told us that a tort suit that insisted upon use of airbags, as opposed to other federally permissible passive restraint systems, would \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of these objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 883 (quoting Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Geier </em>v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1999, No. 98\xe2\x80\x931811, pp.\xc2\xa025\xe2\x80\x9326 (hereinafter United States Brief in <em>Geier</em>) (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And we gave weight to the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s view in light of the fact that it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98embodie[d] the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s policy judgment that safety would best be promoted if manufacturers installed <em>alternative </em>protection systems in their fleets rather than one particular system in every car.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S., at 881 (quoting United States Brief in <em>Geier </em>25\xe2\x80\x9326).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Taken together, this history, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current understanding of the regulation convinced us that manufacturer choice was an important regulatory objective.  And since the tort suit stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment of that objective, we found the tort suit pre-empted.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to the present case.  Like the regulation in <em>Geier</em>,<em> </em>the regulation here leaves the manufacturer with a choice.  And, like the tort suit in <em>Geier</em>, the tort suit here would restrict that choice.  But unlike <em>Geier, </em>we do not believe here that choice is a significant regulatory objective.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We concede that the history of the regulation before us resembles the history of airbags to some degree.  In 1984, DOT rejected a regulation that would have required the use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear seats.  49 Fed. Reg. 15241.  Nonetheless, by 1989 when DOT promulgated the present regulation, it had \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that several factors had changed.\xe2\x80\x9d  54 Fed. Reg. 46258.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0DOT then required manufacturers to install a particular kind of belt, namely, lap-and-shoulder belts, for rear outer seats.  In respect to rear inner seats, it retained manufacturer choice as to which kind of belt to install.  But its 1989 reasons for retaining that choice differed considerably from its 1984 reasons for permitting manufacturers a choice in respect to airbags.  DOT here was not concerned about consumer acceptance; it was convinced that lap-and-shoulder belts would increase safety; it did not fear additional safety risks arising from use of those belts; it had\nno interest in assuring a mix of devices; and, though it\nwas concerned about additional costs, that concern was\ndiminishing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respect to consumer acceptance, DOT wrote that if</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cpeople who are familiar with and in the habit of wearing lap/shoulder belts in the front seat find lap/shoulder belts in the rear seat, it stands to reason that they would be more likely to wear those belts when riding in the rear seat.\xe2\x80\x9d  53 Fed. Reg. 47983 (1988).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In respect to safety, DOT wrote that, because an increasing number of rear seat passengers wore seatbelts, rear seat lap-and-shoulder belts would have \xe2\x80\x9cprogressively greater actual safety benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  54 Fed. Reg. 46257.</p>\n<p>\n\nIt added:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[s]tudies of occupant protection from 1968 forward show that the lap-only safety belts installed in rear seating positions are effective in reducing the risk of death and injury. . . . However, the agency believes that rear-seat lap/shoulder safety belts would be even more effective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Five years earlier, DOT had expressed concern that lap-and-shoulder belts might negatively impact child safety by interfering with the use of certain child car seats that relied upon a tether.  But by 1989, DOT found that car-seat designs \xe2\x80\x9chad shifted away\xe2\x80\x9d from tethers.  53 Fed. Reg. 47983.  And rear lap-and-shoulder belts could therefore offer safety benefits for children old enough to use them without diminishing the safety of smaller children in car seats.  <em>Id.</em>, at 47988\xe2\x80\x9347989 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he agency believes that this proposal for rear seat lap/shoulder belts would offer benefits for children riding in some types of booster seats, would have no positive or negative effects on children riding in most designs of car seats and children that are too small to use shoulder belts, and would offer older children the same incremental safety protection [as adults]\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor did DOT seek to use its regulation to spur the development of alternative kinds of rear aisle or middle seat safety devices.  See 54 Fed. Reg. 46257.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Why then did DOT not require lap-and-shoulder belts in these seats?  We have found some indication that it thought use of lap-and-shoulder belts in rear aisle seats could cause \xe2\x80\x9centry and exit problems for occupants of seating positions to the rear\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cstretch[ing] the shoulder belt across the aisleway,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 46258.  However, DOT encouraged manufacturers to address this issue through innovation:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n those cases where manufacturers are able to design and install lap/shoulder belts at seating positions adjacent to aisleways without interfering with the aisleway\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of allowing access to more rearward seating positions[, the agency] encourages the manufacturers to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  54 Fed. Reg. 46258.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd there is little indication that DOT considered this matter a significant safety concern.  Cf. Letter from Philip R. Recht, Chief Counsel, National Highway Traffic Safety Admin., to Roger Matoba (Dec. 28, 1994), App. to Reply Brief for Petitioners 2 (\xe2\x80\x9cWith respect to your concerns about the safety of shoulder safety belts which cross an aisle, I note that such belts do not in fact prevent rearward passengers from exiting the vehicle.  Such passengers may \xe2\x80\xa6 g[o] under or over the belt.  They may also move the belt aside\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The more important reason why DOT did not require lap-and-shoulder belts for rear inner seats was that it thought that this requirement would not be cost-effective.  The agency explained that it would be significantly more expensive for manufacturers to install lap-and-shoulder belts in rear middle and aisle seats than in seats next to the car doors.  <em>Ibid. </em> But that fact\xe2\x80\x94the fact that DOT made a negative judgment about cost effectiveness\xe2\x80\x94cannot by itself show that DOT sought to forbid common-law tort suits in which a judge or jury might reach a\ndifferent conclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, DOT did not believe that costs would remain frozen.  Rather it pointed out that costs were falling as manufacturers were \xe2\x80\x9cvoluntarily equipping more and more of their vehicles with rear seat lap/shoulder belts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em> For another thing, many, perhaps most, federal safety regulations embody some kind of cost-effectiveness judgment.  While an agency could base a decision to pre-empt on its cost-effectiveness judgment, we are satisfied that the rulemaking record at issue here discloses no such pre-emptive intent.  And to infer from the mere existence of such a cost-effectiveness judgment that the federal agency intends to bar States from imposing stricter standards would treat all such federal standards as if they were <em>maximum </em>standards, eliminating the possibility that the federal agency seeks only to set forth a <em>minimum </em>standard potentially supplemented through state tort law.  We cannot reconcile this consequence with a statutory saving clause that foresees the likelihood of a continued meaningful role for state tort law.  <em>Supra</em>,<em> </em>at 4<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Solicitor General tells us that DOT\xe2\x80\x99s regulation does not pre-empt this tort suit.  As in <em>Geier,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthe agency\xe2\x80\x99s own views should make a difference.\xe2\x80\x9d  529 U. S., at 883.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cCongress has delegated to DOT authority to implement the statute; the subject matter is technical; and the relevant history and background are complex and extensive.  The agency is likely to have a thorough understanding of its own regulation and its objectives and is \xe2\x80\x98uniquely qualified\xe2\x80\x99 to comprehend the likely impact of state requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThere is<em> \xe2\x80\x9c</em>no reason to suspect that the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s representation of DOT\xe2\x80\x99s views reflects anything other than \xe2\x80\x98the agency\xe2\x80\x99s fair and considered judgment on the matter.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 884 (quoting <em>Auer</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/452/index.html">519 U. S. 452</a>, 462 (1997)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither has DOT expressed inconsistent views on this subject.  In <em>Geier</em>,<em> </em>the Solicitor General pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9cstate tort law does not conflict with a federal \xe2\x80\x98minimum standard\xe2\x80\x99 merely because state law imposes a more stringent requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States Brief in <em>Geier </em>21 (citation omitted).  And the Solicitor General explained that a standard giving manufacturers \xe2\x80\x9cmultiple options for the design of\xe2\x80\x9d a device would not pre-empt a suit claiming that a manufacturer should have chosen one particular option, where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary did not determine that the availability of options was necessary to promote safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 22; see Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Wood</em> v. <em>General Motors</em> <em>Corp.</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1989, No. 89\xe2\x80\x9346, p.\xc2\xa015.  This last statement describes the present case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Geier</em>,<em> </em>then, the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s history, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation, and its consistently held interpretive views indicated that the regulation sought to maintain manufacturer choice in order to further significant regulatory objectives.  Here, these same considerations indicate the contrary.  We consequently conclude that, even though the state tort suit may restrict the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s choice, it does not \xe2\x80\x9cstan[d] as an obstacle to the accomplishment . . . of the full purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law.  <em>Hines</em>, 312 U.

In <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U.

The majority and dissent in <em>Geier </em>agreed that \xe2\x80\x9ca court should not find pre-emption too readily in the absence of clear evidence of a conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 885.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of this case and with its reasoning.  I write separately only to emphasize the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of an overreading of <em>Geier</em> that has developed since that opinion was issued.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Geier</em> does not stand, as the California Court of Appeal, 167 Cal.

As the United States notes, \xe2\x80\x9ca conflict results only when the Safety Act (or regulations implementing the Safety Act) does not just set out options for compliance, but also provides that the regulated parties must remain free to choose among those options.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 8.  In other words, the mere fact that an agency regulation allows manufacturers a choice between options is insufficient to justify implied pre-emption; courts should only find pre-emption where evidence exists that an agency has a regulatory objective\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.,</em> obtaining a mix of passive restraint mechanisms, as in <em>Geier</em>\xe2\x80\x94whose achievement depends on manufacturers having a choice between options.  A link between a regulatory objective and the need for manufacturer choice to achieve that objective is the lynchpin of implied pre-emption when there is a saving clause.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Absent strong indications from the agency that it needs manufacturers to have options in order to achieve a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant \xe2\x80\xa6 regulatory objective,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> ante</em>, at 5, state tort suits are not \xe2\x80\x9cobstacle[s] to the accomplishment \xe2\x80\xa6 of the full purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x9d of federal law, <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U.

I agree.  But I reach this result by a more direct route: the Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause, which speaks directly to this question and answers it.  See 49 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa730103(e).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The plain text of the Safety Act resolves this case.   Congress has instructed that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompliance with a motor vehicle safety standard prescribed under this chapter does not exempt a person from liability at common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  This saving clause \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly preserv[es] state common-law actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyeth</em> v. <em>Levine</em>, 555 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 18).  Here, Mazda complied with FMVSS 208 when it chose to install a simple lap belt.  According to Mazda, the Williamsons\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit alleging that it should have installed a lap-and-shoulder seatbelt instead is pre-empted.  That argument is foreclosed by the saving clause; the Williamsons\xe2\x80\x99 state tort action is not pre-empted.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority does not rely on the Safety Act\xe2\x80\x99s saving clause because this Court effectively read it out of the statute in <em>Geier</em> v. <em>American Honda Motor Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/861/index.html">529 U. S. 861</a> (2000).  In <em>Geier</em>, the Court interpreted the saving clause as simply cancelling out the statute\xe2\x80\x99s express pre-emption clause with respect to common-law tort actions.  This left the Court free to consider the effect of conflict pre-emption principles on such tort actions.  See <em>id.,</em> at 869.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But it makes no sense to read the express pre-emption clause in conjunction with the saving clause.  See <em>id.,</em> at 898 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  The express pre-emption clause bars States from having any safety \xe2\x80\x9cstandard applicable to the same aspect of performance\xe2\x80\x9d as a federal standard unless it is \xe2\x80\x9cidentical\xe2\x80\x9d to the federal one.   \xc2\xa730103(b).  That clause pre-empts States from establishing \xe2\x80\x9cobjective rule[s] prescribed by a legislature or an administrative agency\xe2\x80\x9d in competition with the federal standards; it says nothing about the tort lawsuits that are the focus of the saving clause.<em>  Id.,</em> at 896.*<footcall num="*">  Read independently of the express pre-emption clause,<em> </em>the saving clause simply means what it says: FMVSS 208 does not pre-empt state common-law actions.</footcall></p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As in <em>Geier</em>, rather than following the plain text of the statute, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis turns on whether the tort lawsuit here \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stands as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\nof FMVSS 208.   <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (quoting <em>Hines</em> v. <em>Davidowitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/312/52/index.html">312 U.

It instructs courts to pre-empt state laws based on judges\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconceptions of a policy which Congress has not expressed and which is not plainly to be inferred from the legislation which it has enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hines, supra,</em> at 75 (Stone, J., dissenting); <em>Geier</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 907 (opinion of Stevens, J.)

(recounting the history of the doctrine).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s purposes-and-objectives pre-emption analysis displays the inherent constitutional problem with the doctrine.  The Court begins with FMVSS 208, which allowed manufacturers to install either simple lap or lap-and-shoulder seatbelts in the rear aisle seat of 1993 minivans.  The majority then turns to what it considers the primary issue: whether \xe2\x80\x9cthat choice [was] a <em>significant </em>regulatory objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (emphasis added).  Put more plainly, the question is whether the regulators <em>really </em>wanted manufacturers to have a choice or did not really want them to have a choice but gave them one anyway.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To answer that question, the majority engages in a \xe2\x80\x9cfreewheeling, extratextual, and broad evaluatio[n] of the \xe2\x80\x98purposes and objectives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of FMVSS 208.  <em>Wyeth</em>,<em> supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 23) (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The Court wades into a sea of agency musings and Government litigating positions and fishes for what the agency may have been thinking 20 years ago when it drafted the relevant provision.  After scrutinizing the 1989 Federal Register, a letter written in 1994, and the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s present-day assurances, the Court finds that Department of Transportation liked the idea of lap-and-shoulder seatbelts in all seats, but did not require them, primarily for cost-efficiency reasons and also because of some concern for ingress-egress around the belt mounts.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  From all of this, the majority determines that although the regulators specifically and intentionally gave manufacturers a choice between types of seatbelts, that choice was not a \xe2\x80\x9csignificant regulatory objective\xe2\x80\x9d and so does not pre-empt state tort lawsuits.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the Court in <em>Geier </em>reached an opposite conclusion reveals the utterly unconstrained nature of purposes-and-objectives pre-emption.  There is certainly \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable similarity between this case and <em>Geier</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2.  Just as in this case, <em>Geier </em>involved a choice offered to car manufacturers in FMVSS 208: whether to install airbags.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  And just as in this case, the Court in <em>Geier </em>relied on \xe2\x80\x9chistory, the agency\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous explanation, and the Government\xe2\x80\x99s current understanding\xe2\x80\x9d to determine the significance of that choice.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Yet the <em>Geier </em>Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cgiving auto manufacturers a choice among different kinds of passive restraint devices was a <em>significant objective </em>of the federal regulation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6, and thus found the Geiers\xe2\x80\x99 lawsuit pre-empted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dispositive difference between this case and <em>Geier</em>\xe2\x80\x94indeed, the only difference\xe2\x80\x94is the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpsychoanalysis\xe2\x80\x9d of the regulators.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Public Util. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Cal.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/295/index.html">345 U. S. 295</a>, 319 (1953) (Jackson, J., concurring) (describing reliance on legislative history).  The majority cites no difference on the face of FMVSS 208 between the airbag choice addressed in <em>Geier</em> and the seatbelt choice at issue in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to the majority, to determine whether FMVSS 208 pre-empts a tort suit, courts apparently must embark on the same expedition undertaken here: sifting through the Federal Register, examining agency ruminations, and asking the Government what it currently thinks.  Pre-emption is then proper if the court decides that the regulators thought the choice especially important, but not if the choice was only somewhat important.  This quest roves far from the Safety Act and analyzes pre-emption based on a formless inquiry into how strongly an agency felt about the regulation it enacted 20 years ago.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[F]reeranging speculation about what the purposes of the [regulation] must have been\xe2\x80\x9d is not constitutionally proper in any case.  <em>Wyeth</em>, <em>supra,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 15) (opinion of Thomas, J.).  The Supremacy Clause commands that the \xe2\x80\x9c[l]aws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d not the unenacted hopes and dreams of the Department of Transportation, \xe2\x80\x9cshall be the supreme Law of the Land.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Art. VI, cl. 2.  The impropriety is even more obvious here because the plain text of the Safety Act resolves this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I concur in the judgment.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0See also <em>Sprietsma</em> v. <em>Mercury Marine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/51/index.html">537 U.
