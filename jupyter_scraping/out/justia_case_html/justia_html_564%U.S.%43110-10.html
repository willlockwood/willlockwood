For the first four, he was sentenced to 90 days\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, but he ultimately paid what he owed (twice without being jailed, twice after spending a few days in custody).  The fifth time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.  After his release, the family court clerk issued a new \xe2\x80\x9cshow cause\xe2\x80\x9d order against Turner because he was $5728.76 in arrears.  Both he and Rogers were unrepresented by counsel at his brief civil contempt hearing.  The judge found Turner in willful contempt and sentenced him to 12 months in prison without making any finding as to his ability to pay or indicating on the contempt order form whether he was able to make support payments.  After Turner completed his sentence, the South Carolina Supreme Court rejected his claim that the Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his contempt hearing, declaring that civil contempt does not require all the constitutional safeguards applicable in criminal contempt proceedings.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Even though Turner has completed his 12-month sentence, and there are not alleged to be collateral consequences of the contempt determination that might keep the dispute alive, this case is not moot, because it is \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition\xe2\x80\x9d while \xe2\x80\x9cevading review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Southern Pac. Terminal Co.</em> v. <em>Interstate Commerce Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/219/498/index.html">219 U. S. 498</a>, 515.  A case remains live if \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weinstein</em> v. <em>Bradford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/147/index.html">423 U.

Here, the \xe2\x80\x9cchallenged action,\xe2\x80\x9d Turner\xe2\x80\x99s imprisonment for up to 12 months, is \xe2\x80\x9cin its duration too short to be fully litigated\xe2\x80\x9d through the state courts (and arrive here) prior to its \xe2\x80\x9cexpiration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First Nat\xe2\x80\x99l Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html">435 U.

And there is a more than \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d likelihood that Turner will again be \xe2\x80\x9csubjected to the same action\xe2\x80\x9d because he has frequently failed to make his support payments, has been the subject of several civil contempt proceedings, has been imprisoned several times, and is, once again, the subject of civil contempt proceedings for failure to pay.  <em>DeFunis</em> v. <em>Odegaard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/312/index.html">416 U.

Pp. 5\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause does not <em>automatically</em> require the State to provide counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent noncustodial parent who is subject to a child support order, even if that individual faces incarceration.  In particular, that Clause does not require that counsel be provided where the opposing parent or other custodian is not represented by counsel and the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to adequate notice of the importance of the ability to pay, a fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and express court findings as to the supporting parent\xe2\x80\x99s ability to comply with the support order. Pp.  7\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents provide no definitive answer to the question whether counsel must be provided.  The Sixth Amendment grants an indigent criminal defendant the right to counsel, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/688/index.html">509 U. S. 688</a>, 696, but does not govern civil cases.  Civil and criminal contempt differ.  A court may not impose punishment \xe2\x80\x9cin a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/624/index.html">485 U. S. 624</a>, 638, n.\xc2\xa09.  And once a civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of the contempt and is free.  <em>Id.</em>, at 633.  The Due Process Clause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protections in civil contempt proceedings than in a criminal case.  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93641.  Cases directly concerning a right to counsel in civil cases have found a presumption of such a right \xe2\x80\x9c<em>only</em>\xe2\x80\x9d in cases involving incarceration, but have not held that a right to counsel exists in <em>all</em> such cases.  See <em>In\xc2\xa0re Gault</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/1/index.html">387 U. S. 1</a>; <em>Vitek</em> v. <em>Jones, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/index.html">445 U.

S. 319</a>, 335.  As relevant here those factors include (1) the nature of \xe2\x80\x9cthe private interest that will be affected,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the comparative \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous deprivation\xe2\x80\x9d of that interest with and without \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not providing \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural requirement[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cprivate interest that will be affected\xe2\x80\x9d argues strongly for the right to counsel here.  That interest consists of an indigent defendant\xe2\x80\x99s loss of personal liberty through imprisonment.  Freedom \xe2\x80\x9cfrom bodily restraint\xe2\x80\x9d lies \xe2\x80\x9cat the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foucha</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/71/index.html">504 U. S. 71</a>, 80.  Thus, accurate decisionmaking as to the \xe2\x80\x9cability to pay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which marks a dividing line between civil and criminal contempt, <em>Hicks, supra</em>, at 635, n. 7\xe2\x80\x94must be assured because an incorrect decision can result in a wrongful incarceration.  And because ability to comply divides civil and criminal contempt proceedings, an erroneous determination would also deprive a defendant of the procedural protections a criminal proceeding would demand.  Questions about ability to pay are likely to arise frequently in child custody cases.  On the other hand, due process does not always require the provision of counsel in civil proceedings where incarceration is threatened.  See <em>Gagnon </em>v. <em>Scarpelli, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/778/index.html">411 U. S. 778</a><em>.  </em>To<em> </em>determine whether a right to counsel is required here, opposing interests and the probable value of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards\xe2\x80\x9d must be taken into account.  <em>Mathews, supra</em>, at 335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doing so reveals three related considerations that, taken together, argue strongly against requiring counsel in every proceeding of the present kind.  First, the likely critical question in these cases is the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay, which is often closely related to his indigence and relatively straightforward.  Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by counsel but the custodial parent <em>un</em>represented by counsel.  A requirement that the State provide counsel to the noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation that would \xe2\x80\x9calter significantly the nature of the proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gagnon, supra</em>, at 787, creating a degree of formality or delay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need and make the proceedings <em>less</em> fair overall.  Third, as the Federal Government points out, an available set of \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute procedural safeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mathews, supra</em>, at 335, if employed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  These include (1) notice to the defendant that his \xe2\x80\x9cability to pay\xe2\x80\x9d is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information from him; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for him to respond to statements and questions about his financial status; and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This decision does not address civil contempt proceedings where the underlying support payment is owed to the State, <em>e.g.,</em> for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the custodial parent, or the question what due process requires in an unusually complex case where a defendant \xe2\x80\x9ccan fairly be represented only by a trained advocate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gagnon, supra</em>, at 788.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0Under the circumstances, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s incarceration violated due process because he received neither counsel nor the benefit of alternative procedures like those the Court describes. He did not have clear notice that his ability to pay would constitute the critical question in his civil contempt proceeding.  No one provided him with a form (or the equivalent) designed to elicit information about his financial circumstances.  And the trial court did not find that he was able to pay his arrearage, but nonetheless found him in civil contempt and ordered him incarcerated.

We must decide whether the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause requires the State to provide counsel (at a civil contempt hearing) to an <em>indigent</em> person potentially faced with such incarceration.  We conclude that where as here the custodial parent (entitled to receive the support) is unrepresented by counsel, the State need not provide counsel to the noncustodial parent (required to provide the support).  But we attach an important caveat, namely, that the State must nonetheless have in place alternative procedures that assure a fundamentally fair determination of the critical incarceration-related question, whether the supporting parent is able to comply with the support order.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0South Carolina family courts enforce their child support orders in part through civil contempt proceedings.  Each month the family court clerk reviews outstanding child support orders, identifies those in which the supporting parent has fallen more than five days behind, and sends that parent an order to \xe2\x80\x9cshow cause\xe2\x80\x9d why he should not be held in contempt.  S.\xc2\xa0C. Rule Family Ct. 24 (2011).  The \xe2\x80\x9cshow cause\xe2\x80\x9d order and attached affidavit refer to the relevant child support order, identify the amount of\nthe arrearage, and set a date for a court hearing.  At the hearing that parent may demonstrate that he is not in contempt, say, by showing that he is not able to make the required payments.  See <em>Moseley</em> v. <em>Mosier</em>, 279 S.\xc2\xa0C. 348, 351, 306 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 624, 626 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen the parent is <em>unable</em> to make the required payments, he is not in contempt\xe2\x80\x9d).  If he fails to make the required showing, the court may hold him in civil contempt.  And it may require that he be imprisoned unless and until he purges himself of contempt by making the required child support payments (but not for more than one year regardless).  See S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa763\xe2\x80\x933\xe2\x80\x93620 (Supp. 2010) (imprisonment for up to one year of \xe2\x80\x9cadult who wilfully violates\xe2\x80\x9d a court order); <em>Price</em> v. <em>Turner</em>, 387 S.\xc2\xa0C. 142, 145, 691 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 470, 472 (2010) (civil contempt order must permit purging of contempt through compliance).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In June 2003 a South Carolina family court entered an order, which (as amended) required petitioner, Michael Turner, to pay $51.73 per week to respondent, Rebecca Rogers, to help support their child.  (Rogers\xe2\x80\x99 father, Larry Price, currently has custody of the child and is also a respondent before this Court.)  Over the next three years, Turner repeatedly failed to pay the amount due and was held in contempt on five occasions.  The first four times he was sentenced to 90 days\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, but he ultimately paid the amount due (twice without being jailed, twice after spending two or three days in custody).  The fifth time he did not pay but completed a 6-month sentence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After his release in 2006 Turner remained in arrears.  On March 27, 2006, the clerk issued a new \xe2\x80\x9cshow cause\xe2\x80\x9d order.  And after an initial postponement due to Turner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to appear, Turner\xe2\x80\x99s civil contempt hearing took place on January 3, 2008.  Turner and Rogers were present, each without representation by counsel.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The hearing was brief.  The court clerk said that Turner was $5,728.76 behind in his payments.  The judge asked Turner if there was \xe2\x80\x9canything you want to say.\xe2\x80\x9d  Turner replied,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWell, when I first got out, I got back on dope.  I done meth, smoked pot and everything else, and I paid a little bit here and there.  And, when I finally did get to working, I broke my back, back in September.  I filed for disability and SSI.  And, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get straightened out off the dope until I broke my back and laid up for two months.  And, now I\xe2\x80\x99m off the dope and everything.  I just hope that you give me a chance.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what else to say.  I mean, I know I done wrong, and I should have been paying and helping her, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sorry.  I mean, dope had a hold to me.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 17a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe judge then said, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]kay,\xe2\x80\x9d and asked Rogers if she had anything to say.  <em>Ibid.</em>  After a brief discussion of federal benefits, the judge stated,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing else, this will be the Order of\nthe Court.  I find the Defendant in willful contempt.  I\xe2\x80\x99m [going to] sentence him to twelve months in the Oconee County Detention Center.  He may purge himself of the contempt and avoid the sentence by having a zero balance on or before his release.  I\xe2\x80\x99ve also placed a lien on any SSI or other benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 18a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe judge added that Turner would not receive good-time or work credits, but \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f you\xe2\x80\x99ve got a job, I\xe2\x80\x99ll make you eligible for work release.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  When Turner asked why he could not receive good-time or work credits, the judge said, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]ecause that\xe2\x80\x99s my ruling.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court made no express finding concerning Turner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay his arrearage (though Turner\xe2\x80\x99s wife had voluntarily submitted a copy of Turner\xe2\x80\x99s application for disability benefits, cf. <em>post</em>, at 7, n.\xc2\xa03 (Thomas, J., dissenting); App. 135a\xe2\x80\x93136a).  Nor did the judge ask any followup questions or otherwise address the ability-to-pay issue.  After the hearing, the judge filled out a prewritten form titled \xe2\x80\x9cOrder for Contempt of Court,\xe2\x80\x9d which included the statement:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cDefendant (was) (was not) gainfully employed and/or (had) (did not have) the ability to make these support payments when due.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 60a, 61a.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut the judge left this statement as is without indicating whether Turner was able to make support payments.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While serving his 12-month sentence, Turner, with the help of <em>pro bono </em>counsel, appealed.  He claimed that\nthe Federal Constitution entitled him to counsel at his con- tempt hearing.  The South Carolina Supreme Court decided Turner\xe2\x80\x99s appeal after he had completed his sentence.  And it rejected his \xe2\x80\x9cright to counsel\xe2\x80\x9d claim.  The court pointed out that civil contempt differs significantly from criminal contempt.  The former does not require all the \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional safeguards\xe2\x80\x9d applicable in criminal proceedings.  387 S.\xc2\xa0C., at 145, 691 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 472.

A dispute falls into that category, and a case based on that dispute remains live, if \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the challenged action [is] in its duration too short to be fully litigated prior to its cessation or expiration, and (2) there [is] a reasonable expectation that the same complaining party [will] be subjected to the same action again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weinstein</em> v. <em>Bradford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/147/index.html">423 U.

At the same time, there is a more than \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d likelihood that Turner will again be \xe2\x80\x9csubjected to the same action.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have pointed out, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 2\xe2\x80\x933, Turner has frequently failed to make his child support payments.  He has been the subject of several civil contempt proceedings.  He has been imprisoned on several of those occasions.  Within months of his release from the imprisonment here at issue he was again the subject of civil contempt proceedings.  And he was again imprisoned, this time for six months.  As of December 9, 2010, Turner was $13,814.72 in arrears, and another contempt hearing was scheduled for May 4, 2011.  App. 104a; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3, n.\xc2\xa01.  These facts bring this case squarely within the special category of cases that are not moot because the underlying dispute\nis \xe2\x80\x9ccapable of repetition, yet evading review.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Nebraska Press Assn.</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/539/index.html">427 U. S. 539</a>, 546\xe2\x80\x93547 (1976) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the underlying facts make this case unlike <em>DeFunis</em> v. <em>Odegaard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/416/312/index.html">416 U. S. 312</a> (1974) <em>(per curiam)</em>, and <em>St. Pierre</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/319/41/index.html">319 U. S. 41</a> (1943) <em>(per curiam)</em>, two cases that respondents believe require us to find this case moot regardless.  <em>DeFunis </em>was moot, but that is because the plaintiff himself was unlikely to again suffer the conduct of which he complained (and others likely to suffer from that conduct could bring their own lawsuits).  Here petitioner himself <em>is </em>likely to suffer future imprisonment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>St. Pierre</em> was moot because the petitioner (a witness held in contempt and sentenced to five months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment) had failed to \xe2\x80\x9capply to this Court for a stay\xe2\x80\x9d of the federal-court order imposing imprisonment.  319 U. S., at 42\xe2\x80\x9343.  And, like the witness in <em>St. Pierre, </em>Turner did not seek a stay of the contempt order requiring his imprisonment.  But this case, unlike <em>St. Pierre, </em>arises out of a state-court proceeding.  And respondents give us no reason to believe that we would have (or that we could have) granted a timely request for a stay had one been made.\nCf. 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71257 (granting this Court jurisdiction to review <em>final </em>state-court judgments).  In <em>Sibron</em>,<em> </em>we rejected a similar \xe2\x80\x9cmootness\xe2\x80\x9d argument for just that reason.  392 U. S., at 53, n.\xc2\xa013.  And we find this case similar in this respect to <em>Sibron, </em>not to <em>St. Pierre</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must decide whether the Due Process Clause grants an indigent defendant, such as Turner, a right to state-appointed counsel at a civil contempt proceeding, which may lead to his incarceration.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents provide no definitive answer to that question.  This Court has long held that the Sixth Amendment grants an indigent defendant the right to state-appointed counsel in\na <em>criminal </em>case.  <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a> (1963).  And we have held that this same rule applies to <em>criminal contempt</em> proceedings (other than summary proceedings).  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Dixon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/688/index.html">509 U. S. 688</a>, 696 (1993); <em>Cooke</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/267/517/index.html">267 U. S. 517</a>, 537 (1925).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Sixth Amendment does not govern civil cases.  Civil contempt differs from criminal contempt in that it seeks only to \xe2\x80\x9ccoerc[e] the defendant to do\xe2\x80\x9d what a court had previously ordered him to do.<em>  Gompers</em> v. <em>Bucks Stove &amp; Range Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/221/418/index.html">221 U. S. 418</a>, 442 (1911).  A court may not impose punishment \xe2\x80\x9cin a civil contempt proceeding when it is clearly established that the alleged contemnor is unable to comply with the terms of the order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hicks </em>v. <em>Feiock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/485/624/index.html">485 U. S. 624</a>, 638, n.\xc2\xa09 (1988).  And once a civil contemnor complies with the underlying order, he is purged of the contempt and is free.  <em>Id.</em>, at 633 (he \xe2\x80\x9ccarr[ies] the keys of [his] prison in [his] own pockets\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, the Court has made clear (in a case not involving the right to counsel) that, where civil contempt is at issue, the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause allows a State to provide fewer procedural protections than in a criminal case.  <em>Id.</em>, at 637\xe2\x80\x93641 (State may place the burden of proving inability to pay on the defendant).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court has decided only a handful of cases that more directly concern a right to counsel in civil matters.  And the application of those decisions to the present case is not clear.  On the one hand, the Court has held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires the State to pay for representation by counsel in<em> </em>a <em>civil</em> \xe2\x80\x9cjuvenile delinquency\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding (which could lead to incarceration).  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Gault</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/1/index.html">387 U. S. 1</a>, 35\xe2\x80\x9342 (1967).  Moreover, in <em>Vitek</em> v. <em>Jones,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/index.html">445 U. S. 480</a>, 496\xe2\x80\x93497 (1980), a plurality of four Members of this Court would have held that the Fourteenth Amendment requires representation by counsel in a proceeding to transfer a prison inmate to a state hospital for the mentally ill.  Further, in <em>Lassiter</em> v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of Durham Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/index.html">452 U. S. 18</a> (1981), a case that focused upon civil proceedings leading to loss of parental rights, the Court wrote that the</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cpre-eminent generalization that emerges from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents on an indigent\xe2\x80\x99s right to appointed counsel is that such a right has been recognized to exist only where the litigant may lose his physical liberty if he loses the litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAnd the Court then drew from these precedents \xe2\x80\x9cthe presumption that an indigent litigant has a right to appointed counsel only when, if he loses, he may be deprived of his physical liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, the Court has held that a criminal offender facing revocation of probation and imprisonment does <em>not </em>ordinarily have a right to counsel at a probation revocation hearing.  <em>Gagnon</em> v. <em>Scarpelli</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/778/index.html"></a><a href="/us/411/778/index.html">411 U. S. 778</a> (1973); see also<em> Middendorf</em> v. <em>Henry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/25/index.html">425 U. S. 25</a> (1976) (no due process right to counsel in summary court-martial proceedings). And, at the same time, <em>Gault, Vitek, </em>and <em>Lassiter </em>are readily distinguishable.  The civil juvenile delinquency proceeding at issue in <em>Gault</em> was \xe2\x80\x9clittle different\xe2\x80\x9d from, and \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable in seriousness\xe2\x80\x9d to, a criminal prosecution.  387 U. S., at 28, 36.  In <em>Vitek,</em> the controlling opinion found <em>no</em> right to counsel.  445 U. S., at 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (Powell, J., concurring in part) (assistance of mental health professionals sufficient).  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s statements in <em>Lassiter </em>constitute part of its rationale for <em>denying</em> a right to counsel in that case.  We believe those statements are best read as pointing out that the Court previously had found a right to counsel \xe2\x80\x9c<em>only</em>\xe2\x80\x9d in cases involving incarceration, not that a right to counsel exists in <em>all</em> such cases (a position that would have been difficult to reconcile with <em>Gagnon</em>).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Civil contempt proceedings in child support cases con-\nstitute one part of a highly complex system designed to assure a noncustodial parent\xe2\x80\x99s regular payment of funds typically necessary for the support of his children.  Often the family receives welfare support from a state-administered federal program, and the State then seeks reimbursement from the noncustodial parent.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7608(a)(3) (2006 ed., Supp. III), 656(a)(1) (2006 ed.); S.\xc2\xa0C. Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa743\xe2\x80\x935\xe2\x80\x9365(a)(1), (2) (2010 Cum. Supp.).  Other times the custodial parent (often the mother, but sometimes the father, a grandparent, or another person with custody) does not receive government benefits and is entitled to receive the support payments herself.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Federal Government has created an elaborate procedural mechanism designed to help both the government and custodial parents to secure the payments to which they are entitled.  See generally <em>Blessing</em> v. <em>Freestone</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/329/index.html">520 U. S. 329</a>, 333 (1997) (describing the \xe2\x80\x9cinterlocking set of cooperative federal-state welfare programs\xe2\x80\x9d as they relate to child support enforcement); 45 CFR pt. 303 (2010) (prescribing standards for state child support agencies).  These systems often rely upon wage withholding, expedited procedures for modifying and enforcing child support orders, and automated data processing.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7666(a), (b), 654(24).  But sometimes States will use contempt orders to ensure that the custodial parent receives support payments or the government receives reimbursement.  Although some experts have criticized this last-mentioned procedure, and the Federal Government believes that \xe2\x80\x9cthe routine use of contempt for non-payment of child support is likely to be an ineffective strategy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government also tells us that \xe2\x80\x9ccoercive enforcement remedies, such as contempt, have a role to play.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 21\xe2\x80\x9322, and n.\xc2\xa08 (citing Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Child Support Enforcement, Strategic Plan: FY 2005\xe2\x80\x932009, pp. 2, 10).  South Carolina, which relies heavily on contempt proceedings, agrees that they are an important tool.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We here consider an indigent\xe2\x80\x99s right to paid counsel at such a contempt proceeding.  It is a civil proceeding.  And we consequently determine the \xe2\x80\x9cspecific dictates of due process\xe2\x80\x9d by examining the \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct factors\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court has previously found useful in deciding what specific safeguards the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause re-quires in order to make a civil proceeding fundamentally fair.  <em>Mathews</em> v. <em>Eldridge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/319/index.html">424 U. S. 319</a>, 335 (1976) (considering fairness of an administrative proceeding).  As relevant here those factors include (1) the nature of \xe2\x80\x9cthe private interest that will be affected,\xe2\x80\x9d (2) the comparative \xe2\x80\x9crisk\xe2\x80\x9d of an \xe2\x80\x9cerroneous deprivation\xe2\x80\x9d of that interest with and without \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d and (3) the nature and magnitude of any countervailing interest in not providing \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural requirement[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>Lassiter</em>, 452 U. S., at 27\xe2\x80\x9331 (applying the <em>Mathews</em> framework).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cprivate interest that will be affected\xe2\x80\x9d argues strongly for the right to counsel that Turner advocates.  That interest consists of an indigent defendant\xe2\x80\x99s loss of personal liberty through imprisonment.  The interest in securing that freedom, the freedom \xe2\x80\x9cfrom bodily restraint,\xe2\x80\x9d lies \xe2\x80\x9cat the core of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Foucha</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/71/index.html">504 U. S. 71</a>, 80 (1992).  And we have made clear that its threatened loss through legal proceedings demands \xe2\x80\x9cdue process protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Addington</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/441/418/index.html">441 U. S. 418</a>, 425 (1979).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the importance of the interest at stake, it is ob-viously important to assure accurate decisionmaking in respect to the key \xe2\x80\x9cability to pay\xe2\x80\x9d question.  Moreover, the fact that ability to comply marks a dividing line between civil and criminal contempt, <em>Hicks</em>, 485 U. S., at 635, n. 7, reinforces the need for accuracy.  That is because an incorrect decision (wrongly classifying the contempt proceeding as civil) can increase the risk of wrongful incarceration by depriving the defendant of the procedural protections (including counsel) that the Constitution would demand in a criminal proceeding.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Dixon</em>, 509 U. S., at 696 (proof beyond a reasonable doubt, protection from double jeopardy); <em>Codispoti</em> v. <em>Pennsylvania</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/506/index.html">418 U. S. 506</a>, 512\xe2\x80\x93513, 517 (1974) (jury trial where the result is more than six months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment).  And since 70% of child support arrears nationwide are owed by parents with either no reported income or income of $10,000 per year or less, the issue of ability to pay may arise fairly often.  See\nE. Sorensen, L. Sousa, &amp; S. Schaner, Assessing Child Support Arrears in Nine Large States and the Nation\n22 (2007) (prepared by The Urban Institute), online at http://aspe.hhs.gov/hsp/07/assessing-CS-debt/report.pdf (as visited June 16, 2011, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); <em>id.</em>, at 23 (\xe2\x80\x9cresearch suggests that many obligors who do not have reported quarterly wages have relatively limited resources\xe2\x80\x9d); Patterson, Civil Contempt and the Indigent Child Support Obligor: The Silent Return of Debtor\xe2\x80\x99s Prison, 18 Cornell J.\xc2\xa0L. &amp; Pub.

See <em>Gagnon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/778/index.html"></a><a href="/us/411/778/index.html">411 U. S. 778</a>.  And in determining whether the Clause requires a right to counsel here, we must take account of opposing interests, as well as consider the probable value of \xe2\x80\x9cadditional or substitute procedural safeguards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mathews</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 335.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Doing so, we find three related considerations that, when taken together, argue strongly against the Due Process Clause requiring the State to provide indigents with counsel in every proceeding of the kind before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the critical question likely at issue in these cases concerns, as we have said, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pay.  That question is often closely related to the question of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s indigence.  But when the right procedures are in place, indigence can be a question that in many\xe2\x80\x94but not all\xe2\x80\x94cases is sufficiently straightforward to warrant determination <em>prior </em>to providing a defendant with counsel, even in a criminal case.  Federal law, for example, requires a criminal defendant to provide information showing that he is indigent, and therefore entitled to state-funded counsel, <em>before</em> he can receive that assistance.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73006A(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, sometimes, as here, the person opposing the defendant at the hearing is not the government represented by counsel but the custodial parent <em>un</em>represented by counsel.  See Dept. of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement, Understanding Child Support Debt: A Guide to Exploring Child Support Debt in Your State 5, 6 (2004) (51% of nationwide arrears, and 58% in South Carolina, are not owed to the government).  The custodial parent, perhaps a woman with custody of one or more children, may be relatively poor, unemployed, and unable to afford counsel.  Yet she may have encouraged the court to enforce its order through contempt.  Cf. Tr. Contempt Proceedings (Sept. 14, 2005), App. 44a\xe2\x80\x9345a (Rogers asks court, in light of pattern of nonpayment, to confine Turner).  She may be able to provide the court with significant information. Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 41a\xe2\x80\x9343a (Rogers describes where Turner lived and worked).  And the proceeding is ultimately for her benefit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A requirement that the State provide counsel to the noncustodial parent in these cases could create an asymmetry of representation that would \xe2\x80\x9calter significantly the nature of the proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gagnon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 787.  Doing so could mean a degree of formality or delay that would unduly slow payment to those immediately in need.  And, perhaps more important for present purposes, doing so could make the proceedings <em>less</em> fair overall, increasing the risk of a decision that would erroneously deprive a family of the support it is entitled to receive.  The needs of such families play an important role in our analysis.  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Thomas, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, as the Solicitor General points out, there is available a set of \xe2\x80\x9csubstitute procedural safeguards,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mathews</em>, 424 U. S., at 335, which, if employed together, can significantly reduce the risk of an erroneous deprivation of liberty.  They can do so, moreover, without incurring some of the drawbacks inherent in recognizing an automatic right to counsel.  Those safeguards include (1) notice to the de-fendant that his \xe2\x80\x9cability to pay\xe2\x80\x9d is a critical issue in the contempt proceeding; (2) the use of a form (or the equivalent) to elicit relevant financial information; (3) an opportunity at the hearing for the defendant to respond to statements and questions about his financial status, (<em>e.g.</em>, those triggered by his responses on the form); and (4) an express finding by the court that the defendant has the ability to pay.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 26\xe2\x80\x9327; Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> 23\xe2\x80\x9325.  In presenting these alternatives, the Government draws upon considerable experience in helping to manage statutorily mandated federal-state efforts to enforce child support orders.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10.  It does not claim that they are the only possible alternatives, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases suggest, for example, that sometimes assistance other than purely legal assistance (here, say, that of a neutral social worker) can prove constitutionally sufficient.  Cf. <em>Vitek</em>, 445 U. S., at 499\xe2\x80\x93500 (Powell, J., concurring in part) (provision of mental health professional).  But the Government does claim that these alternatives can assure the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental fairness\xe2\x80\x9d of the proceeding even where the State does not pay for counsel for an indigent defendant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While recognizing the strength of Turner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments, we ultimately believe that the three considerations we have just discussed must carry the day.  In our view, a categorical right to counsel in proceedings of the kind before us would carry with it disadvantages (in the form of unfairness and delay) that, in terms of ultimate fairness, would deprive it of significant superiority over the alternatives that we have mentioned.  We consequently hold that the Due Process Clause does not <em>automatically</em> require the provision of counsel at civil contempt proceedings to an indigent individual who is subject to a child support order, even if that individual faces incarceration (for up to a year).  In particular, that Clause does not require the provision of counsel where the opposing parent or other custodian (to whom support funds are owed) is not represented by counsel and the State provides alternative procedural safeguards equivalent to those we have mentioned (adequate notice of the importance of ability to pay, fair opportunity to present, and to dispute, relevant information, and court findings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not address civil contempt proceedings where the underlying child support payment is owed to the State, for example, for reimbursement of welfare funds paid to the parent with custody.  See <em>supra</em>, at 10.  Those proceedings more closely resemble debt-collection proceedings.  The government is likely to have counsel or some other competent representative.  Cf. <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Zerbst</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/458/index.html">304 U. S. 458</a>, 462\xe2\x80\x93463 (1938) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he average defendant does not have the professional legal skill to protect himself when brought before a tribunal with power to take his life or liberty, <em>wherein the prosecution is presented by experienced and learned counsel</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).

The court did not find that Turner was able to pay his arrearage, but instead left the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cfinding\xe2\x80\x9d section of the contempt order blank.

No one contends that South Carolina law entitles Turner to appointed counsel.  Nor does any federal statute or constitutional provision so provide.  Although the Sixth Amendment secures a right to \xe2\x80\x9cthe Assistance of Counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d it does\nnot apply here because civil contempt proceedings are not \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutions.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.

Moreover, as originally understood, the Sixth Amendment guaranteed only the \xe2\x80\x9cright to employ counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d; it did not require the court to appoint counsel in any circumstance.  <em>Padilla</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, 559 U.

Indeed, Turner concedes that contempt proceedings without appointed counsel have the blessing of history.

Such\na reading would render the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\xe2\x80\x94as it is currently understood\xe2\x80\x94superfluous.  Moreover, it appears that even cases applying the Court\xe2\x80\x99s modern interpretation of due process have not understood it to categorically require appointed counsel in circumstances outside those otherwise covered by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s current jurisprudence, the Sixth Amendment entitles indigent defendants to appointed coun- sel in felony cases and other criminal cases resulting\nin a sentence of imprisonment.  See <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U.

Turner concedes that, even under these cases, the Sixth Amendment does not entitle him to appointed counsel.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 12 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9ccivil contempt is not a \xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x99 within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  He argues instead that \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to the assistance of counsel for persons facing incarceration arises not only from the Sixth Amendment, but also from the requirement of fundamental fairness under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 28.  In his view, this Court has relied on due process to \xe2\x80\x9crejec[t] formalistic distinctions between criminal and civil proceedings, instead concluding that incarceration or other confinement triggers the right to counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 33.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But if the Due Process Clause created a right to appointed counsel in all proceedings with the potential for detention, then the Sixth Amendment right to appointed counsel would be unnecessary.  Under Turner\xe2\x80\x99s theory, every instance in which the Sixth Amendment guarantees a right to appointed counsel is covered also by the Due Process Clause.  The Sixth Amendment, however, is the only constitutional provision that even mentions the assistance of counsel; the Due Process Clause says nothing about counsel.  Ordinarily, we do not read a general provision to render a specific one superfluous.  Cf. <em>Morales</em> v. <em>Trans World Airlines, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/374/index.html">504 U. S. 374</a>, 384 (1992)\n(\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is a commonplace of statutory construction that the specific governs the general\xe2\x80\x9d).  The fact that one constitutional provision expressly provides a right to appointed counsel in specific circumstances indicates that the Constitution does not also <em>sub silentio</em> provide that right far more broadly in another, more general, provision.  Cf. <em>Albright</em> v. <em>Oliver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/266/index.html">510 U. S. 266</a>, 273 (1994) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere a particular Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of \xe2\x80\x98substantive due process,\xe2\x80\x99 must be the guide for analyzing these claims\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>id.,</em> at 281 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI agree with the plurality that an allegation of arrest without probable cause must be analyzed under the Fourth Amendment without reference to more general considerations of due process\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection</em>, 560 U.

The Court has never found in the Due Process Clause a categorical right to appointed counsel outside of criminal prosecutions or proceedings \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally akin to a criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gag-non</em> v. <em>Scarpelli</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/778/index.html">411 U.

This is consistent with the conclusion that the Due Process Clause does not expand the right to counsel beyond the boundaries set by the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After countless factors weighed, mores evaluated, and practices surveyed, the Court has not determined that due process principles of fundamental fairness categorically require counsel in any context outside criminal proceedings.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Lassiter</em> v. <em>Department of Social Servs. of Durham Cty.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/18/index.html">452 U.

Even when the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liberty is at stake, the Court has not concluded that fundamental fairness requires that counsel always be appointed if the proceeding is not criminal.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Scarpelli</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 790 (probation revocation); <em>Middendorf</em> v. <em>Henry</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/25/index.html">425 U.

S. 480</a>, 497\xe2\x80\x93500 (1980) (Powell, J., controlling opinion concurring in part) (transfer of prisoner to mental hospital).  Indeed, the only circumstance in which the Court has found that due process categorically requires appointed counsel is juvenile delinquency proceedings, which the Court has described as \xe2\x80\x9cfunctionally akin to a criminal trial.\xe2\x80\x9d   <em>Scarpelli</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 789, n. 12 (discussing <em>In\xc2\xa0re Gault</em>, <em>supra</em>); see <em>ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite language in its opinions that suggests it could find otherwise, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s consistent judgment has been that fundamental fairness does not categorically require appointed counsel in any context outside of criminal\nproceedings.  The majority is correct, therefore, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent does not require appointed counsel in the absence of a deprivation of liberty.  <em>Id</em>., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  But a more complete description of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases is that even when liberty is at stake, the Court has required appointed counsel in a category of cases only where it would have found the Sixth Amendment required it\xe2\x80\x94in criminal prosecutions.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority agrees that the Constitution does not entitle Turner to appointed counsel.

In some cases, the Court properly affirms a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on an alternative ground or accepts the persuasive argument of an <em>amicus</em> on a question that the parties have raised.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Tinklenberg</em>, 563 U. S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 13).

Rev. 420, 423 (2001) (finding that children whose fathers reside apart from them are 54 percent more likely to live in poverty than their fathers).  Nonpayment or inadequate payment can press children and mothers into poverty.  M. Garrison, The Goals and Limits of Child Support Policy, in Child Support: The Next Frontier 16 (J. Oldham &amp; M.

For example, Virginia, which uses civil contempt as\n\xe2\x80\x9ca last resort,\xe2\x80\x9d reports that in 2010 \xe2\x80\x9cdeadbeats\xe2\x80\x9d paid approximately $13 million \xe2\x80\x9ceither before a court hearing\nto avoid a contempt finding or after a court hearing to purge the contempt finding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 13a\xe2\x80\x9314a.

After the family court imposed Turner\xe2\x80\x99s weekly support obligation in June 2003, he made no payments until the court held him in contempt three months later, whereupon he paid over $1,000 to avoid confinement.  App. 17a\xe2\x80\x9318a, 131a.

Nor do I address the wisdom of\nthe State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to use certain methods of enforcement.  Whether \xe2\x80\x9cdeadbeat dads\xe2\x80\x9d should be threatened with incarceration is a policy judgment for state and federal lawmakers, as is the entire question of government involvement in the area of child support.  See Elrod &amp; Dale, Paradigm Shifts and Pendulum Swings in Child Custody, 42 Fam.

This and other repercussions of the shift away from the nuclear family are ultimately the business of the policymaking branches.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, D.
