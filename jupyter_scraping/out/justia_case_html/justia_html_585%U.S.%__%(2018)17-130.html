One way it can do so is by instituting an administrative proceeding against an alleged wrongdoer.  Typically, the Commission delegates the task of presiding over such a proceeding to an administrative law judge (ALJ).  The SEC currently has five ALJs.  Other staff members, rather than the Commission proper, selected them all.  An ALJ assigned to hear an SEC enforcement action has the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority to do all things necessary and appropriate\xe2\x80\x9d to ensure a \xe2\x80\x9cfair and orderly\xe2\x80\x9d adversarial proceeding.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201.111, 200.14(a).  After a hearing ends, the ALJ issues an initial decision.  The Commission can review that decision, but if it opts against review, it issues an order that the initial decision has become final.  See \xc2\xa7201.360(d).  The initial decision is then \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed the action of the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(c).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The SEC charged petitioner Raymond Lucia with violating certain securities laws and assigned ALJ Cameron Elliot to adjudicate the case.  Following a hearing, Judge Elliot issued an initial decision concluding that Lucia had violated the law and imposing sanctions.  On appeal to the SEC, Lucia argued that the administrative proceeding was invalid because Judge Elliot had not been constitutionally appointed.  According to Lucia, SEC ALJs are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and thus subject to the Appointments Clause.  Under that Clause, only the President, \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Law,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHeads of Departments\xe2\x80\x9d can appoint such \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers.\xe2\x80\x9d  But none of those actors had made Judge Elliot an ALJ.  The SEC and the Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C.

To qualify as an officer, rather than an employee, an individual must occupy a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing\xe2\x80\x9d position established by law, <i>Germaine, </i>99 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 511, and must \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Buckley</i>, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 126.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">In <i>Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner,</i>\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868, the Court applied this framework to \xe2\x80\x9cspecial trial judges\xe2\x80\x9d (STJs) of the United States Tax Court.  STJs could issue the final decision of the Tax Court in \xe2\x80\x9ccomparatively narrow and minor matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 873.  In more major matters, they could preside over the hearing but could not issue a final decision.  Instead, they were to \xe2\x80\x9cprepare proposed findings and an opinion\xe2\x80\x9d for a regular Tax Court judge to consider.  <i>Ibid.</i>  The proceeding challenged in <i>Freytag</i> was a major one.  The losing parties argued on appeal that the STJ who presided over their hearing was not constitutionally appointed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This Court held that STJs are officers.  Citing <i>Germaine</i>, the <i>Freytag </i>Court first found that STJs hold a continuing office established by law.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881.  The Court then considered, as <i>Buckley</i> demands, the \xe2\x80\x9csignificance\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d STJs wield.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881.  The Government had argued that STJs are employees in all cases in which they could not enter a final decision.  But the Court thought that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s focus on finality \xe2\x80\x9cignore[d] the significance of the duties and discretion that [STJs] possess.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Describing the responsibilities involved in presiding over adversarial hearings, the Court said: STJs \xe2\x80\x9ctake testimony, conduct trials, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and have the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 881\xe2\x80\x93882.  And the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the course of carrying out these important functions,\xe2\x80\x9d STJs \xe2\x80\x9cexercise significant discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 882.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F"><i>Freytag</i>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis decides this case.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs, like the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs, hold a continuing office established by law.  SEC ALJs \xe2\x80\x9creceive[\xc2\xa0] a career appointment,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 CFR \xc2\xa7930.204(a), to a position created by statute, see<i> </i>5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7556\xe2\x80\x93557, 5372, 3105.  And they exercise the same \xe2\x80\x9csignificant discretion\xe2\x80\x9d when carrying out the same \xe2\x80\x9cimportant functions\xe2\x80\x9d as STJs do.  <i>Freytag</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  Both sets of officials have all the authority needed to ensure fair and orderly adversarial hearings\xe2\x80\x94indeed, nearly all the tools of federal trial judges.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs, like the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs, \xe2\x80\x9ctake testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconduct trials,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9crule on the admissibility of evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chave the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 881\xe2\x80\x93882.  So point for point from <i>Freytag</i>\xe2\x80\x99s list, SEC ALJs have equivalent duties and powers as STJs in conducting adversarial inquiries.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Moreover, at the close of those proceedings, SEC ALJs issue decisions much like that in <i>Freytag</i>.  STJs prepare proposed findings and an opinion adjudicating charges and assessing tax liabilities.  Similarly, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs issue initial decisions containing factual findings, legal conclusions, and appropriate remedies.  And what happens next reveals that the ALJ can play the more autonomous role.  In a major Tax Court case, a regular Tax Court judge must always review an STJ\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and that opinion comes to nothing unless the regular judge adopts it.  By contrast, the SEC can decide against reviewing an ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision, and when it does so the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision itself \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes final\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed the action of the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 CFR \xc2\xa7201.360(d)(2);\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(c).

Lucia made just such a timely challenge.  And the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d remedy for an adjudication tainted with an appointments violation is a new \xe2\x80\x9chearing before a properly appointed\xe2\x80\x9d official.  <i>Id.</i>, at 183, 188.  In this case, that official cannot be Judge Elliot, even if he has by now received a constitutional appointment.  Having already both heard Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s case and issued an initial decision on the merits, he cannot be expected to consider the matter as though he had not adjudicated it before.  To cure the constitutional error, another ALJ (or the Commission itself) must hold the new hearing.

The SEC currently has five ALJs.  Other staff members, rather than the Commission proper, selected them all.

Those powers \xe2\x80\x9cinclude, but are not limited to,\xe2\x80\x9d supervising discovery; issuing, revoking, or modifying subpoenas; deciding motions; ruling on the admissibility of evidence; administering oaths; hearing and examining witnesses; generally \xe2\x80\x9c[r]egulating the course of\xe2\x80\x9d the proceeding and the \xe2\x80\x9cconduct of the parties and their counsel\xe2\x80\x9d; and imposing sanctions for \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontemptuous conduct\xe2\x80\x9d or violations of procedural requirements.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201.111, 201.180; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7200.14(a), 201.230.  As that list suggests, an SEC ALJ exercises authority \xe2\x80\x9ccomparable to\xe2\x80\x9d that of a federal district judge conducting a bench trial.  <i>Butz</i> v. <i>Economou</i>,438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478, 513 (1978).</p><p>After a hearing ends, the ALJ issues an \xe2\x80\x9cinitial decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201.360(a)(1).  That decision must set out \xe2\x80\x9cfindings and conclusions\xe2\x80\x9d about all \xe2\x80\x9cmaterial issues of fact [and] law\xe2\x80\x9d; it also must include the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate order, sanction, relief, or denial thereof.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201.360(b).  The Commission can then review the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision, either upon request or <i>sua\xc2\xa0sponte</i>.  See \xc2\xa7201.360(d)(1).  But if it opts against review, the Commission \xe2\x80\x9cissue[s] an order that the [ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s] decision has become final.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201.360(d)(2).  At that point, the initial decision is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed the action of the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(c).</p><p>This case began when the SEC instituted an administrative proceeding against petitioner Raymond Lucia and his investment company.  Lucia marketed a retirement savings strategy called \xe2\x80\x9cBuckets of Money.\xe2\x80\x9d  In the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s view, Lucia used misleading slideshow presentations to deceive prospective clients.  The SEC charged Lucia under the Investment Advisers Act, \xc2\xa780b\xe2\x80\x931 <i>et seq.</i>, and assigned ALJ Cameron Elliot to adjudicate the case.  After nine days of testimony and argument, Judge Elliot issued an initial decision concluding that Lucia had violated the Act and imposing sanctions, including civil penalties of $300,000 and a lifetime bar from the investment industry.  In his decision, Judge Elliot made factual findings about only one of the four ways the SEC thought Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s slideshow misled investors.  The Commission thus remanded for factfinding on the other three claims, explaining that an ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal experience with the witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d places him \xe2\x80\x9cin the best position to make findings of fact\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cresolve any conflicts in the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a.  Judge Elliot then made additional findings of deception and issued a revised initial decision, with the same sanctions.  See <i>id.,</i> at 118a.</p><p>On appeal to the SEC, Lucia argued that the administrative proceeding was invalid because Judge Elliot had not been constitutionally appointed.  According to Lucia, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d and thus subject to the Appointments Clause.  Under that Clause, Lucia noted, only the President, \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Law,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cHeads of Departments\xe2\x80\x9d can appoint \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Art. II, \xc2\xa72, cl. 2.  And none of those actors had made Judge Elliot an ALJ.  To be sure, the Commission itself counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cHead[\xc2\xa0] of Department[\xc2\xa0].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.; see <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> v. <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</i>,561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, 511\xe2\x80\x93513 (2010).  But the Commission had left the task of appointing ALJs, including Judge Elliot, to SEC staff members.  See <i>supra,</i> at 1.  As a result, Lucia contended, Judge Elliot lacked constitutional authority to do his job.</p><p>The Commission rejected Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  It held that the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are not \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, they are \xe2\x80\x9cmere employees\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94officials with lesser responsibilities who fall outside the Appointments Clause\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 87a.  The Commission reasoned that its ALJs do not \xe2\x80\x9cexercise significant authority independent of [its own] supervision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 88a.  Because that is so (said the SEC), they need no special, high-level appointment.  See <i>id.,</i> at 86a.</p><p>Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s claim fared no better in the Court of Appeals for the D.\xc2\xa0C. Circuit.  A panel of that court seconded the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s view that SEC ALJs are employees rather than officers, and so are not subject to the Appointments Clause.  See 832 F. 3d 277, 283\xe2\x80\x93289 (2016).  Lucia then petitioned for rehearing en banc.  The Court of Appeals granted that request and heard argument in the case.  But the ten members of the en banc court divided evenly, resulting in a <i>per curiam</i> order denying Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  See 868 F. 3d 1021 (2017).  That decision conflicted with one from the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  See <i>Bandimere</i> v. <i>SEC</i>, 844 F. 3d 1168, 1179 (2016).</p><p>Lucia asked us to resolve the split by deciding whether the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States within the meaning of the Appointments Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.  Up to that point, the Federal Government (as represented by the Department of Justice) had defended the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s position that SEC ALJs are employees, not officers.  But in responding to Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the Government switched sides.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]  So when we granted the petition, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2018), we also appointed an <i>amicus curiae</i> to defend the judgment below.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  We now reverse.</p><p>II</p><p>The sole question here is whether the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d or simply employees of the Federal Government.  The Appointments Clause prescribes the exclusive means of appointing \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers.\xe2\x80\x9d  Only the President, a court of law, or a head of department can do so.  See Art. II, \xc2\xa72, cl. 2.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]  And as all parties agree, none of those actors appointed Judge Elliot before he heard Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s case; instead, SEC staff members gave him an ALJ slot.  See Brief for Petitioners 15; Brief for United States 38; Brief for Court-Appointed <i>Amicus Cu- riae</i> 21.  So if the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are constitutional officers, Lucia raises a valid Appointments Clause claim.  The only way to defeat his position is to show that those ALJs are not officers at all, but instead non-officer employees\xe2\x80\x94part of the broad swath of \xe2\x80\x9clesser functionaries\xe2\x80\x9d in the Government\xe2\x80\x99s workforce.  <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo</i>,424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 126, n. 162 (1976) (<i>per curiam</i>).  For if that is true, the Appointments Clause cares not a whit about who named them.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine</i>,99 U.\xc2\xa0S. 508, 510 (1879).</p><p>Two decisions set out this Court\xe2\x80\x99s basic framework for distinguishing between officers and employees.  <i>Germaine </i>held that \xe2\x80\x9ccivil surgeons\xe2\x80\x9d (doctors hired to perform various physical exams) were mere employees because their duties were \xe2\x80\x9coccasional or temporary\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing and permanent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 511\xe2\x80\x93512.  Stressing \xe2\x80\x9cideas of tenure [and] duration,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court there made clear that an individual must occupy a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing\xe2\x80\x9d position established by law to qualify as an officer.  <i>Id.,</i> at 511.  <i>Buckley </i>then set out another requirement, central to this case.  It determined that members of a federal commission were officers only after finding that they \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[ed] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 126.  The inquiry thus focused on the extent of power an individual wields in carrying out his assigned functions.</p><p>Both the <i>amicus</i> and the Government urge us to elaborate on <i>Buckley</i>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority\xe2\x80\x9d test, but another of our precedents makes that project unnecessary.  The standard is no doubt framed in general terms, tempting advocates to add whatever glosses best suit their arguments.  See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 14 (contending that an individual wields \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority\xe2\x80\x9d when he has \xe2\x80\x9c(i) the power to bind the government or private parties (ii) in her own name rather than in the name of a superior officer\xe2\x80\x9d); Reply Brief for United States 2 (countering that an individual wields that authority when he has \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to bind the government or third parties on significant matters\xe2\x80\x9d or to undertake other \xe2\x80\x9cimportant and distinctively sovereign functions\xe2\x80\x9d).  And maybe one day we will see a need to refine or enhance the test <i>Buckley </i>set out so concisely.  But that day is not this one, because in <i>Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868 (1991), we applied the unadorned \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority\xe2\x80\x9d test to adjudicative officials who are near-carbon copies of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs.  As we now explain, our analysis there (sans any more detailed legal criteria) necessarily decides this case.</p><p>The officials at issue in <i>Freytag</i> were the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial trial judges\xe2\x80\x9d (STJs) of the United States Tax Court.  The authority of those judges depended on the significance of the tax dispute before them.  In \xe2\x80\x9ccomparatively narrow and minor matters,\xe2\x80\x9d they could both hear and definitively resolve a case for the Tax Court.  <i>Id</i>., at 873.  In more major matters, they could preside over the hearing, but could not issue the final decision; instead, they were to \xe2\x80\x9cprepare proposed findings and an opinion\xe2\x80\x9d for a regular Tax Court judge to consider.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The proceeding challenged in <i>Freytag</i> was a major one, involving $1.5 billion in alleged tax deficiencies.  See <i>id.,</i> at 871, n.\xc2\xa01.  After conducting a 14-week trial, the STJ drafted a proposed decision in favor of the Government.  A regular judge then adopted the STJ\xe2\x80\x99s work as the opinion of the Tax Court.  See <i>id.,</i> at 872.  The losing parties argued on appeal that the STJ was not constitutionally appointed.</p><p>This Court held that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs are officers, not mere employees.  Citing <i>Germaine</i>, the Court first found that STJs hold a continuing office established by law.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881.  They serve on an ongoing, rather than a \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary [or] episodic[,] basis\xe2\x80\x9d; and their \xe2\x80\x9cduties, salary, and means of appointment\xe2\x80\x9d are all specified in the Tax Code.  <i>Ibid.  </i>The Court then considered, as <i>Buckley </i>demands, the \xe2\x80\x9csignificance\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d STJs wield.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881.  In addressing that issue, the Government had argued that STJs are employees, rather than officers, in all cases (like the one at issue) in which they could not \xe2\x80\x9center a final decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>But the Court thought the Government\xe2\x80\x99s focus on finality \xe2\x80\x9cignore[d] the significance of the duties and discretion that [STJs] possess.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Describing the responsibilities involved in presiding over adversarial hearings, the Court said: STJs \xe2\x80\x9ctake testimony, conduct trials, rule on the admissibility of evidence, and have the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 881\xe2\x80\x93882. <i> </i>And the Court observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n the course of carrying out these important functions, the [STJs] exercise significant discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 882.  That fact meant they were offi- cers, even when their decisions were not final.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]</p><p><i>Freytag </i>says everything necessary to decide this case.  To begin, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs, like the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs, hold a continuing office established by law.  See <i>id</i>., at 881.  Indeed, everyone here\xe2\x80\x94Lucia, the Government, and the <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x94agrees on that point.  See Brief for Petitioners 21; Brief for United States 17\xe2\x80\x9318, n. 3; Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 22, n. 7.  Far from serving temporarily or episodically, SEC ALJs \xe2\x80\x9creceive[\xc2\xa0] a career appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 CFR \xc2\xa7930.204(a) (2018).  And that appointment is to a position created by statute, down to its \xe2\x80\x9cduties, salary, and means of appointment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freytag</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881; see 5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7556\xe2\x80\x93557, 5372, 3105.</p><p>Still more, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs exercise the same \xe2\x80\x9csignificant discretion\xe2\x80\x9d when carrying out the same \xe2\x80\x9cimportant functions\xe2\x80\x9d as STJs do.  <i>Freytag</i>,<i> </i>501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  Both sets of officials have all the authority needed to ensure fair and orderly adversarial hearings\xe2\x80\x94indeed, nearly all the tools of federal trial judges.  See <i>Butz</i>, 438 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 513; <i>supra,</i> at 2.  Consider in order the four specific (if overlapping) powers <i>Freytag </i>mentioned.  First, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs (like the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs) \xe2\x80\x9ctake testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881.  More precisely, they \xe2\x80\x9c[r]eceiv[e] evidence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xamine witnesses\xe2\x80\x9d at hearings, and may also take pre-hearing depositions.  17 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201.111(c), 200.14(a)(4); see5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7556(c)(4).  Second, the ALJs (like STJs) \xe2\x80\x9cconduct trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  As detailed earlier, they administer oaths, rule on motions, and generally \xe2\x80\x9cregulat[e] the course of\xe2\x80\x9d a hearing, as well as the conduct of parties and counsel.  \xc2\xa7201.111; see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7200.14(a)(1), (a)(7); <i>supra,</i> at 2.  Third, the ALJs (like STJs) \xe2\x80\x9crule on the admissibility of evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882; see \xc2\xa7201.111(c).  They thus critically shape the administrative record (as they also do when issuing document subpoenas).  See \xc2\xa7201.111(b).  And fourth, the ALJs (like STJs) \xe2\x80\x9chave the power to enforce compliance with discovery orders.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  In particular, they may punish all \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ontemptuous conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d including violations of those orders, by means as severe  as excluding the offender from the hearing.  See \xc2\xa7201.180(a)(1).  So point for point\xe2\x80\x94straight from <i>Freytag</i>\xe2\x80\x99s list\xe2\x80\x94the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs have equivalent duties and powers as STJs in conducting adversarial inquiries.</p><p>And at the close of those proceedings, ALJs issue decisions much like that in <i>Freytag\xe2\x80\x94</i>except with potentially more independent effect.  As the <i>Freytag </i>Court recounted, STJs \xe2\x80\x9cprepare proposed findings and an opinion\xe2\x80\x9d adjudicating charges and assessing tax liabilities.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 873; see <i>supra,</i> at 7.  Similarly, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs issue decisions containing factual findings, legal conclusions, and appropriate remedies.  See \xc2\xa7201.360(b); <i>supra,</i> at 2.  And what happens next reveals that the ALJ can play the more autonomous role.  In a major case like <i>Freytag</i>,<i> </i>a regular Tax Court judge must always review an STJ\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  And that opinion counts for nothing unless the regular judge adopts it as his own.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 873.  By contrast, the SEC can decide against reviewing an ALJ decision at all.  And when the SEC declines review (and issues an order saying so), the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s decision itself \xe2\x80\x9cbecomes final\xe2\x80\x9d and is \xe2\x80\x9cdeemed the action of the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7201.360(d)(2);15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(c); see <i>supra,</i> at 2.  That last-word capacity makes this an <i>a\xc2\xa0fortiori</i> case: If the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs are officers, as <i>Freytag</i> held, then the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs must be too.</p><p>The <i>amicus</i> offers up two distinctions to support the opposite conclusion.  His main argument relates to \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to enforce compliance with discovery orders\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the fourth of <i>Freytag</i>\xe2\x80\x99s listed functions.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s STJs, he states, had that power \xe2\x80\x9cbecause they had authority to punish contempt\xe2\x80\x9d (including discovery violations) through fines or imprisonment.  Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 37; see <i>id.,</i> at 37, n.\xc2\xa010 (citing26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77456(c)).  By contrast, he observes, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs have less capacious power to sanction misconduct.  The <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s secondary distinction involves how the Tax Court and Commission, respectively, review the factfinding of STJs and ALJs.  The Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s rules state that an STJ\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact \xe2\x80\x9cshall be presumed\xe2\x80\x9d correct.  Tax Court Rule 183(d).  In comparison, the <i>amicus </i>notes, the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s regulations include no such deferential standard.  See Brief for <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10, 38, n.\xc2\xa011.</p><p>But those distinctions make no difference for officer status.  To start with the <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s primary point, <i>Freytag </i>referenced only the general \xe2\x80\x9cpower to enforce compliance with discovery orders,\xe2\x80\x9d not any particular method of doing so.  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.  True enough, the power to toss malefactors in jail is an especially muscular means of enforcement\xe2\x80\x94the nuclear option of compliance tools.  But just as armies can often enforce their will through conventional weapons, so too can administrative judges.  As noted earlier, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs can respond to discovery violations and other contemptuous conduct by excluding the wrongdoer (whether party or lawyer) from the proceedings\xe2\x80\x94a powerful disincentive to resist a court order.  See \xc2\xa7201.180(a)(1)(i); <i>supra,</i> at 9.  Similarly, if the offender is an attorney, the ALJ can \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ummarily suspend\xe2\x80\x9d him from representing his client\xe2\x80\x94not something the typical lawyer wants to invite.  \xc2\xa7201.180(a)(1)(ii).  And finally, a judge who will, in the end, issue an opinion complete with factual findings, legal conclusions, and sanctions has substantial informal power to ensure the parties stay in line.  Contrary to the <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s view, all that is enough to satisfy <i>Freytag</i>\xe2\x80\x99s fourth item (even supposing, which we do not decide, that each of those items is necessary for someone conducting adversarial hearings to count as an officer).</p><p>And the <i>amicus</i>\xe2\x80\x99s standard-of-review distinction fares just as badly.  The <i>Freytag </i>Court<i> </i>never suggested that the deference given to STJs\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings mattered to its Appointments Clause analysis.  Indeed, the relevant part of <i>Freytag </i>did not so much as mention the subject (even though it came up at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 33\xe2\x80\x9341).  And anyway, the Commission often accords a similar deference to its ALJs, even if not by regulation.  The Commission has repeatedly stated, as it did below, that its ALJs are in the \xe2\x80\x9cbest position to make findings of fact\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cresolve any conflicts in the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a (quoting <i>In\xc2\xa0re Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC</i>, SEC Release No. 57741 (Apr. 30, 2008)).  (That was why the SEC insisted that Judge Elliot make factual findings on all four allegations of Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s deception.  See <i>supra,</i> at 3.)  And when factfinding derives from credibility judgments, as it frequently does, acceptance is near-automatic.  Recognizing ALJs\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal experience with the witnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d the Commission adopts their \xe2\x80\x9ccredibility finding[s] absent overwhelming evidence to the contrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 241a; <i>In\xc2\xa0re Clawson</i>, SEC Release No. 48143 (July 9, 2003).  That practice erases the constitutional line the <i>amicus </i>proposes to draw.</p><p>The only issue left is remedial.  For all the reasons we have given, and all those <i>Freytag </i>gave before, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the Appointments Clause.  And as noted earlier, Judge Elliot heard and decided Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s case without the kind of appointment the Clause requires.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5.  This Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9cone who makes a timely challenge to the constitutional validity of the appointment of an officer who adjudicates his case\xe2\x80\x9d is entitled to relief.  <i>Ryder</i> v. <i>United States</i>,515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177, 182\xe2\x80\x93183 (1995).  Lucia made just such a timely challenge: He contested the validity of Judge Elliot\xe2\x80\x99s appointment before the Commission, and continued pressing that claim in the Court of Appeals and this Court.  So what relief follows?  This Court has also held that the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d remedy for an adjudication tainted with an appointments violation is a new \xe2\x80\x9chearing before a properly appointed\xe2\x80\x9d official.  <i>Id.</i>, at 183, 188.  And we add today one thing more.  That official cannot be Judge Elliot, even if he has by now received (or receives sometime in the future) a constitutional appointment.  Judge Elliot has already both heard Lucia\xe2\x80\x99s case and issued an initial decision on the merits.  He cannot be expected to consider the matter as though he had not adjudicated it before.[<a href="#F5">5</a>]  To cure the constitutional error, another ALJ (or the Commission itself) must hold the new hearing to which Lucia is entitled.[<a href="#F6">6</a>]</p><p>We accordingly reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0In the same certiorari-stage brief, the Government asked us to add a second question presented: whether the statutory restrictions on removing the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs are constitutional.

See <i>Edmond</i> v. <i>United States</i>,520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651, 659\xe2\x80\x93660 (1997).  Only the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, can appoint a principal officer; but Congress (instead of relying on that method) may authorize the President alone, a court, or a department head to appoint an inferior officer.  See <i>ibid</i>.  Both the Government and Lucia view the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s ALJs as inferior officers and acknowledge that the Commission, as a head of department, can constitutionally appoint them.  See Brief for United States 38; Brief for Petitioners 50\xe2\x80\x9351. </span></div><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T4">4</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0The Court also provided an alternative basis for viewing the STJs as officers.  \xe2\x80\x9cEven if the duties of [STJs in major cases] were not as significant as we .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. have found them,\xe2\x80\x9d we stated, \xe2\x80\x9cour conclusion would be unchanged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freytag</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 882.

See <i>ibid.  </i>Justice Sotomayor relies on that back-up rationale in trying to reconcile <i>Freytag </i>with her view that \xe2\x80\x9ca prerequisite to officer status is the authority\xe2\x80\x9d to issue at least some \xe2\x80\x9cfinal decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>,<i> </i>at 5 (dissenting opinion).  But <i>Freytag</i> has two parts, and its primary analysis explicitly rejects Justice Sotomayor\xe2\x80\x99s theory that final decisionmaking authority is a <i>sine qua non</i> of officer status.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 881\xe2\x80\x93882.  As she acknowledges, she must expunge that reasoning to make her reading work.

We best accomplish that goal by providing a successful litigant with a hearing before a new judge.  That is especially so because (as Justice Breyer points out) the old judge would have no reason to think he did anything wrong on the merits, see <i>post</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x94and so could be expected to reach all the same judgments.  But we do not hold that a new officer is required for every Appointments Clause violation.  As Justice Breyer suggests, we can give that remedy here because other ALJs (and the Commission) are available to hear this case on remand.  See <i>ibid.</i>  If instead the Appointments Clause problem is with the Commission itself, so that there is no substitute decisionmaker, the rule of necessity would presumably kick in and allow the Commission to do the rehearing.

See <i>ante, </i>at 1; App. to Pet. for Cert. 298a\xe2\x80\x93299a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I do not believe that the Administrative Procedure Act permits the Commission to delegate its power to appoint its administrative law judges to its staff.  We have held that, for purposes of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s Appointments Clause, the Commission itself is a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Hea[d]\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Departmen[t].\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 512\xe2\x80\x93513.  Thus, reading the statute as referring to the Commission itself, and not to its staff, avoids a difficult constitutional question, namely, the very question that the Court answers today: whether the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s administrative law judges are constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d whose appointment Congress may vest only in the President, the \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Law,\xe2\x80\x9d or the \xe2\x80\x9cHeads of Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02; see <i>United States</i> v. <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i>,\n\n241 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394, 401 (1916) (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute must be construed, if fairly possible, so as to avoid not only the conclusion that it is unconstitutional but also grave doubts upon that score\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I have found no other statutory provision that would permit the Commission to delegate the power to appoint its administrative law judges to its staff.  The statute establishing and governing the Commission does allow the Commission to \xe2\x80\x9cdelegate, by published order or rule, any of its functions to a division of the Commission, an individual Commissioner, an administrative law judge, or an employee or employee board.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(a).  But this provision requires a \xe2\x80\x9cpublished order or rule,\xe2\x80\x9d and the Commission here published no relevant delegating order or rule.  Rather, Lucia discovered the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s appointment system for administrative law judges only when the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement division staff filed an affidavit in this case describing that staff-based system.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 295a\xe2\x80\x93299a.  Regardless, the same constitutional-avoidance reasons that should inform our construction of the Administrative Procedure Act should also lead us to interpret the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s general delegation authority as excluding the power to delegate to staff the authority to appoint its administrative law judges, so as to avoid the constitutional question the Court reaches in this case.  See <i>Jin Fuey Moy</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 401.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The analysis may differ for other agencies that employ administrative law judges.  Each agency\xe2\x80\x99s governing statute is different, and some, unlike the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s, may allow the delegation of duties without a published order or rule.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(a)(7) (applicable to the Social Security Administration).  Similarly, other agencies\xe2\x80\x99 administrative law judges perform distinct functions, and their means of appointment may therefore not raise the constitutional questions that inform my reading of the relevant statutes here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot, in my view, is that for statutory, not constitutional, reasons, the Commission did not lawfully appoint the Administrative Law Judge here at issue.  And this Court should decide no more than that.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The reason why it is important to go no further arises from the holding in a case this Court decided eight years ago, <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The case concerned statutory provisions protecting members of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board from removal without cause.  The Court held in that case that the Executive Vesting Clause of the Constitution, Art. II, \xc2\xa71 (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America\xe2\x80\x9d), forbade Congress from providing members of the Board with \xe2\x80\x9cmultilevel protection from removal\xe2\x80\x9d by the President.  <i>Free Enterprise Fund,</i> 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 484; see <i>id.,</i> at 514 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress cannot limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority\xe2\x80\x9d by providing \xe2\x80\x9ctwo levels of protection from removal for those who .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. exercise significant executive power\xe2\x80\x9d).  But see <i>id.,</i> at 514\xe2\x80\x93549 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  Because, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the relevant statutes (1) granted the Securities and Exchange Commissioners protection from removal without cause, (2) gave the Commissioners sole authority to remove Board members, and (3) protected Board members from removal without cause, the statutes provided Board members with two levels of protection from removal and consequently violated the Constitution.  <i>Id.,</i> at 495\xe2\x80\x93498.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addressing the constitutionality of the Board members\xe2\x80\x99 removal protections, the Court emphasized that the Board members were \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive officers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94more specifically, \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officers\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Appointments Clause.  <i>E.g., id.,</i> at 492\xe2\x80\x93495, 504\xe2\x80\x93505.  The significance of that fact to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis is not entirely clear.  The Court said:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cThe parties here concede that Board members are executive \xe2\x80\x98Officers\xe2\x80\x99, as that term is used in the Constitution.  We do not decide the status of other Government employees, nor do we decide whether \xe2\x80\x98lesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 must be subject to the same sort of control as those who exercise \xe2\x80\x98significant authority pursuant to the laws.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 506 (quoting <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 126, and n.\xc2\xa0162 (1976) (<i>per curiam</i>); citations omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the Court seemed not only to limit its holding to the Board members themselves, but also to suggest that Government employees who were not officers would be distinguishable from the Board members on that ground alone.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For present purposes, however, the implications of <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>\xe2\x80\x99s technical-sounding holding about \xe2\x80\x9cmultilevel protection from removal\xe2\x80\x9d remain potentially dramatic.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 484.  The same statute, the Administrative Procedure Act, that provides that the \xe2\x80\x9cagency\xe2\x80\x9d will appoint its administrative law judges also protects the administrative law judges from removal without cause.  In particular, the statute says that an</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9caction may be taken against an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of this title by the agency in which the administrative law judge is employed only for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board on the record after opportunity for hearing before the Board.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As with appointments, this provision constituted an important part of the Administrative Procedure Act when it was originally enacted in 1946.  See \xc2\xa711,\n\n60Stat.\n244.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Administrative Procedure Act thus allows administrative law judges to be removed only \xe2\x80\x9cfor good cause\xe2\x80\x9d found by the Merit Systems Protection Board.  \xc2\xa77521(a).  And the President may, in turn, remove members of the Merit Systems Protection Board only for \xe2\x80\x9cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71202(d).  Thus, Congress seems to have provided administrative law judges with two levels of protection from removal without cause\xe2\x80\x94just what <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> interpreted the Constitution to forbid in the case of the Board members.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The substantial independence that the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s removal protections provide to administrative law judges is a central part of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s overall scheme.  See <i>Ramspeck</i> v. <i>Federal Trial Examiners Conference</i>,\n\n345 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 130 (1953); <i>Wong Yang Sung</i> v. <i>McGrath</i>,\n\n339 U.\xc2\xa0S. 33, 46 (1950).  Before the Administrative Procedure Act, hearing examiners \xe2\x80\x9cwere in a dependent status\xe2\x80\x9d to their employing agency, with their classification, compensation, and promotion all dependent on how the agency they worked for rated them.  <i>Ramspeck</i>, 345 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 130.  As a result of that dependence, \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any complaints were voiced against the actions of the hearing examiners, it being charged that they were mere tools of the agency concerned and subservient to the agency heads in making their proposed findings of fact and recommendations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 131.  The Administrative Procedure Act responded to those complaints by giving administrative law judges \xe2\x80\x9cindependence and tenure within the existing Civil Service system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 132; cf. <i>Wong Yang Sung</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 41\xe2\x80\x9346 (referring to removal protections as among the Administrative Procedure Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csafeguards .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. intended to ameliorate\xe2\x80\x9d the  perceived \xe2\x80\x9cevils\xe2\x80\x9d of commingling of adjudicative and prosecutorial functions in agencies).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>If</i> the <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding applies equally to the administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x94and I stress the \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94then to hold that the administrative law judges are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d is, <i>perhaps</i>, to hold that their removal protections are unconstitutional.  This would risk transforming administrative law judges from independent adjudicators into <i>dependent</i> decisionmakers, serving at the pleasure of the Commission.  Similarly, to apply <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>\xe2\x80\x99s holding to high-level civil servants threatens to change the nature of our merit-based civil service as it has existed from the time of President Chester Alan Arthur.  See <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 540\xe2\x80\x93542 (Breyer, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I have stressed the words \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps\xe2\x80\x9d in the previous paragraph because <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>\xe2\x80\x99s hold- ing may not invalidate the removal protections applicable to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s administrative law judges even if the judges are inferior \xe2\x80\x9cofficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Appointments Clause.  In my dissent in <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>, I pointed out that under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, the removal protections applicable to administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x94including specifically the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x94would seem to be unconstitutional.  <i>Id.</i>, at 542, 587.  But the Court disagreed, saying that \xe2\x80\x9cnone of the positions [my dissent] identifie[d] are similarly situated to the Board.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 506.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The <i>Free Enterprise Fund </i>Court gave three reasons why administrative law judges were distinguishable from the Board members at issue in that case.  First, the Court said that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether administrative law judges are necessarily \xe2\x80\x98Officers of the United States\xe2\x80\x99 is disputed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 507, n.\xc2\xa010.  Second, the Court said that \xe2\x80\x9cunlike members of the Board, many administrative law judges of course perform adjudicative rather than enforcement or policymaking functions, see [5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C.] \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7554(d), 3105, or possess purely recommendatory powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And, third, the Court pointed out that the civil service \xe2\x80\x9cemployees\xe2\x80\x9d and administrative law judges to whom I referred in my dissent do not \xe2\x80\x9cenjoy the same significant and unusual protections from Presidential oversight as members of the Board.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 506.  The Court added that the kind of \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protection the statutes provided for Board members was \xe2\x80\x9cun- usually high.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 503.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority here removes the first distinction, for it holds that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s administrative law judges are inferior \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 1.  The other two distinctions remain.  See, <i>e.g., Wiener</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n357 U.\xc2\xa0S. 349, 355\xe2\x80\x93356 (1958) (holding that Congress is free to protect bodies tasked with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adjudicat[ing] according to law\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98from the control or coercive influence, direct or indirect,\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of either the Executive or Congress\xe2\x80\x9d) (quoting <i>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</i> v. <i>United States</i>, \n\n295 U.\xc2\xa0S. 602, 629 (1935)).<i> </i>But the Solicitor General has nevertheless argued strongly that we should now decide the constitutionality of the administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x99 removal protections as well as their means of appointment.  And in his view, the administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x99 statutory removal protections violate the Constitution (as interpreted in <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>), unless we construe those protections as giving the Commission substantially greater power to remove administrative law judges than it presently has.  See Merits Brief for Respondent 45\xe2\x80\x9355.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s account, for the administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x99 removal protections to be constitutional, the Commission itself must have the power to remove administrative law judges \xe2\x80\x9cfor failure to follow lawful instructions or perform adequately.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 48.  The Merit Systems Protection Board would then review only the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding, and not whether the facts (as found) count as \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause\xe2\x80\x9d for removal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  This technical-sounding standard would seem to weaken the administrative law judges\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d removal protections considerably, by permitting the Commission to remove an administrative law judge with whose judgments it disagrees\xe2\x80\x94say, because the judge did not find a securities-law violation where the Commission thought there  was one, or vice versa.  In such cases, the law allows the Commission to overrule an administrative law judge\xe2\x80\x99s findings, for the decision is ultimately the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s.  See\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(b).  But it does not allow the Commission to fire the administrative law judge.  See\n\n5 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77521.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And now it should be clear why the application of <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> to administrative law judges is important.  If that decision does not limit or forbid Congress\xe2\x80\x99 statutory \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protections, then a holding that the administrative law judges are \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d does not conflict with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent as revealed in the statute.  But, if the holding is to the contrary, and more particularly if a holding that administrative law judges are \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d brings with it application of <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>\xe2\x80\x99s limitation on \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protections from removal, then a determination that administrative law judges are, constitutionally speaking, \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d would directly conflict with Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent, as revealed in the statute.  In that case, it would be clear to me that Congress did not intend that consequence, and that it therefore did not intend to make administrative law judges \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Offi- cers\xe2\x80\x9d at all.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent on the question matters, in my view, because the Appointments Clause is properly understood to grant Congress a degree of leeway as to whether particular Government workers are officers or instead mere employees not subject to the Appointments Clause.  The words \xe2\x80\x9cby Law\xe2\x80\x9d appear twice in the Clause.  It says that the President (\xe2\x80\x9cwith the Advice and Consent of the Senate\xe2\x80\x9d) shall appoint \xe2\x80\x9cAmbassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. which shall be <i>established by Law</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02 (emphasis added).  It then adds that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress may <i>by Law</i> vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The use of the words \xe2\x80\x9cby Law\xe2\x80\x9d to describe the establishment and means of appointment of \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d together with the fact that Article I of the Constitution vests the legislative power in Congress, suggests that (other than the officers the Constitution specifically lists) Congress, not the Judicial Branch alone, must play a major role in determining who is an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent in this specific respect is often highly relevant.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 leeway is not, of course, absolute\xe2\x80\x94it may not, for example, say that positions the Constitution itself describes as \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers\xe2\x80\x9d are not \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers.\xe2\x80\x9d  But given the constitutional language, the Court, when deciding whether other positions are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d under the Appointments Clause, should give substantial weight to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">How is the Court to decide whether Congress intended that the holder of a particular Government position count as an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d?  Congress might, of course, write explicitly into the statute that the employee \xe2\x80\x9cis an officer of the United States under the Appointments Clause,\xe2\x80\x9d but an explicit phrase of this kind is unlikely to appear.  If it does not, then I would approach the question like any other difficult question of statutory interpretation.  Several considerations, among others, are likely to be relevant.  First, as the Court said in <i>Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868, 881 (1991), and repeats today, <i>ante, </i>at 6, where Congress grants an appointee \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98significant authority pursuant to the laws to the United States,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that supports the view that (but should not determinatively decide that) Congress made that appointee an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Freytag</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 881 (quoting <i>Buckley</i>, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 126); see also <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine</i>,\n\n99 U.\xc2\xa0S. 508, 511 (1879) (holding that the term \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cembraces the ideas of tenure, duration, emolument, and duties\xe2\x80\x9d).  The means of appointment that Congress chooses is also instructive.  Where Congress provides a method  of appointment that mimics a method the Appointments Clause allows for \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers,\xe2\x80\x9d that fact too supports the view that (but does not determinatively decide that) Congress viewed the position as one to be held by an \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer,\xe2\x80\x9d and vice versa.  See <i>id.</i>, at 509\xe2\x80\x93511.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> suggests a third indica- tion of \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d status\xe2\x80\x94did Congress provide the position with removal protections that would be unconstitutional if provided for an \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d?  See 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 514.  That fact would support (but again not be determinative of) the opposite view\xe2\x80\x94that Congress did not intend to confer \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officer\xe2\x80\x9d status on the position.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As I said, these statutory features, while highly relevant, need not always prove determinative.  The vast number of different civil service positions, with different tasks, different needs, and different requirements for independence, mean that this is not the place to lay down bright-line rules.  Rather, as this Court has said, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he versatility of circumstances often mocks a natural desire for definitiveness\xe2\x80\x9d in this area.  <i>Wiener</i>, 357 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">No case from this Court holds that Congress lacks this sort of constitutional leeway in determining whether a particular Government position will be filled by an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  To the contrary, while we have repeatedly addressed whether particular officials are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers,\xe2\x80\x9d in all cases but one, we have upheld the appointment procedures Congress enacted as consistent with the Appointments Clause.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Edmond</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 651, 666 (1997) (holding that Congress\xe2\x80\x99 appointment procedure for military court judges \xe2\x80\x9cis in conformity with the Appointments Clause of the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Freytag</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 888\xe2\x80\x93891 (same as to special trial judges of the Tax Court);<i> Rice</i> v. <i>Ames</i>,\n\n180 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371, 378 (1901) (same as to district court \xe2\x80\x9ccommissioners\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Ex parte Siebold</i>,\n\n100 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371, 397\xe2\x80\x93398 (1880) (same as  to \xe2\x80\x9csupervisors of election\xe2\x80\x9d).  But see <i>Buckley</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 124\xe2\x80\x93137.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The one exception was <i>Buckley</i>, 424 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 124\xe2\x80\x93137, in which the Court set aside Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prescribed appointment method for some members of the Federal Election Commission\xe2\x80\x94appointment by Congress itself\xe2\x80\x94as inconsistent with the Appointments Clause.  But <i>Buckley</i> involved Federal Election Commission members with enormous powers.  They had \xe2\x80\x9cprimary and substantial responsibility for administering and enforcing the\xe2\x80\x9d Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, <i>id.</i>, at 109, an \xe2\x80\x9cintricate statutory scheme .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to regulate federal election campaigns,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 12.

Federal Election Commissioners thus had powers akin to the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal Officer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of an Executive Department, whom the Constitution expressly refers to as \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers,\xe2\x80\x9d see Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01.  It is not surprising that Congress exceeded any leeway the Appointments Clause granted when it deviated from the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s appointments\xe2\x80\x99 methods in respect to an office with powers very similar to those of the Officers listed in the Constitution itself.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, neither <i>Buckley</i> nor any other case forecloses an interpretation of the Appointments Clause that focuses principally on whether the relevant statutes show that Congress intended that a particular Government position be held by an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Adopting such an approach, I would not answer the question whether the Securities and Exchange Commission\xe2\x80\x99s administrative law judges are constitutional \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers\xe2\x80\x9d without first deciding the pre-existing <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> question\xe2\x80\x94namely, what effect that holding would have on the statutory \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d removal protections that Congress provided for administrative law judges.  If, for example, <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> means that saying administrative law judges are \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d will cause them to lose their \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d removal protections, then I would likely hold that the administrative law judges are not \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers,\xe2\x80\x9d for to say otherwise would be to contradict Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of those protections in the Administrative Procedure Act.  In contrast, if <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> does not mean that an administrative law judge (if an \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r] of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d) would lose \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protections, then it is more likely that interpreting the Administrative Procedure Act as conferring such status would not run contrary to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.  In such a case, I would more likely hold that, given the other features of the Administrative Procedure Act, Congress did intend to make administrative law judges inferior \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Separately, I also disagree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the proper remedy in this case requires a hearing before a <i>different </i>administrative law judge.  <i>Ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has now itself appointed the Administrative Law Judge in question, and I see no reason why he could not rehear the case.  After all, when a judge is reversed on appeal and a new trial ordered, typically the judge who rehears the case is the same judge who heard it the first time.  The reversal here is based on a technical constitutional question, and the reversal implies no criticism at all of the original judge or his ability to conduct the new proceedings.  For him to preside once again would not violate the structural purposes that we have said the Appointments Clause serves, see <i>Freytag</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 878, nor would it, in any obvious way, violate the Due Process Clause.  </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Regardless, this matter was not addressed below and has not been fully argued here.  I would, at a minimum, ask the Court of Appeals to examine it on remand rather than decide it here now.  That is especially so because the majority seems to state a general rule that a different \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d must <i>always</i> preside after an Appointments Clause violation.  In a case like this one, that is a relatively minor imposition, because the Commission has other administrative law judges.  But in other cases\xe2\x80\x94say, a case adjudicated by an improperly appointed (but since reap- pointed) Commission itself\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d in question may be the <i>only</i> such \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer,\xe2\x80\x9d so that no substitute will be available.  The majority suggests that in such cases, the \xe2\x80\x9crule of necessity\xe2\x80\x9d may excuse compliance with its newfound different-\xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  <i>Ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, n.\xc2\xa05.  But that still does not explain why the Constitution would require a hearing before a different \xe2\x80\x9cOfficer\xe2\x80\x9d at all.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to address the Appointments Clause question separately from the constitutional removal question is problematic.  By considering each question in isolation, the Court risks (should the Court later extend <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i>) unraveling, step-by-step, the foundations of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s administrative adjudication system as it has existed for decades, and perhaps of the merit-based civil-service system in general.  And the Court risks doing so without considering that potential consequence.  For these reasons, I concur in the judgment in part and, with respect, I dissent in part.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3918477">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 17\xe2\x80\x93130</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">RAYMOND J.

Given the sheer number of inferior officers, it would be too burdensome to require each of them to run the gauntlet of Senate confirmation.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine</i>,\n\n99 U.\xc2\xa0S. 508, 509\xe2\x80\x93510 (1879); 2 Records of the Federal Convention of 1787, pp. 627\xe2\x80\x93628 (M.\xc2\xa0Farrand ed. 1911).  But, by specifying only a limited number of actors who can appoint inferior officers without Senate confirmation, the Appointments Clause maintains clear lines of accountability\xe2\x80\x94encouraging good appointments and giving the public someone to blame for bad ones.  See The Federalist No. 76, p.\xc2\xa0455 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (A.\xc2\xa0Hamilton); Wilson, Lectures on Law: Government, in 1 The Works of James Wilson 343, 359\xe2\x80\x93361 (J. Andrews ed., 1896).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Founders likely understood the term \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass all federal civil officials who perform an ongoing, statutory duty\xe2\x80\x94no matter how important or significant the duty.  See Mascott 454.  \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d was probably not a term of art that the Constitution used to signify some special type of official.  Based on how the Founders used it and similar terms, the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States\xe2\x80\x9d was merely a synonym for \xe2\x80\x9cfederal,\xe2\x80\x9d and the word \xe2\x80\x9cOffice[r]\xe2\x80\x9d carried its ordinary meaning.  See <i>id.,</i> at 471\xe2\x80\x93479.  The ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cofficer\xe2\x80\x9d was anyone who performed a continuous public duty.  See <i>id.,</i> at 484\xe2\x80\x93507; <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Maurice</i>, 26 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 1211, 1214 (No. 15,747) (CC Va. 1823) (defining officer as someone in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a public charge or employment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who performed a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing\xe2\x80\x9d duty); 8 Annals of Cong. 2304\xe2\x80\x932305 (1799) (statement of Rep.

The Founders considered individuals to be officers even if they performed only ministerial statutory duties\xe2\x80\x94including recordkeepers, clerks, and tidewaiters (individuals who watched goods land at a customhouse).  See Mascott 484\xe2\x80\x93507.  Early congressional practice reflected this understanding.  With exceptions not relevant here,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>] Congress required all fed- eral officials with ongoing statutory duties to be appointed in compliance with the Appointments Clause.  See <i>id.,</i> at 507\xe2\x80\x93545.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Applying the original meaning here, the administrative law judges of the Securities and Exchange Commission easily qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  These judges exercise many of the agency\xe2\x80\x99s statutory duties, including issuing initial decisions in adversarial proceedings.

As explained, the importance or significance of these statutory duties is irrelevant.  All that matters is that the judges are continuously responsible for performing them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In short, the administrative law judges of the Securities Exchange Commission are \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d under the original meaning of the Appointments Clause.

Tax Rev. 201, 204 (2014).  The lack of guidance is not without consequence.  \xe2\x80\x9c[Q]uestions about the Clause continue to arise regularly both in the operation of the Executive Branch and in proposed legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  31 Opinion of Office of Legal Counsel 73, 76 (2007) (Op. OLC).  This confusion can undermine the reliability and finality of proceedings and result in wasted resources.  See <i>ante, </i>at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (opinion of the Court) (ordering the Commission to grant petitioners a new administrative hearing).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the majority notes, see <i>ante,</i> at 5\xe2\x80\x936, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions currently set forth at least two prerequisites to officer status: (1) an individual must hold a \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuing\xe2\x80\x9d office established by law, <i>United States</i> v. <i>Germaine</i>,\n\n99 U.\xc2\xa0S. 508, 511\xe2\x80\x93512 (1879), and (2) an individual must wield \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 126 (1976) (<i>per curiam</i>).  The first requirement is relatively easy to grasp; the second, less so.  To be sure, to exercise \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority,\xe2\x80\x9d the person must wield considerable powers in comparison to the average person who works for the Federal Government.  As this Court has noted, the vast majority of those who work for the Federal Government are not \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Free Enterprise Fund</i> v. <i>Public Company Accounting Oversight Bd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, 506, n. 9 (2010) (indicating that well over 90% of those who render services to the Federal Government and are paid by it are not constitutional officers).  But this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions have yet to articulate the types of powers that will be deemed significant enough to constitute \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To provide guidance to Congress and the Executive Branch, I would hold that one requisite component of \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority\xe2\x80\x9d is the ability to make final, binding decisions on behalf of the Government.  Accordingly, a person who merely advises and provides recommendations to an officer would not herself qualify as an officer.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is some historical support for such a requirement.  For example, in 1822, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine opined in the \xe2\x80\x9cfullest early explication\xe2\x80\x9d of the meaning of an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98office,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the term \xe2\x80\x9coffice\xe2\x80\x9d implies a delegation of a portion of the sovereign power to, and possession of it by the person filling the office,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in its effects[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. will bind the rights of others.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  31 Op. OLC 83 (quoting 3 Greenl. (Me.) 481, 482).  In 1899, a Report of the Judiciary Committee of the House of Representatives noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe creation and conferring of an office involves a delegation to the individual of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. sovereign functions,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>i.e., </i>\xe2\x80\x9cthe power to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. legislate, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. execute law, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. hear and determine judicially questions submitted.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 A. Hinds, Precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States 607 (1907).  Those who merely assist others in exercising sovereign functions but who do not have the authority to exercise sovereign powers themselves do not wield significant authority.  <i>Id.,</i> at 607\xe2\x80\x93608.  Consequently, a person who possesses the \xe2\x80\x9cmere power to investigate some particular subject and report thereon\xe2\x80\x9d or to engage in negotiations \xe2\x80\x9cwithout [the] power to make binding\xe2\x80\x9d commitments on behalf of the Government is not an officer.  <i>Ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Confirming that final decisionmaking authority is a prerequisite to officer status would go a long way to aiding Congress and the Executive Branch in sorting out who is an officer and who is a mere employee.  At the threshold, Congress and the Executive Branch could rule out as an officer any person who investigates, advises, or recommends, but who has no power to issue binding policies, execute the laws, or finally resolve adjudicatory questions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Turning to the question presented here, it is true that the administrative law judges (ALJs) of the Securities and Exchange Commission wield \xe2\x80\x9cextensive powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 2.  They preside over adversarial proceedings that can lead to the imposition of significant penalties on private parties.  See <i>ante, </i>at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (noting that the proceedings in the present case resulted in the imposition of $300,000 in civil penalties, as well as a lifetime bar from the investment industry).  In the hearings over which they preside, Commission ALJs also exercise discretion with respect to important matters.  See <i>ante,</i> at 2 (discussing Commission ALJs\xe2\x80\x99 powers to supervise discovery, issue subpoenas, rule on the admissibility of evidence, hear and examine witnesses, and regulate the course of the proceedings).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nevertheless, I would hold that Commission ALJs are not officers because they lack final decisionmaking authority.  As the Commission explained below, the Commission retains \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plenary authority over the course of [its] administrative proceedings and the rulings of [its] law judges.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>In re Raymond J. Lucia Companies, Inc. &amp; Raymond J. Lucia, Sr.</i>, SEC Release No. 75837 (Sept. 3, 2015).

It can \xe2\x80\x9cmake any findings or conclusions that in its judgment are proper and on the basis of the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 CFR \xc2\xa7201.411(a) (2017).  The Commission is also in no way confined by the record initially developed by an ALJ.  The Commission can accept evidence itself or refer a matter to an ALJ to take additional evidence that the Commission deems relevant or necessary.  See <i>ibid.</i>; \xc2\xa7201.452.  In recent years, the Commission has accepted review in every case in which it was sought.  See R. Jackson, Fact and Fiction: The SEC\xe2\x80\x99s Oversight of Administrative Law Judges (Mar. 9, 2018), http://clsbluesky.law.columbia.edu/2018/03/09/fact-and-fiction- the-secs-oversight-of-administrative-law-judges/ (as last visited June 19, 2018).  Even where the Commission does not review an ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s initial decision, as in cases in which no party petitions for review and the Commission does not act <i>sua sponte</i>, the initial decision still only becomes final when the Commission enters a finality order.  17 CFR. \xc2\xa7201.360(d)(2).  And by operation of law, every action taken by an ALJ \xe2\x80\x9cshall, for all purposes, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be deemed the action of the <i>Commission</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U. S. C. \xc2\xa778d\xe2\x80\x931(c) (emphasis added).  In other words, Commission ALJs do not exercise significant authority because they do not, and cannot, enter final, binding decisions against the Government or third parties.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority concludes that this case is controlled by<i> Freytag</i> v. <i>Commissioner</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 868 (1991).  See <i>ante,</i> at 6.  In\xc2\xa0<i>Freytag</i>, the Court suggested that the Tax Court\xe2\x80\x99s special trial judges (STJs) acted as constitutional officers even in cases where they could not enter final, binding decisions.  In such cases, the Court noted, the STJs presided over adversarial proceedings in which they exercised \xe2\x80\x9csignificant discretion\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to \xe2\x80\x9cimportant functions,\xe2\x80\x9d such as ruling on the admissibility of evidence and hearing and examining witnesses.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0501 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i>\xc2\xa0at 881\xe2\x80\x93882.
