And <em>Teague </em>makes clear that its rule was tailored to the federal habeas context and thus had no bearing on whether States could provide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings.  Nothing in Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s general nonretroactivity rule discussion in <em>Teague </em>asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligible for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of a state agency or state court to extend a new rule\xe2\x80\x99s benefit to a broader class than she defined.  Her opinion also clearly indicates that <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>general nonretroactivity rule was an exercise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to interpret the federal habeas statute.  Since <em>Teague</em> is based on statutory authority that extends only to federal courts applying a federal statute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation on state courts.  The opinion\xe2\x80\x99s text and reasoning also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas petitions challenging state-court criminal convictions.  The federal interest in uniformity in the application of federal law does not outweigh the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees.  The <em>Teague </em>rule was intended to limit federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to overturn state convictions not to limit a state court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to grant relief for violations of new constitutional law rules when reviewing its own State\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.  Subsequent cases confirm this view.  See, <em>e.g., Beard</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/406/index.html">542 U. S. 406</a>, 412.

All other new rules of criminal procedure must be applied in future trials and in cases pending on direct review, but may not provide the basis for a federal collateral attack on a state-court conviction.  This is the substance of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Teague</em> rule\xe2\x80\x9d described by Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor in her plurality opinion in <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html"></a><a href="/us/489/288/index.html">489 U.

We have never suggested that it does, and now hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1996 a Minnesota jury found petitioner Stephen Danforth guilty of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.  See Minn. Stat. \xc2\xa7609.342, subd. 1(a) (1994).  The 6-year-old victim did not testify at trial, but the jury saw and heard a videotaped interview of the child.  On appeal from his conviction, Danforth argued that the tape\xe2\x80\x99s admission violated the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Applying the rule of admissibility set forth in <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a> (1980), the Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that the tape \xe2\x80\x9cwas sufficiently reliable to be admitted into evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d and affirmed the conviction.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Danforth</em>, 573 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 369, 375 (1997).  The conviction became final in 1998 when the Minnesota Supreme Court denied review and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s time for filing a writ of certiorari elapsed.  See <em>Caspari</em> v. <em>Bohlen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/383/index.html">510 U. S. 383</a>, 390 (1994).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction had become final, we announced a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d for evaluating the reliability of testimonial statements in criminal cases.  In <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a>, 68\xe2\x80\x9369 (2004), we held that where testimonial statements are at issue, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly thereafter, petitioner filed a state postconviction petition, in which he argued that he was entitled to a new trial because the admission of the taped interview violated the rule announced in <em>Crawford.</em>  Applying the standards set forth in <em>Teague, </em>the Minnesota trial court and the Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that <em>Crawford</em> did not apply to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case.  The State Supreme Court granted review to consider two arguments: (1) that the lower courts erred in holding that <em>Crawford </em>did not apply retroactively under <em>Teague;</em> and (2) that the state court was \xe2\x80\x9cfree to apply a broader retroactivity standard than that of <em>Teague</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and should apply the <em>Crawford</em> rule to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case even if federal law did not require it to do so.  718 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 451, 455 (2006).  The court rejected both arguments.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the second, the Minnesota court held that our decisions in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Payne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/index.html"></a><a href="/us/412/47/index.html">412 U.

S. ___ (2007)<em>, </em>makes clear that the Minnesota court correctly concluded that federal law does not <em>require</em> state courts to apply the holding in <em>Crawford </em>to cases that were final when that case<em> </em>was decided.  Nevertheless, we granted certiorari, 550 U. S. ___ (2007), to consider whether <em>Teague</em> or any other federal rule of law <em>prohibits</em> them from doing so.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with a comment on the source of the \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d announced in <em>Crawford.  </em>For much of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, federal constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x94such as the Sixth Amendment confrontation right at issue in <em>Crawford</em>\xe2\x80\x94were not binding on the States.  Federal law, in fact, imposed no constraints on the procedures that state courts could or should follow in imposing criminal sanctions on their citizens.  Neither the Federal Constitution as originally ratified nor any of the Amendments added by the Bill of Rights in 1791 gave this Court or any other federal-court power to review the fairness of state criminal procedures.  Moreover, before 1867 the statutory authority of federal district courts to issue writs of habeas corpus did not extend to convicted criminals in state custody.  See Act of Feb. 5, 1867, ch. 28, \xc2\xa71, 14 Stat. 385.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment radically changed the federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 relationship with state courts.  That Amendment, one of the post-Civil War Reconstruction Amendments ratified in 1868, is the source of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to decide whether a defendant in a state proceeding received a fair trial\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether his deprivation of liberty was \xe2\x80\x9cwithout due process of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa71 (\xe2\x80\x9c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  In construing that Amendment, we have held that it imposes minimum standards of fairness on the States, and requires state criminal trials to provide defendants with protections \xe2\x80\x9cimplicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Palko</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/302/319/index.html">302 U. S. 319</a>, 325 (1937).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Slowly at first, and then at an accelerating pace in the 1950\xe2\x80\x99s and 1960\xe2\x80\x99s, the Court held that safeguards afforded by the Bill of Rights\xe2\x80\x94including a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right \xe2\x80\x9cto be confronted with the witnesses against him\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are incorporated in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and are therefore binding upon the States.  See <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html"></a><a href="/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a> (1963) (applying the Sixth Amendment right to counsel to the States); <em>Pointer</em> v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/380/400/index.html">380 U. S. 400</a>, 403 (1965) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s right of an accused to confront the witnesses against him is likewise a fundamental right and is made obligatory on the States by the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Our interpretation of that basic Sixth Amendment right of confrontation has evolved over the years.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Crawford </em>we accepted the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation that we had previously endorsed in <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html"></a><a href="/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a>, needed reconsideration because it \xe2\x80\x9cstray[ed] from the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  541 U. S., at 42.  We \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ed] to the historical background of the Clause to understand its meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 43, and relied primarily on legal developments that had occurred prior to the adoption of the Sixth Amendment to derive the correct interpretation.  <em>Id.,</em> at 43\xe2\x80\x9350.   We held that the \xe2\x80\x9cConstitution prescribes a procedure for determining the reliability of testimony in criminal trials, and we, no less than the state courts, lack authority to replace it with one of our own devising.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 67.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, our opinion in <em>Crawford </em>announced a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94as that term is defined in <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x94because the result in that case \xe2\x80\x9cwas not <em>dictated</em> by precedent existing at the time the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Teague</em>, 489 U. S., at 301 (plurality opinion).  It was not, however, a rule \xe2\x80\x9cof our own devising\xe2\x80\x9d or the product of our own views about sound policy.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our decision today must also be understood against the backdrop of our somewhat confused and confusing \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d cases decided in the years between 1965 and 1987.  Indeed, we note at the outset that the very word \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d is misleading because it speaks in temporal terms.  \xe2\x80\x9cRetroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that when we declare that a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure is \xe2\x80\x9cnonretroactive,\xe2\x80\x9d we are implying that the right at issue was not in existence prior to the date the \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d was announced.  But this is incorrect.  As we have already explained, the source of a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule\xe2\x80\x9d is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law.  Accordingly, the underlying right necessarily pre-exists our articulation of the new rule.  What we are actually determining when we assess the \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Originally, criminal defendants whose convictions were final were entitled to federal habeas relief only if the court that rendered the judgment under which they were in custody lacked jurisdiction to do so.  <em>Ex parte Watkins</em>, 3 Pet. 193 (1830); <em>Ex parte Lange</em>, 18 Wall. 163, 176 (1874); <em>Ex parte Siebold</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/100/371/index.html">100 U.

In the early 1900\xe2\x80\x99s, however, such relief was only granted when the constitutional violation was so serious that it effectively<font b="1"> rendered the conviction void for lack of jurisdiction.

Nevertheless, until 1965 the Court continued to construe every constitutional error, including newly announced ones, as entitling state prisoners to relief on federal habeas.  \xe2\x80\x9cNew\xe2\x80\x9d constitutional rules of criminal procedure were, without discussion or analysis, routinely applied to cases on habeas review.

Adopting a practical approach, we held that the retroactive effect of each new rule should be determined on a case-by-case basis by examining the purpose of the rule, the reliance of the States on the prior law, and the effect on the administration of justice of retroactive application of the rule.  <em>Id.,</em> at 629.

S. 643</a> (1961), we held that the <em>Mapp </em>rule would not be given retroactive effect; it would not, in other words, be applied to convictions that were final before the date of the <em>Mapp</em> decision.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>Linkletter</em>, 381 U.

In <em>Teague</em>, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor reaffirmed <em>Griffith\xe2\x80\x99</em>s rejection of the <em>Linkletter</em> standard for determining the \xe2\x80\x9cretroactive\xe2\x80\x9d applicability of new rules to state convictions that were not yet final and rejected the <em>Linkletter</em> standard for cases pending on federal habeas review.

Although <em>Linkletter</em> arose on federal habeas, the opinion did not rely on that procedural posture as a factor in its holding or analysis.  Arguably, therefore, the approach it established might have been applied with equal force to both federal and state courts reviewing final state convictions.  But we did not state\xe2\x80\x94and the state courts did not conclude\xe2\x80\x94that <em>Linkletter </em>imposed such a limitation on the States.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A year after deciding <em>Linkletter</em>, we granted certiorari in <em>Johnson</em> to address the retroactivity of the rules announced in <em>Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U.

Applying the standard announced in <em>Linkletter</em>,<em> </em>we held that those rules should be applied only to trials that began after the respective dates of those decisions; they were given no retroactive effect beyond the parties in <em>Miranda</em> and <em>Escobedo</em> themselves.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, the Oregon Supreme Court decided to give retroactive effect to <em>Escobedo</em> despite our holding in <em>Johnson.</em>  In <em>State </em>v. <em>Fair</em>, 263 Ore. 383, 502 P.\xc2\xa02d 1150 (1972), the Oregon court noted that it was continuing to apply <em>Escobedo</em> retroactively and correctly stated that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are free to choose the degree of retroactivity or prospectivity which we believe appropriate to the particular rule under consideration, so long as we give federal constitutional rights at least as broad a scope as the United States Supreme Court requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 Ore., at 387\xe2\x80\x93388, 502 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1152.  In so holding, the Oregon court cited our language in <em>Johnson</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  263 Ore., at 386, 502 P.\xc2\xa02d, at 1151 (quoting <em>Johnson</em>, 384 U.

Unlike in <em>Linkletter</em>, however, this procedural posture was not merely a background fact in <em>Teague</em>.  A close reading of the <em>Teague</em> opinion makes clear that the rule it established was tailored to the unique context of federal habeas and therefore had no bearing on whether States could provide broader relief in their own postconviction proceedings than required by that opinion.  Because the case before us now does not involve either of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Teague </em>exceptions,\xe2\x80\x9d it is Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the general rule of nonretroactivity that merits the following three comments.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, not a word in Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s discussion\xe2\x80\x94or in either of the opinions of Justice Harlan that provided the blueprint for her entire analysis\xe2\x80\x94asserts or even intimates that her definition of the class eligible for relief under a new rule should inhibit the authority of any state agency or state court to extend the benefit of a new rule to a broader class than she defined.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion clearly indicates that <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to interpret the federal habeas statute.  Chapter 153 of Title 28 of the U. S. Code gives federal courts the authority to grant \xe2\x80\x9cwrits of habeas corpus,\xe2\x80\x9d but leaves unresolved many important questions about the scope of available relief.  This Court has interpreted that congressional silence\xe2\x80\x94along with the statute\xe2\x80\x99s command to dispose of habeas petitions \xe2\x80\x9cas law and justice require,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72243\xe2\x80\x94as an authorization to adjust the scope of the writ in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Brecht</em> v. <em>Abrahamson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/index.html">507 U. S. 619</a> (1993) (harmless-error standard); <em>McCleskey</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/467/index.html">499 U. S. 467</a> (1991) (abuse-of-the-writ bar to relief); <em>Wainwright</em> v. <em>Sykes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/72/index.html"></a><a href="/us/433/72/index.html">433 U. S. 72</a> (1977) (procedural default); <em>Stone</em> v. <em>Powell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/465/index.html">428 U. S. 465</a> (1976) (cognizability of Fourth Amendment claims).  <em>Teague </em>is plainly grounded in this authority, as the opinion expressly situated the rule it announced in this line of cases adjusting the scope of federal habeas relief in accordance with equitable and prudential considerations.  489 U. S., at 308 (plurality opinion) (citing, <em>inter alia</em>, <em>Wainwright</em> and <em>Stone</em>).[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Since <em>Teague</em> is based on statutory authority that extends only to federal courts applying a federal statute, it cannot be read as imposing a binding obligation on state courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the text and reasoning of Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also illustrate that the rule was meant to apply only to federal courts considering habeas corpus petitions challenging state-court criminal convictions.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor made numerous references to the \xe2\x80\x9cGreat writ\xe2\x80\x9d and the \xe2\x80\x9cwrit,\xe2\x80\x9d and expressly stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he relevant frame of reference\xe2\x80\x9d for determining the appropriate retroactivity rule is defined by \xe2\x80\x9cthe purposes for which the writ of habeas corpus is made available.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 306 (plurality opinion).  Moreover, she justified the general rule of nonretroactivity in part by reference to comity and respect for the finality of state convictions.  Federalism and comity considerations are unique to <em>federal</em> habeas review of state convictions.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State</em> v. <em>Preciose</em>, 129 N.\xc2\xa0J. 451, 475, 609 A.\xc2\xa02d 1280, 1292 (1992) (explaining that comity and federalism concerns \xe2\x80\x9csimply do not apply when this Court reviews procedural rulings by our lower courts\xe2\x80\x9d).  If anything, considerations of comity militate in favor of allowing state courts to grant habeas relief to a broader class of individuals than is required by <em>Teague</em>.  And while finality is, of course, implicated in the context of state as well as federal habeas, finality of state convictions is a <em>state</em> interest, not a federal one.  It is a matter that States should be free to evaluate, and weigh the importance of, when prisoners held in state custody are seeking a remedy for a violation of federal rights by their lower courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent correctly points out that <em>Teague</em> was also grounded in concerns over uniformity and the inequity inherent in the <em>Linkletter </em>approach.  There is, of course, a federal interest in \xe2\x80\x9creducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 12.  This interest in uniformity, however, does not outweigh the general principle that States are independent sovereigns with plenary authority to make and enforce their own laws as long as they do not infringe on federal constitutional guarantees.  The fundamental interest in federalism that allows individual States to define crimes, punishments, rules of evidence, and rules of criminal and civil procedure in a variety of different ways\xe2\x80\x94so long as they do not violate the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94is not otherwise limited by any general, undefined federal interest in uniformity.  Nonuniformity is, in fact, an unavoidable reality in a federalist system of government.  Any State could surely have adopted the rule of evidence defined in <em>Crawford </em>under state law even if that case had never been decided.  It should be equally free to give its citizens the benefit of our rule in any fashion that does not offend federal law.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is thus abundantly clear that the <em>Teague</em> rule of nonretroactivity was fashioned to achieve the goals of federal habeas while minimizing federal intrusion into state criminal proceedings.  It was intended to limit the authority of federal courts to overturn state convictions\xe2\x80\x94not to limit a state court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to grant relief for violations of new rules of constitutional law when reviewing its own State\xe2\x80\x99s convictions.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our subsequent cases, which characterize<font b="1"> the <em>Teague </em>rule as a standard limiting only the scope of <em>federal</em> habeas relief, confirm that <em>Teague</em> speaks only to the context of federal habeas.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Beard</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/406/index.html">542 U. S. 406</a>, 412 (2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s nonretroactivity principle acts as a limitation on the power of federal courts to grant habeas corpus relief to state prisoners\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks, ellipsis, and brackets omitted)); <em>Caspari</em>, 510 U.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cowell</em> v. <em>Leapley</em>, 458 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 514 (S. D. 1990); <em>Preciose</em>, 129 N.\xc2\xa0J. 451, 609 A.\xc2\xa02d 1280; <em>State ex rel.

As the Michigan Court explained, it had applied the new rule in the case before it in order to give guidance to Michigan trial courts concerning what it regarded as an ambiguity in <em>Pearce\xe2\x80\x99</em>s new rule.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  The Michigan Court did not purport to make a definitive ruling on the retroactivity of <em>Pearce;</em> nor did it purport to apply a broader state rule of retroactivity than required by federal law.  Our opinion in <em>Payne </em>did not require the Michigan Supreme Court to modify its disposition of the case; it simply remanded for further proceedings after providing the clarification that the Michigan Court sought.  Most significantly, other than the fact that the case was remanded for further proceedings, not a word in our <em>Payne </em>opinion suggests that the Court intended to prohibit state courts from applying new constitutional standards in a broader range of cases than we require.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, at least some state courts continued, after <em>Payne</em>, to adopt and apply broader standards of retroactivity than required by our decisions.  In <em>Pennsylvania </em>v.<em> McCormick</em>, 359 Pa. Super. 461, 470, 519 A.\xc2\xa02d 442, 447 (1986), for example, the Superior Court of Pennsylvania chose not to follow this Court\xe2\x80\x99s nonretroactivity holding in <em>Allen </em>v. <em>Hardy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/255/index.html">478 U.

Four Members of this Court dissented.  The dissenting opinion argued that the case actually raised both the substantive question whether the tax violated the Commerce Clause of the Federal Constitution and the remedial question whether, if so, the petitioners were entitled to a refund.  The dissent concluded as a matter of federal law that the tax was invalid during the years before <em>Scheiner</em>, and that petitioners were entitled to a decision to that effect.

Const., Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa7 1, which is not only the common and traditional one, but which is the only one that can justify courts in denying force and effect to the unconstitutional enactments of duly elected legislatures, see <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137 (1803)\xe2\x80\x94the very exercise of judicial power asserted in <em>Scheiner</em>.  To hold a governmental Act to be unconstitutional is not to announce that <em>we</em> forbid it, but that the <em>Constitution</em> forbids it; and when, as in this case, the constitutionality of a state statute is placed in issue, the question is not whether some decision of ours \xe2\x80\x98applies\xe2\x80\x99 in the way that a law applies; the question is whether the Constitution, as interpreted in that decision, invalidates the statute.  Since the Constitution does not change from year to year; since it does not conform to our decisions, but our decisions are supposed to conform to it; the notion that our interpretation of the Constitution in a particular decision could take prospective form does not make sense.  Either enforcement of the statute at issue in <em>Scheiner</em> (which occurred before our decision there) was unconstitutional, or it was not; if it was, then so is enforcement of all identical statutes in other States, whether occurring before or after our decision; and if it was not, then <em>Scheiner</em> was wrong, and the issue of whether to \xe2\x80\x98apply\xe2\x80\x99 that decision needs no further attention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 496 U. S., at 201.</p>\n<p align="left">\nBecause Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s vote rested on his disagreement with the substantive rule announced in <em>Scheiner</em>\xe2\x80\x94rather than with the retroactivity analysis in the dissenting opinion\xe2\x80\x94there were actually five votes supporting the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s views on the retroactivity issue.  Accordingly, it is the dissent rather than the plurality that should inform our analysis of the issue before us today.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, several years later, a majority of this Court explicitly adopted the <em>Smith</em> dissent\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Harper</em> v. <em>Virginia Dept. of Taxation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/86/index.html">509 U. S. 86</a> (1993).  <em>Harper</em>, like <em>Smith</em>, involved a request for a refund of taxes paid before we declared a similar Michigan tax unconstitutional.  We held that the Virginia tax at issue in <em>Harper</em> was in fact invalid\xe2\x80\x94even before we declared the similar tax unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94but that this did not necessarily entitle the petitioners to a full refund.  We explained that the Constitution required Virginia to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98provide relief consistent with federal due process principles,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 509 U. S., at 100 (citing <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v.<em> Smith,</em> 496 U. S., at 181), but that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a State found to have imposed an impermissibly discriminatory tax retains flexibility in responding to this determination\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the due process clause, 509 U. S., at 100 (citing <em>McKesson Corp. </em>v. <em>Division of</em> <em>Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, Fla. Dept. of Business Regulation, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/18/index.html">496 U. S. 18</a>, 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (1990)).  We left to the \xe2\x80\x9cVirginia courts this question of state law and the performance of other tasks pertaining to the crafting of any appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  509 U. S., at 102.  And we specifically noted that Virginia \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is free to choose which form of relief it will provide, so long as that relief satisfies the minimum federal requirements we have outlined.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(citing <em>McKesson</em>, 496 U.

S., at 102 (\xe2\x80\x9cState law may provide relief beyond the demands of federal due process, but under no circumstances may it confine petitioners to a lesser remedy\xe2\x80\x9d citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, to the extent that these civil retroactivity decisions are relevant to the issue before us today,[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>] they support our conclusion that the remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law.  Federal law simply \xe2\x80\x9csets certain minimum requirements that States must meet but may exceed in providing appropriate relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 496 U. S., at 178\xe2\x80\x93179 (plurality opinion).  They provide no support for the proposition that federal law places a limit on state authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations.</p>\n<p align="left">VI</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, while the State acknowledges that it may grant its citizens broader protection than the Federal Constitution requires by enacting appropriate legislation or by judicial interpretation of its own Constitution, it argues that it may not do so by judicial misconstruction of federal law.  <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Hass</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/714/index.html"></a><a href="/us/420/714/index.html">420 U. S. 714</a> (1975)\xe2\x80\x94like our early decisions in <em>Ableman</em> v. <em>Booth</em>, 21 How. 506 (1859), and <em>Tarble\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 13 Wall. 397 (1872)\xe2\x80\x94provides solid support for that proposition.  But the States that give broader retroactive effect to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rules of criminal procedure do not do so by misconstruing the federal <em>Teague </em>standard.  Rather, they have developed <em>state </em>law to govern retroactivity in state postconviction proceedings.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>State </em>v. <em>Whitfield</em>, 107 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 253, 268 (Mo. 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]s a matter of state law, this Court chooses not to adopt the <em>Teague</em> analysis . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  The issue in this case is whether there is a federal rule, either implicitly announced in <em>Teague</em>, or in some other source of federal law, that prohibits them from doing so.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of any precedent for the claim that <em>Teague </em>limits state collateral review courts\xe2\x80\x99 authority to provide remedies for federal constitutional violations is a sufficient reason for concluding that there is no such rule of federal law.  That conclusion is confirmed by several additional considerations.  First, if there is such a federal rule of law, presumably the Supremacy Clause in Article V of the Federal Constitution would require all state entities\xe2\x80\x94not just state judges\xe2\x80\x94to comply with it.  We have held<font b="1"> that States can waive a <em>Teague</em> defense, during the course of litigation, by expressly choosing not to rely on it, see <em>Collins</em> v. <em>Youngblood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/37/index.html">497 U. S. 37</a>, 41 (1990), or by failing to raise it in a timely manner, see <em>Schiro</em> v. <em>Farley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/222/index.html">510 U. S. 222</a>, 228\xe2\x80\x93229 (1994).  It would indeed be anomalous to hold that state legislatures and executives are not bound by <em>Teague</em>, but that state courts are.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the State has not identified, and we cannot discern, the source of our authority to promulgate such a novel rule of federal law.  While we have ample authority to control the administration of justice in the federal courts\xe2\x80\x94particularly in their enforcement of federal legislation\xe2\x80\x94we have no comparable supervisory authority over the work of state judges.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>Fankell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/911/index.html">520 U. S. 911</a> (1997).  And while there are federal interests that occasionally justify this Court\xe2\x80\x99s development of common-law rules of federal law,[<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] our normal role is to interpret law created by others and \xe2\x80\x9cnot to prescribe what it shall be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 496 U. S., at 201 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Just as constitutional doubt may tip the scales in favor of one construction of a statute rather than another, so does uncertainty about the source of authority to impose a federal limit on the power of state judges to remedy wrongful state convictions outweigh any possible policy arguments favoring the rule that respondent espouses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dissent contends that the \xe2\x80\x9cend result [of this opinion] is startling\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9ctwo criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d could obtain different results.  <em>Post,</em> at 1.  This assertion ignores the fact that the two hypothetical criminal defendants did not actually commit the \xe2\x80\x9csame crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  They violated different state laws, were tried in and by different state sovereigns, and may\xe2\x80\x94for many reasons\xe2\x80\x94be subject to different penalties.  As previously noted, such nonuniformity is a necessary consequence of a federalist system of government.</p>\n<p align="left">VII</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cnew rules\xe2\x80\x9d of constitutional law is primarily concerned, not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies.  The former is a \xe2\x80\x9cpure question of federal law, our resolution of which should be applied uniformly throughout the Nation, while the latter is a mixed question of state and federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, 496 U. S., at 205 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A decision by this Court that a new rule does not apply retroactively under <em>Teague</em> does not imply that there was no right and thus no violation of that right at the time of trial\xe2\x80\x94only that no remedy will be provided in federal habeas courts.  It is fully consistent with a government of laws to recognize that the finality of a judgment may bar relief.  It would be quite wrong to assume, however, that the question whether constitutional violations occurred in trials conducted before a certain date depends on how much time was required to complete the appellate process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the judgment of the Supreme Court of Minnesota is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.  As was true in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Payne, </em>the Minnesota Court is free to reinstate its judgment disposing of the petition for state postconviction relief.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although <em>Teague</em> was a plurality opinion that drew support from only four Members of the Court, the <em>Teague</em> rule was affirmed and applied by a majority of the Court shortly thereafter.

This Court has held that the question whether a particular ruling is retroactive is itself a question of federal law.  It is basic that when it comes to any such question of federal law, it is \xe2\x80\x9cthe province and duty\xe2\x80\x9d of this Court \xe2\x80\x9cto say what the law is.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Marbury</em> v. <em>Madison</em>, 1 Cranch 137, 177 (1803).  State courts are the final arbiters of their own state law; this Court is the final arbiter of federal law.  State courts are therefore bound by our rulings on whether our cases construing federal law are retroactive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority contravenes these bedrock propositions.  The end result is startling: Of two criminal defendants, each of whom committed the same crime, at the same time, whose convictions became final on the same day, and each of whom raised an identical claim at the same time under the Federal Constitution, one may be executed while the other is set free\xe2\x80\x94the first despite being correct on his claim, and the second because of it.  That result is contrary to the Supremacy Clause and the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 decision to vest in \xe2\x80\x9cone supreme Court\xe2\x80\x9d the responsibility and authority to ensure the uniformity of federal law.  Because the Constitution requires us to be more jealous of that responsibility and authority, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One year after <em>Teague</em> v. <em>Lane</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/index.html">489 U.

When questions of state law are at issue, state courts generally have the authority to determine the retroactivity of their own decisions.  The retroactive applicability of a constitutional decision of this Court, however, \xe2\x80\x98is every bit as much of a federal question as what particular federal constitutional provisions themselves mean, what they guarantee, and whether they have been denied.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/index.html"></a><a href="/us/496/167/index.html">496 U.

S., at 178 (citing <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Payne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/47/index.html"></a><a href="/us/412/47/index.html">412 U. S. 47</a> (1973), and <em>Arsenault</em> v. <em>Massachusetts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/5/index.html"></a><a href="/us/393/5/index.html">393 U. S. 5</a> (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em>).  Even more recently, we held that the \xe2\x80\x9cSupremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harper</em> v. <em>Virginia Dept. of Taxation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/86/index.html">509 U. S. 86</a>, 100 (1993) (citation omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, about the only point on which our retroactivity jurisprudence has been consistent is that the retroactivity of new federal rules is a question of federal law binding on States.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary holding is based on a misreading of our precedent and a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court correctly points out, before 1965 we took for granted the proposition that all federal constitutional rights, including rights that represented a break from earlier precedent, would be given full retroactive effect on both direct and collateral review.  That all changed with <em>Linkletter</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/index.html">381 U. S. 618</a> (1965).  In that case, a Louisiana prisoner brought a federal habeas petition arguing that illegally seized evidence was introduced against him at trial in violation of <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a> (1961).  <em>Mapp</em>, however, had been decided after his conviction became final.  We granted certiorari to decide whether the <em>Mapp</em> rule \xe2\x80\x9coperates retrospectively upon cases finally decided in the period prior to <em>Mapp</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  381 U. S., at 619\xe2\x80\x93620.  In answering this question, we broke from our past practice of assuming full retroactivity, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwe are neither required to apply, nor prohibited from applying, a decision retrospectively.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 629.  Our analysis turned entirely on the nature and scope of the particular constitutional right at issue: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e must \xe2\x80\xa6 weigh the merits and demerits [of retroactive application] in each case by looking to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under this framework, we held that <em>Mapp</em> would apply only prospectively.  381 U. S., at 639\xe2\x80\x93640.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next year, we decided <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/index.html">384 U. S. 719</a> (1966).  <em>Johnson</em> was a direct appeal from the New Jersey Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of <em>state</em> collateral relief.  The precise question in <em>Johnson</em> was whether the rules announced in <em>Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U. S. 478</a> (1964), and <em>Miranda</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), would apply to state prisoners whose convictions had become final before those cases were decided.  In holding that <em>Escobedo</em> and <em>Miranda</em> should apply only prospectively, 384 U. S., at 732, we imported <em>Linkletter</em>\xe2\x80\x99s mode of retroactivity analysis into review of state postconviction proceedings, 384 U. S., at 726\xe2\x80\x93727.  Finally, in <em>Stovall</em> v. <em>Denno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/index.html">388 U. S. 293</a> (1967), we announced that, for purposes of retroactivity analysis, \xe2\x80\x9cno distinction is justified between convictions now final, as in the instant case, and convictions at various stages of trial and direct review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 300.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, by 1967, the <em>Linkletter</em> analysis was applied in review of criminal convictions, whether final or not.  No matter at what stage of proceedings this Court considered a retroactivity question, the issue was decided with reference to the purposes and practical impact of the precise federal right in question: \xe2\x80\x9cEach constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the [constitutional] dictate involved.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 728.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the question of retroactivity was so tied up with the nature and purpose of the underlying federal constitutional right, it would have been surprising if any of our cases had suggested that States were free to apply new rules of federal constitutional law retroactively even when we would not.  As one of the more thoughtful legal scholars put it in discussing the effect of the <em>Linkletter</em> analysis on state collateral review, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f a state gave relief in such a case on the exclusive authority of <em>Mapp</em>, under the rationale of the <em>Linkletter</em> opinion it would presumably have been reversed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mishkin, Foreword: The High Court, The Great Writ, and the Due Process of Time and Law, 79 Harv. L. Rev. 56, 91, n. 132 (1965).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our precedents made clear that States could give greater substantive protection under their own laws than was available under federal law, and could give whatever retroactive effect to <em>those</em> laws they wished.  As the Court explained in <em>Johnson</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[o]f course, States are still entirely free to effectuate under their own law stricter<em> </em>standards than those we have laid down and to apply those standards in a broader range of cases than is required by this decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 733.  The clear implication of this statement was that States could apply their own retroactivity rules only to new substantive rights \xe2\x80\x9cunder their own law,\xe2\x80\x9d not to new federal rules announced by this Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, contrary to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, our early retroactivity cases nowhere suggested that the retroactivity of new federal constitutional rules of criminal procedure was anything other than \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Daniel</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/31/index.html">420 U. S. 31</a>, 32 (1975) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  It is no surprise, then, that when we held that a particular right would not apply retroactively, the language in our opinions did not indicate that our decisions were optional.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Fuller</em> v. <em>Alaska</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/80/index.html">393 U. S. 80</a>, 81 (1968) <em>(per curiam)</em> (the rule announced in <em>Lee</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/378/index.html">392 U. S. 378</a> (1968), \xe2\x80\x9c<em>is to be applied</em> only to trials in which the evidence is sought to be introduced after the date of [that] decision\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  And, of course, when we found that a state court erred in holding that a particular right should not apply retroactively, the state court was bound to comply.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Kitchens</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/847/index.html">401 U. S. 847</a> (1971) <em>(per curiam)</em>; <em>McConnell</em> v. <em>Rhay</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/393/2/index.html">393 U.

In considering this question, the state court noted that this Court had \xe2\x80\x9cnot yet decided whether <em>Pearce</em> is to be applied retroactively.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People</em> v. <em>Payne</em>, 386 Mich. 84, 90, n.\xc2\xa03, 191 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 375, 378, n.\xc2\xa02 (1971).  Nevertheless, without so much as citing any federal retroactivity precedent, the court decided that it would \xe2\x80\x9capply <em>Pearce</em> in the present case in order to instruct our trial courts as to the Michigan interpretation of an ambiguous portion of <em>Pearce </em>\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, pending clarification by the United States Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 91, n.\xc2\xa03, 191 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 378, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari in <em>Payne </em>only on the question of retroactivity, and decided that <em>Pearce</em> should not apply retroactively.  In reversing the contrary decision of the state court, our language was not equivocal: \xe2\x80\x9cSince the resentencing hearing in this case took place approximately two years before <em>Pearce</em> was decided, we hold that the Michigan Supreme Court erred in applying its proscriptions here.\xe2\x80\x9d  412 U. S., at 57.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority argues that <em>Payne</em> did not preclude States from applying retroactivity rules different from those we announced; rather, the argument goes, the Michigan Supreme Court simply elected to follow the federal retroactivity rule, \xe2\x80\x9cpending clarification.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9320.  That is certainly a possible reading of <em>Payne</em>, but not the most plausible one.  The Michigan Supreme Court did not purport to rest its decision to apply <em>Pearce</em> retroactively on the federal <em>Linkletter</em> analysis, and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s reversal is most reasonably read as <em>requiring</em> state courts to apply our federal retroactivity decisions.  Notably, this is not the first time Members of this Court have debated the meaning of <em>Payne</em>, with <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s author explaining that <em>Payne</em> supports the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have consistently required that state courts adhere to our retroactivity decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>American Trucking</em>, 496 U. S., at 178 (plurality opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.), and the author of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion disagreeing in dissent, see <em>id.</em>, at 210, n.\xc2\xa04 (opinion of Stevens, J.).  But whichever way <em>Payne</em> is read, it either offers no support for the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position, because the state court simply applied federal retroactivity rules, or flatly rejects the majority\xe2\x80\x99s position, because the state court failed to apply federal retroactivity rules, and was told by this Court that it must.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Meanwhile, Justice Harlan had begun dissenting in our retroactivity cases, pressing the view that new rules announced by the Court should be applied in all cases not yet final, without regard to the analysis set forth in <em>Linkletter</em>.  See <em>Desist</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/index.html">394 U. S. 244</a>, 256\xe2\x80\x93269 (1969); <em>Mackey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/index.html">401 U. S. 667</a>, 675\xe2\x80\x93702 (1971) (opinion concurring in judgments in part and dissenting in part).  In <em>Griffith</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a> (1987), we abandoned <em>Linkletter</em> as it applied to cases still on direct review and adopted Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s view in such cases.  Noting that nonretroactivity on direct appeal \xe2\x80\x9cviolates basic norms of constitutional adjudication\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cselective application of new rules violates the principle of treating similarly situated defendants the same,\xe2\x80\x9d 479 U. S., at 322, 323, we held that \xe2\x80\x9ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, <em>state or federal</em>, pending on direct review or not yet final,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 328 (emphasis added).  Just as in previous cases, <em>Griffith</em> by its terms bound state courts to apply our retroactivity decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two years after <em>Griffith</em> was decided, we granted certiorari in <em>Yates</em> v. <em>Aiken</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/211/index.html">484 U. S. 211</a> (1988).  In that case, a South Carolina state habeas court had decided that our decision in <em>Francis</em> v. <em>Franklin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/307/index.html">471 U. S. 307</a> (1985), should not be applied retroactively.  If the authority of state courts to apply their own retroactivity rules were well established under our precedents\xe2\x80\x94as the majority would have it, see <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9312\xe2\x80\x94this case should have been easily decided on the ground that whatever the federal retroactivity rule, the State could adopt its own rule on the retroactivity of newly announced federal constitutional standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead, the State argued to this Court \xe2\x80\x9cthat we should adopt Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s theory that a newly announced constitutional rule should not be applied retroactively to cases pending on collateral review unless\xe2\x80\x9d the rule meets certain criteria\xe2\x80\x94the flip side of Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s view about cases on direct review that we had accepted in <em>Griffith</em>.  484 U. S., at 215.  Under that approach, the State argued, <em>Francis </em>would not be applied retroactively on collateral review.  484 U. S., at 215.  In response, we discussed Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdistinction between direct review and collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  We found, however, that it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot necessary to determine whether we should \xe2\x80\xa6 adopt Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning as to the retroactivity of cases announcing new constitutional rules to cases pending on collateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 215\xe2\x80\x93216, because <em>Francis</em> did not announce a new rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court went on, however, to address South Carolina\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument\xe2\x80\x94that it \xe2\x80\x9chas the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d which would allow it in the case before the Court \xe2\x80\x9cto refuse to apply a new rule of federal constitutional law retroactively in such a proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  484 U. S., at 217.  This argument should sound familiar\xe2\x80\x94whatever the federal retroactivity rule, a State may establish its own retroactivity rule for its own collateral proceedings.  This Court rejected that proposition, not only because it did not regard <em>Francis</em> as a new rule, but also because the state court did not \xe2\x80\x9cplac[e] any limit on the issues that it will entertain in collateral proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  484 U. S., at 218.  As this Court explained, if the state court \xe2\x80\x9cconsider[s] the merits of the federal claim, it has a duty to grant the relief that <em>federal law </em>requires.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given all this, the present case should come out the way it does only if <em>Teague</em> changed the nature of retroactivity as a creature of federal law binding on the States, and adopted the argument rejected in <em>Yates</em>\xe2\x80\x94that when it comes to retroactivity, a State \xe2\x80\x9chas the authority to establish the scope of its own habeas corpus proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Teague</em> did no such thing.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Teague</em>, we completed the project of conforming our view on the retroactivity of new rules of criminal procedure to those of Justice Harlan.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s plurality opinion posed the problem by noting, with more than a bit of understatement, that the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Linkletter</em> retroactivity standard has not led to consistent results.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 302.  In light of these concerns, and because of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the important distinction between direct review and collateral review,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 307 (quoting <em>Yates</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 215), we generally adopted Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s approach to retroactivity on collateral review, 489 U. S., at 310, just as we had previously adopted his approach on direct review in <em>Griffith</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Linkletter</em> approach to retroactivity was thus overruled in favor of the Harlan approach in two steps: <em>Griffith</em> and <em>Teague</em>.  There is no dispute that <em>Griffith</em> is fully binding on States; a new rule \xe2\x80\x9cis to be applied retroactively to all cases, <em>state or federal</em>, pending on direct review or not yet final.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 U. S., at 328 (emphasis added).  <em>Teague</em> is simply the other side of the coin, and it too should be binding in \xe2\x80\x9call cases, state or federal.\xe2\x80\x9d  The fact that <em>Linkletter</em> was overruled in two stages rather than one should not lead to a different result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, <em>Teague </em>did not purport to distinguish between federal and state collateral review.  Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion noted that \xe2\x80\x9cin <em>Yates</em> v. <em>Aiken</em>, we were asked to decide whether the rule announced in <em>Francis </em>v.<em> Franklin</em>, should be applied to a defendant on collateral review at the time that case was decided,\xe2\x80\x9d but that we were able to decide the case on alternative grounds.  489 U. S., at 307 (citations omitted).  This citation of <em>Yates</em>\xe2\x80\x94a state habeas case\xe2\x80\x94makes clear that <em>Teague</em> contemplated no difference between retroactivity of new federal rules in state and federal collateral proceedings.  Thus, our unqualified holding\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless they fall within an exception to the general rule, new constitutional rules of criminal procedure will not be applicable to those cases which have become final before the new rules are announced,\xe2\x80\x9d 489 U. S., at 310\xe2\x80\x94is enough to decide this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the reasons the <em>Teague</em> Court provided for adopting Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s view apply to state as well as federal collateral review.  The majority is quite right that <em>Teague</em> invoked the interest in comity between the state and federal sovereigns.  <em>Id.</em>, at 308.  But contrary to the impression conveyed by the majority, there was more to <em>Teague </em>than that.  <em>Teague</em> also relied on the interest in finality: \xe2\x80\x9cApplication of constitutional rules not in existence at the time a conviction became final seriously undermines the principle of finality which is essential to the operation of our criminal justice system.  Without finality, the criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 309.  The Court responds by flatly stating that \xe2\x80\x9cfinality of state convictions is a <em>state</em> interest, not a federal one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.  But while it is certainly true that finality of state convictions is a state interest, that does mean it is not also a federal one.  After all, our decision in <em>Griffith </em>made finality the touchstone for retroactivity of new federal rules, and bound States to that judgment.  See 479 U. S., at 328 (new rules are \xe2\x80\x9cto be applied retroactively to all cases, <em>state or federal</em>, pending on direct review or not yet final\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is quite a radical proposition to assert that this Court has nothing to say about an interest \xe2\x80\x9cessential to the operation of our criminal justice system,\xe2\x80\x9d without which \xe2\x80\x9cthe criminal law is deprived of much of its deterrent effect,\xe2\x80\x9d when the question is whether this interest is being undermined by the very rules of <em>federal</em> constitutional procedure that we are charged with expounding.  A State alone may \xe2\x80\x9cevaluate, and weigh the importance of\xe2\x80\x9d finality interests, <em>ante</em>, at 15, when it decides which substantive rules of criminal procedure <em>state law</em> affords; it is quite a leap to hold, as the Court does, that they alone can do so in the name of the Federal Constitution.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Teague</em> was also based on the inequity of the <em>Linkletter</em> approach to retroactivity.  After noting that the disparate treatment of similarly situated defendants led us in <em>Griffith</em> to adopt Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s view for cases on direct appeal, the Court then explained that the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Linkletter</em> standard also led to unfortunate disparity in the treatment of similarly situated defendants on collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  489 U. S., at 305.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 316 (the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new approach to retroactivity \xe2\x80\x9cavoids the inequity resulting from the uneven application of new rules to similarly situated defendants\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This interest in reducing the inequity of haphazard retroactivity standards and disuniformity in the application of federal law is quite plainly a predominantly federal interest.  Indeed, it was one of the main reasons we cited in <em>Griffith</em> for imposing a uniform rule of retroactivity upon <em>state</em> courts for cases on direct appeal.  And, more to the point, it is the very interest that animates the Supremacy Clause and our role as the \xe2\x80\x9cone supreme Court\xe2\x80\x9d charged with enforcing it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Story, writing for the Court, noted nearly two centuries ago that the Constitution requires \xe2\x80\x9c<em>uniformity</em> of decisions throughout the whole United States, upon all subjects within [its] purview.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Martin</em> v. <em>Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Lessee</em>, 1 Wheat. 304, 347\xe2\x80\x93348 (1816).  Indeed, the \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental principle\xe2\x80\x9d of our Constitution, as Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor once put it, is \xe2\x80\x9cthat a single sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s law should be applied equally to all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Our Judicial Federalism, 35 Case W. Res. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 4 (1985).  States are free to announce their own state-law rules of criminal procedure, and to apply them retroactively in whatever manner they like.  That is fully consistent with the principle that \xe2\x80\x9ca single sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s law should be applied equally to all.\xe2\x80\x9d  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion invites just the sort of disuniformity in federal law that the Supremacy Clause was meant to prevent.  The same determination of a federal constitutional violation at the same stage in the criminal process can result in freedom in one State and loss of liberty or life in a neighboring State.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion allows \xe2\x80\x9ca single sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the Federal Constitution, as interpreted by this Court\xe2\x80\x94to be applied differently in every one of the several States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, from <em>Linkletter</em> through <em>Johnson</em> to <em>Teague</em>, we have always emphasized that determining whether a new federal right is retroactive turns on the nature of the substantive federal rule at issue.  See <em>Linkletter</em>, 381 U. S., at 629 (in deciding retroactivity, we \xe2\x80\x9cloo[k] to the prior history of the rule in question, its purpose and effect, and whether retrospective operation will further or retard its operation\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Johnson</em>, 384 U. S., at 728 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach constitutional rule of criminal procedure has its own distinct functions, its own background of precedent, and its own impact on the administration of justice, and the way in which these factors combine [to decide the retroactivity issue] must inevitably vary with the dictate involved\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Teague, supra</em>, at 311\xe2\x80\x93315 (deciding whether rule is applicable to cases on collateral review turns on whether the rule \xe2\x80\x9cplaces \xe2\x80\x98certain kinds of primary, private individual conduct beyond the power of the criminal law-making authority to proscribe,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and whether the rule is an \xe2\x80\x9cabsolute prerequisite to fundamental fairness that is \xe2\x80\x98implicit in the concept of ordered liberty\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is how we determine retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94by carefully examining the underlying federal right.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Whorton</em> v. <em>Bockting</em>, 549 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2007) (slip op., at 11\xe2\x80\x9314); <em>Schriro</em> v. <em>Summerlin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/348/index.html">542 U. S. 348</a>, 353\xe2\x80\x93354 (2004); <em>Sawyer</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/227/index.html">497 U. S. 227</a>, 243\xe2\x80\x93245 (1990); <em>Penry</em> v. <em>Lynaugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/302/index.html">492 U. S. 302</a>, 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When this Court decides that a particular right shall not be applied retroactively, but a state court finds that it should, it is at least in part because of a different assessment by the state court of the nature of the underlying federal right\xe2\x80\x94something on which the Constitution gives this Court the final say.  The nature and scope of the new rules we announce directly determines whether they will be applied retroactively on collateral review.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion stands for the unfounded proposition that while we alone have the final say in expounding the former, we have no control over the latter.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is not only based on a misreading of our retroactivity cases, but also on a misunderstanding of the nature of retroactivity generally.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision is grounded on the erroneous view that retroactivity is a remedial question.  See <em>ante</em>, at 26\xe2\x80\x9327 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is important to keep in mind that our jurisprudence concerning the \xe2\x80\x98retroactivity\xe2\x80\x99 of \xe2\x80\x98new rules\xe2\x80\x99 of constitutional law is primarily concerned, not with the question whether a constitutional violation occurred, but with the availability or nonavailability of remedies\xe2\x80\x9d).  But as explained in the lead opinion in <em>American Trucking</em>\xe2\x80\x94penned by the author of the lead opinion in <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x94it is an \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cequat[e] a decision not to apply a rule retroactively with the judicial choice of a remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  496 U. S., at 194 (plurality opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.).  As Justice O\xe2\x80\x99Connor went on to emphasize,<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9c[n]or do this Court\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity decisions, whether in the civil or criminal sphere, support the \xe2\x80\xa6 assertion that our retroactivity doctrine is a remedial principle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9cWhile application of the principles of retroactivity may have remedial effects, they are not themselves remedial principles\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. A decision defining the operative conduct or events that will be adjudicated under old law does not, in itself, specify an appropriate remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 195.  See also <em>Lemon</em> v. <em>Kurtzman</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/411/192/index.html">411 U. S. 192</a>, 199 (1973) (plurality opinion) (describing the question of retroactivity as \xe2\x80\x9cwhether we will apply a new constitutional rule of criminal law in reviewing judgments of conviction obtained under a prior standard,\xe2\x80\x9d and contrasting this with the question of the \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate scope of federal equitable remedies\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, when we ask whether and to what extent a rule will be retroactively applied, we are asking what law\xe2\x80\x94new or old\xe2\x80\x94will apply.  As we have expressly noted, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>Teague</em> doctrine \xe2\x80\xa6 does not involve a special \xe2\x80\x98remedial\xe2\x80\x99 limitation on the principle of \xe2\x80\x98retroactivity\xe2\x80\x99 as much as it reflects a limitation inherent in the principle itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reynoldsville Casket Co.</em> v. <em>Hyde</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/749/index.html">514 U. S. 749</a>, 758 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing prompts a lengthy rejoinder from the Court, to the effect that it is wrong to view retroactivity as a federal choice-of-law question rather than a remedial one.  That view, we are told, was rejected by five Justices in <em>American Trucking</em> and then by the Court in <em>Harper</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 20\xe2\x80\x9324.  But the proposition on which five Members of the Court agreed in <em>American Trucking</em>, and that the Court adopted in <em>Harper</em>, was that the <em>Griffith</em> rule of retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94that is, that newly announced constitutional decisions should apply to all cases on direct review\xe2\x80\x94should apply to civil cases as well as criminal.  See <em>American Trucking</em>, 496 U. S., at 201 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9cI share Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 perception that prospective decisionmaking is incompatible with the judicial role, which is to say what the law is, not to prescribe what it shall be\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 212 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cFundamental notions of fairness and legal process dictate that the same rules should be applied to all similar cases on direct review\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Harper</em>, 509 U.

That is why, the year after <em>American Trucking </em>was decided, two of the Justices in today\xe2\x80\x99s majority could explain:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSince the question is whether the court should apply the old rule or the new one, retroactivity is properly seen in the first instance as a matter of choice of law, \xe2\x80\x98a choice \xe2\x80\xa6 between the principle of forward operation and that of relation backward.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Great Northern R. Co.</em> v. <em>Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/358/index.html">287 U. S. 358</a>, 364 (1932).  Once a rule is found to apply \xe2\x80\x98backward,\xe2\x80\x99 there may then be a further issue of remedies, <em>i.e.</em>, whether the party prevailing under a new rule should obtain the same relief that would have been awarded if the rule had been an old one.  Subject to possible constitutional thresholds, the remedial inquiry is one governed by state law, at least where the case originates in state court.

Quite the contrary: <em>Harper</em> held that the \xe2\x80\x9cSupremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law,\xe2\x80\x9d 509 U. S., at 100 (citation omitted), and expressly treated retroactivity and remedy as separate questions, <em>id.</em>, at 100\xe2\x80\x93102.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority explains that when we announce a new rule of law, we are not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>creating</em> the law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>declaring</em> what the law already is.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 21 (quoting <em>American Trucking</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 201 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment)).  But this has nothing to do with the question before us.  The point may lead to the conclusion that nonretroactivity of our decisions is improper\xe2\x80\x94the position the Court has adopted in both criminal and civil cases on direct review\xe2\x80\x94but everyone agrees that full retroactivity is not required on collateral review.  It necessarily follows that we must choose whether \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d law applies to a particular category of cases.  Suppose, for example, that a defendant, whose conviction became final before we announced our decision in <em>Crawford</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/36/index.html">541 U. S. 36</a> (2004), argues (correctly) on collateral review that he was convicted in violation of both <em>Crawford</em> and <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Roberts</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/448/56/index.html">448 U. S. 56</a> (1980), the case that <em>Crawford </em>overruled.  Under our decision in <em>Whorton</em> v. <em>Bockting</em>, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), the \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d rule announced in <em>Crawford</em> would not apply retroactively to the defendant.  But I take it to be uncontroversial that the defendant would nevertheless get the benefit of the \xe2\x80\x9cold\xe2\x80\x9d rule of <em>Roberts</em>, even under the view that the rule not only is but always has been an incorrect reading of the Constitution.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Yates</em>, 484 U. S., at 218.  Thus, the question whether a particular federal rule will apply retroactively is, in a very real way, a choice between new and old law.  The issue in this case is who should decide.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proposition that the question of retroactivity\xe2\x80\x94that is, the choice between new or old law in a particular case\xe2\x80\x94is distinct from the question of remedies has several important implications for this case.  To begin with, whatever intuitive appeal may lie in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9cthe remedy a state court chooses to provide its citizens for violations of the Federal Constitution is primarily a question of state law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 24, the statement misses the mark.  The relevant inquiry is not about remedy; it is about choice of law\xe2\x80\x94new or old.  There is no reason to believe, either legally or intuitively, that States should have any authority over this question when it comes to which <em>federal</em> constitutional rules of criminal procedure to apply.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, when the question is what federal rule of decision from this Court should apply to a particular case, no Court but this one\xe2\x80\x94which has the ultimate authority \xe2\x80\x9cto say what the law is,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Marbury</em>, 1 Cranch, at 177\xe2\x80\x94should have final say over the answer.  See <em>Harper</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 100 (\xe2\x80\x9cSupremacy Clause does not allow federal retroactivity doctrine to be supplanted by the invocation of a contrary approach to retroactivity under state law\xe2\x80\x9d (citation omitted)).  This is enough to rebut the proposition that there is no \xe2\x80\x9csource of [our] authority\xe2\x80\x9d to bind state courts to follow our retroactivity decisions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  Retroactivity is a question of federal law, and our final authority to construe it cannot, at this point in the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, be reasonably doubted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Principles of federalism protect the prerogative of States to extend greater rights under their own laws than are available under federal law.  The question here, however, is the availability of protection under the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x94specifically, the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment.  It is no intrusion on the prerogatives of the States to recognize that it is for this Court to decide such a question of federal law, and that our decision is binding on the States under the Supremacy Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consider the flip side of the question before us today: If a State interprets its own constitution to provide protection beyond that available under the Federal Constitution, and has ruled that this interpretation is not retroactive, no one would suppose that a federal court could hold otherwise, and grant relief under state law that a state court would refuse to grant.  The result should be the same when a state court is asked to give retroactive effect to a right under the Federal Constitution that this Court has held is not retroactive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The distinction between retroactivity and available remedies highlights the fact that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion \xe2\x80\x9cthat <em>Teague</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>general rule of nonretroactivity was an exercise of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s power to interpret the federal habeas statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x94even if correct\xe2\x80\x94is neither here nor there.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  While Congress has substantial control over federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to grant relief for violations of the Federal Constitution, the Constitution gives us the responsibility to decide what its provisions mean.  And with that responsibility necessarily comes the authority to determine the scope of those provisions\xe2\x80\x94when they apply and when they do not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This proposition\xe2\x80\x94and the importance of the distinction between retroactivity and available remedies\xe2\x80\x94were confirmed when we considered the availability of federal collateral review of state convictions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Whatever control Congress has over federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 ability to grant postconviction remedies, the availability or scope of those remedies has no bearing on our decisions about whether new or old law should apply in a particular case.  That is why, after AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s passage, we view the <em>Teague</em> inquiry as distinct from that under AEDPA.  See <em>Horn</em> v. <em>Banks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/266/index.html">536 U. S. 266</a>, 272 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile it is of course a necessary prerequisite to federal habeas relief that a prisoner satisfy the AEDPA standard of review set forth in 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), \xe2\x80\xa6 none of our post-AEDPA cases have suggested that a writ of habeas corpus should automatically issue if a prisoner satisfies the AEDPA standard, or that AEDPA relieves courts from the responsibility of addressing properly raised <em>Teague</em> arguments\xe2\x80\x9d).  The majority today views the issue as simply one of what remedies a State chooses to apply; our cases confirm that the question whether a federal decision is retroactive is one of federal law distinct from the issue of available remedies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lurking behind today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is of course the question of just how free state courts are to define the retroactivity of our decisions interpreting the Federal Constitution.  I do not see any basis in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s logic for concluding that States are free to hold our decisions retroactive when we have held they are not, but not free to hold that they are not when we have held they are.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, in either case the availability of relief in state court is a question for those courts to evaluate independently.  The majority carefully reserves that question, see <em>ante</em>, at 4, n.\xc2\xa04, confirming that the majority regards it as open.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is there anything in today\xe2\x80\x99s decision suggesting that States could not adopt more nuanced approaches to retroactivity.  For example, suppose we hold that the Sixth Amendment right to be represented by particular counsel of choice, recently announced in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/548/140/index.html">548 U. S. 140</a> (2006), is a new rule that does not apply retroactively.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, a state court could decide that it nonetheless will apply <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em> retroactively, but only if the defendant could prove prejudice, or some other criterion we had rejected as irrelevant in defining the substantive right.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s logic, that would not be a misapplication of our decision in <em>Gonzalez-Lopez</em>\xe2\x80\x94which specifically rejected any required showing of prejudice, <em>id.</em>, at 147\xe2\x80\x93148\xe2\x80\x94but simply a state decision on the scope of available remedies in state court.  The possible permutations\xe2\x80\x94from State to State, and federal right to federal right\xe2\x80\x94are endless.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps all this will be dismissed as fine parsing of somewhat arcane precedents, over which reasonable judges may disagree.  Fair enough; but I would hope that enough has been said at least to refute the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that its conclusion is dictated by our prior cases.  This dissent is compelled not simply by disagreement over how to read those cases, but by the fundamental issues at stake\xe2\x80\x94our role under the Constitution as the final arbiter of federal law, both as to its meaning and its reach, and the accompanying duty to ensure the uniformity of that federal law.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Stephen Danforth\xe2\x80\x99s conviction became final before the new rule in <em>Crawford</em> was announced.  In <em>Whorton</em> v. <em>Bockting</em>, 549 U. S. ___ (2007), we held that <em>Crawford </em>shall not be applied retroactively on collateral review.  That should be the end of the matter.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>Payne</em> came to us on direct appeal, but as noted, <em>supra</em>, at 4, we did not at the time distinguish between direct appeal and collateral review for purposes of retroactivity.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court points out that the defendants in such a case are differently situated because they violated the laws of and were tried in different States.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  But disparate treatment under substantively different state laws is something we expect in our federal system; disparate treatment under the same Federal Constitution is quite a different matter.</p>\n<p>\n\nThe majority also points out that the rule announced in <em>Griffith </em>v.<em> Kentucky,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a> (1987)\xe2\x80\x94that full retroactive application ends with the conclusion of direct appeal\xe2\x80\x94creates its own disuniformity, because finality turns on how quickly a State brings its direct appeals to a close.  <em>Ante</em>, at 27.  The same point was raised by the <em>Griffith</em> dissenters, 479 U. S., at 331\xe2\x80\x93332 (opinion of White, J.), and rejected as pertinent by the majority in that case, <em>id.</em>, at 327\xe2\x80\x93328. The disuniformity that the majority emphasizes today and the dissenters emphasized in <em>Griffith</em> is a necessary consequence of our having chosen a relatively clear rule\xe2\x80\x94finality\xe2\x80\x94to delineate the line between full retroactivity and presumptive nonretroactivity.  The relevant point is that whatever inequity arises from the <em>Griffith</em> rule, it is based on a balancing of costs and benefits that <em>this</em> Court\xe2\x80\x94not 50 different sovereigns\xe2\x80\x94has performed.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A federal court applying state law under <em>Erie R. Co.</em> v. <em>Tompkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/304/64/index.html">304 U. S. 64</a> (1938), follows state choice-of-law rules as well, see <em>Klaxon Co.</em> v. <em>Stentor Elec. Mfg. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/313/487/index.html">313 U. S. 487</a>, 496 (1941).  It is not free to follow its own federal rule simply because the issue arises in federal court.  By the same token, a state court considering a federal constitutional claim on collateral review should follow the federal rule on whether new or old law applies.
