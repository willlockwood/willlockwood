The District Court and the appellees see a compelling state interest in the need to preserve the status quo and to preserve political stability. This interest, it is argued, is secured by creating impediments to changes in party allegiance. Our history is replete with instances in which politicians-having become disenchanted with their previous parties or perhaps only for the \'opportunistic\' reasons condemned by the court below- have changed from one party to another. This list includes Teddy Roosevelt, Strom Thurmond, Wayne Morse, John Lindsay, George Wallace, and a host of others. Though these breaks from past political ties add vitality to our political process, Ohio makes it very difficult. </p><p> I would note this appeal and put the case down for early argument.</p><p> Mr. Justice BRENNAN, Mr. Justice WHITE, and Mr. Justice POWELL: </p><p> We are three of the four who dissent from the affirmance of the judgment of the District Court in this case. In the circumstances present here, however, we do not insist that the case be set down for oral argument. </p><p> * In Williams v. Rhodes, supra, at 39-40, 89 S.Ct. at 15, I said. </p><ul>\'Cumbersome election machinery can effectively suffocate the right of association, the promotion of political ideas and programs of political action, and the right to vote. The totality of Ohio\'s requirements has those effects. It is unnecessary to decide whether Ohio has an interest, \'compelling\' or not, in abridging those rights because \'the men who drafted our Bill of Rights did all the \'balancing\' that was to be done in this field.\' Appellees would imply that \'no kind of speech is to be protected if the Government can assert an interest of sufficient weight to induce this Court to uphold its abridgement.\' I reject that suggestion.\' ( Citations omitted.) </ul>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
