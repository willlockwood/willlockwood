It provides, however, that if "any questions of law of <em>such extensive interest and operation</em> as to render the final decision of them by the Supreme Court desirable" are involved in the alleged errors of the circuit court, the case may be heard here even though the matter in dispute is of less value than $1,000; and any judge of the court, if he is of opinion that the questions are of such a character, may allow the writ or appeal accordingly.</p>\n<p>With this statute in force, Campbell by will, left legacies to his widow and several illegitimate children, but, after paying them all, a fund of $141 remained in the hands of the executor undisposed of, there being no residuary legatee named in the will, and no parents &amp;c., legitimate children, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="199">Page 69 U.
