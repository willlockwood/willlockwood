Because this result fails to accord to the state court the deference required by 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d), we grant the petition for certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em> and reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent killed Shipley Todd, 93, and his wife Cleopatra, 79, on August 10, 1980, in their home at the conclusion of a 2-day crime spree.  The killings were accomplished in a brutal and callous fashion: The elderly victims were \xe2\x80\x9crepeatedly beaten about the head until they died,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State </em>v. <em>Cone</em>, 665 S. W. 2d 87, 90\xe2\x80\x9391 (Tenn. 1984), and their bodies were subsequently discovered \xe2\x80\x9chorribly mutilated and cruelly beaten,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 90.  A Tennessee jury convicted respondent of, <em>inter alia</em>, two counts of murder in the first degree and two counts of murder in the first degree in the perpetration of a burglary.  At the conclusion of the penalty phase of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s trial, the jury unanimously found four aggravating circumstances[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and concluded that they outweighed the mitigating evidence.  Respondent was sentenced to death.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Tennessee Supreme Court affirmed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s convictions and sentence.  <em>Id.</em>, at 96.  As relevant here, the court held that three of the aggravating circumstances found by the jury \xe2\x80\x9cwere clearly shown by the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 94.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  With respect to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the murder was \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe jury also found that the murders in question were especially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or depravity of mind as provided in [Tenn. Code Ann.] \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93203(i)(5).  The evidence abundantly established that both of the elderly victims had been brutally beaten to death by multiple crushing blows to the skulls.  Blood was spattered throughout the house, and both victims apparently had attempted to resist, because numerous defensive wounds were found on their persons.  The only excuse offered in the entire record for this unspeakably brutal conduct by the accused was that these elderly victims had at some point ceased to \xe2\x80\x98cooperate\xe2\x80\x99 with him in his ransacking of their home and in his effort to flee from arrest.  As previously stated, it was stipulated by counsel for [respondent] that there was no issue of self-defense even remotely suggested.  The deaths of the victims were not instantaneous, and obviously one had to be killed before the other.  The terror, fright and horror that these elderly helpless citizens must have endured was certainly something that the jury could have taken into account in finding this aggravating circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 94\xe2\x80\x9395.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent twice sought relief from his conviction and sentence in collateral proceedings in state court, to no avail.  In his second amended petition for postconviction relief, respondent raised 52 independent claims of constitutional error, including a contention that the \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance was unconstitutionally vague under the Eighth Amendment.  The state trial court held each of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claims barred by Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa740\xe2\x80\x9330\xe2\x80\x93111 (Lexis 1990), which limited the grounds that may be raised on collateral review to those not waived or previously determined in previous proceedings.  The trial court explained that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional challenge to the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance, along with many other claims, was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly [a] re-statemen[t] of previous grounds heretofore determined and denied by the Tennessee Supreme Court upon Direct Appeal or the Court of Criminal Appeals upon the First Petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cone </em>v. <em>State</em>, No. P\xe2\x80\x9306874 (Tenn. Crim. Ct., Dec. 16, 1993), p. 6.  The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the denial of relief on all grounds.  <em>Cone </em>v. <em>State</em>, 927 S. W. 2d 579, 582 (1995).  The State Supreme Court denied respondent permission to appeal.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1997, respondent sought a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee, again asserting a multitude of claims.  The District Court denied relief; it held respondent\xe2\x80\x99s vagueness challenge to the \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance to be procedurally barred by respondent\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise it on direct appeal in state court.  The Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit subsequently held that respondent was entitled to relief on another ground and did not consider respondent\xe2\x80\x99s challenges to the aggravating circumstances found by the jury.<font b="1"> <em>Cone </em>v. <em>Bell</em>, 243 F.\xc2\xa03d 961, 975 (2001).

The court first rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that respondent procedurally defaulted the claim in state court.  Based on its understanding of state law, the court concluded that the State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s statutorily mandated review of each death sentence, see Tenn. Code Ann. \xc2\xa739\xe2\x80\x932\xe2\x80\x93205(c)(1) (Lexis 1982), necessarily included the consideration of constitutional deficiencies in the aggravating circumstances found by the jury and therefore that the issue was \xe2\x80\x9cfairly presented\xe2\x80\x9d to the state court, even if respondent did not raise it himself.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  359 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 791\xe2\x80\x93793.  Judge Norris dissented on this point.  <em>Id.</em>, at 806.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning to the merits, the Sixth Circuit held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d the clearly established principles set forth in our decision in <em>Godfrey </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/420/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/420/index.html">446 U.

The Court of Appeals allowed that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o Supreme Court case has addressed the precise language at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d 359 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 795, and that no \xe2\x80\x9cSupreme Court decision is \xe2\x80\x98on all fours\xe2\x80\x99 with the instruction in Cone\xe2\x80\x99s case,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] <em>id.</em>, at 796, but nevertheless concluded, in light of <em>Godfrey</em> and the series of cases that followed it, <em>Maynard </em>v. <em>Cartwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/356/index.html">486 U.

Lastly, the court rejected petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any deficiency in the aggravating circumstance on direct appeal by reviewing the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding under the narrowed construction of the aggravator that it adopted in <em>State </em>v. <em>Dicks</em>, 615 S.

If so, then the federal court must attempt to determine whether the state courts have further defined the vague terms and, if they have done so, whether those definitions are constitutionally sufficient, <em>i.e.</em>, whether they provide <em>some</em> guidance to the sentencer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Walton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 654.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThese principles were plain enough at the time the State Supreme Court decided respondent\xe2\x80\x99s appeal.  In <em>Proffitt </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/242/index.html">428 U. S. 242</a> (1976), we upheld the aggravating circumstance that the murder was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98especially heinous, atrocious or cruel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the express ground that a narrowing construction had been adopted by that State\xe2\x80\x99s Supreme Court.  <em>Id.</em>, at 255 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  And, in <em>Gregg </em>v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U. S. 153</a> (1976), we refused to invalidate the aggravating circumstance that the murder was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98outrageously or wantonly vile, horrible or inhuman in that it involved torture, depravity of mind, or an aggravated battery to the victim,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthere [was] no reason to assume that the Supreme Court of Georgia will adopt . . . an open-ended construction\xe2\x80\x9d that is potentially applicable to any murder.  <em>Id.</em>, at 201 (joint opinion of Stewart, Powell, and Stevens, JJ.).  See generally <em>Lewis </em>v. <em>Jeffers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/764/index.html">497 U.

S. 420</a>, the case on which the Court of Appeals relied in declaring the aggravating circumstance to be unconstitutionally vague, the controlling plurality opinion followed precisely this procedure.  Like the court below, the plurality looked first to the language of the aggravating circumstance found by the jury and concluded that there \xe2\x80\x9cwas nothing in these few words, standing alone, that implies any inherent restraint on the arbitrary and capricious infliction of the death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 428.  But the plurality did not stop there: It next evaluated whether the Georgia Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9capplied a constitutional construction\xe2\x80\x9d of the aggravating circumstance on appeal.  <em>Id</em>., at 432.  Because the facts of the case did not resemble those in which the state court had previously applied a narrower construction of the aggravating circumstance and because the state court gave no explanation for its decision other than to say that the verdict was \xe2\x80\x9cfactually substantiated,\xe2\x80\x9d the plurality concluded that it did not.  <em>Id.</em>, at 432\xe2\x80\x93433.  As we have subsequently explained, this conclusion was the linchpin of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding: \xe2\x80\x9cHad the Georgia Supreme Court applied a narrowing construction of the aggravator, we would have rejected the Eighth Amendment challenge to Godfrey\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, notwithstanding the failure to instruct the jury on that narrowing construction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lambrix </em>v. <em>Singletary</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/518/index.html">520 U. S. 518</a>, 531 (1997).  See also <em>Walton</em>, 497 U. S., at 653\xe2\x80\x93654; <em>Cartwright</em>, 486 U. S., at 363\xe2\x80\x93365 (refusing to countenance the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 affirmance of a death sentence based on a facially vague aggravating circumstance where that court had not adopted a narrowing construction of its aggravator when it affirmed the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s sentence).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, however, the Sixth Circuit rejected the possibility that the Tennessee Supreme Court cured any error in the jury instruction by applying a narrowing construction of the statutory \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravator.  The court asserted that the State Supreme Court \xe2\x80\x9cdid not apply, or even mention, any narrowing interpretation or cite to [<em>sic</em>] <em>Dicks</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the case in which the State Supreme Court had adopted a narrowing construction of the aggravating circumstance.  359 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797.  \xe2\x80\x9cInstead,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, \xe2\x80\x9cthe [state] court simply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels \xe2\x80\x98heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\xe2\x80\x99 without more, applied to [respondent\xe2\x80\x99s] crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not think that a federal court can presume so lightly that a state court failed to apply its own law.  As we have said before, \xc2\xa72254(d) dictates a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98highly deferential standard for evaluating state-court rulings,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Lindh </em>v. <em>Murphy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/320/index.html">521 U. S. 320</a>, 333 n.\xc2\xa07 (1997), which demands that state-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Woodford </em>v. <em>Viscotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U. S. 19</a>, 24 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  To the extent that the Court of Appeals rested its decision on the state court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to cite <em>Dicks</em>, it was mistaken.  Federal courts are not free to presume that a state court did not comply with constitutional dictates on the basis of nothing more than a lack of citation.  See <em>Mitchell </em>v. <em>Esparza</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/12/index.html">540 U. S. 12</a>, 16 (2003) <em>(per curiam); Early </em>v. <em>Packer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/3/index.html">537 U. S. 3</a>, 8 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More importantly, however, we find no basis for the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 statement that the state court \xe2\x80\x9csimply, but explicitly, satisfied itself that the labels \xe2\x80\x98heinous, atrocious, or cruel,\xe2\x80\x99 without more, applied\xe2\x80\x9d to the murder.  359 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 797.  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not disclaim application of that court\xe2\x80\x99s established construction of the aggravating circumstance; the only thing that it states \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly\xe2\x80\x9d is that the evidence in this case supported the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding of the statutory aggravator.  See <em>Cone</em>, 665 S. W. 2d, at 95<em> </em>(stating that the aggravating circumstance was \xe2\x80\x9cindisputably established by the record\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we explain below, the State Supreme Court had construed the aggravating circumstance narrowly and had followed that precedent numerous times; absent an affirmative indication to the contrary, we must presume that it did the same thing here.  See <em>Viscotti</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 24 (stating the presumption that state courts \xe2\x80\x9cknow and follow the law\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Lambrix</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 532, n.\xc2\xa04; <em>Walton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 653.  That is especially true in a case such as this one, where the state court has recognized that its narrowing construction is constitutionally compelled and has affirmatively assumed the responsibility to ensure that the aggravating circumstance is applied constitutionally in each case.  See <em>State </em>v. <em>Pritchett</em>, 621 S. W. 2d 127, 139, 140 (Tenn. 1981).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even absent such a presumption in the state court\xe2\x80\x99s favor, however, we would still conclude in this case that the state court applied the narrower construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance.  The State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in this case closely tracked its rationale for affirming the death sentences in other cases in which it expressly applied a narrowed construction of the same \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravator.  Accord,<em> Godfrey</em>, 446 U. S., at 432 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances of this case \xe2\x80\xa6 do not satisfy the criteria [for torture] laid out by the Georgia Supreme Court itself\xe2\x80\x9d in its cases construing the aggravating circumstance).  The facts the court relied on to affirm the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict\xe2\x80\x94that the elderly victims attempted to resist, that their deaths were not instantaneous, that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s actions towards them were \xe2\x80\x9cunspeakably brutal\xe2\x80\x9d and that they endured \xe2\x80\x9cterror, fright and horror\xe2\x80\x9d before being killed, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 95\xe2\x80\x94match, almost exactly, the reasons the state court gave when it held the evidence in <em>State </em>v. <em>Melson</em>, 638 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 342, 367 (1982), to be sufficient to satisfy the torture prong of the narrowed \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance.  See also<em> Pritchett</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 139 (finding the evidence to be insufficient to satisfy a narrowed construction of the aggravator where the victim\xe2\x80\x99s death was \xe2\x80\x9cinstantaneous\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> State </em>v. <em>Campbell</em>, 664 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 281, 284 (Tenn. 1984) (holding that evidence of the aggravator was \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming\xe2\x80\x9d where an elderly murder victim was beaten to death with a blunt object and his hands showed that he had attempted to defend himself).  Similarly, the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s victims had been \xe2\x80\x9cbrutally beaten to death by multiple crushing blows to the skulls,\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]lood was spattered throughout the house,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the victims were helpless, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 94\xe2\x80\x9395, accord with the reasons that the state court had previously found sufficient to support findings of depravity of mind.  See <em>Melson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 367; <em>State </em>v. <em>Groseclose</em>, 615 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 142, 151 (Tenn. 1981); <em>Strouth </em>v. <em>State</em>, 999 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 759, 766 (Tenn. 1999).  In sum, a review of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s previous decisions interpreting and applying the narrowed construction of the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravator leaves little doubt that the State Supreme Court applied that same construction in respondent\xe2\x80\x99s case.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only remaining question is whether the narrowing construction that the Tennessee Supreme Court applied was itself unconstitutionally vague.  See <em>Walton</em>, 497 U. S., at 654; <em>Godfrey</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 428.  It was not.  In <em>State </em>v. <em>Dicks</em>, 615 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 126 (Tenn. 1981), the state court adopted the exact construction of the aggravator that we approved in <em>Proffitt</em>, 428 U. S., at 255: that the aggravator was \xe2\x80\x9cdirected at \xe2\x80\x98the conscienceless or pitiless crime which is unnecessarily torturous to the victim,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Dicks</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 132.  See also <em>Sochor </em>v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/527/index.html">504 U. S. 527</a>, 536 (1992).  In light of <em>Proffitt</em>,<em> </em>we think this interpretation of the aggravator, standing alone, would be sufficient to overcome the claim that the aggravating circumstance applied by the state court was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to\xe2\x80\x9d clearly established federal law under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s subsequent application of this aggravating circumstance, as construed in <em>Dicks</em>, stands as further proof that it could be applied meaningfully to narrow the class of death-eligible offenders.   Later in the year that <em>Dicks </em>was decided, the court elaborated on the meaning of the aggravator:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the Tennessee aggravating circumstances [<em>sic</em>] [that the murder was heinous, atrocious, or cruel], does not contain the phrase, \xe2\x80\x98an aggravated battery to the victim\xe2\x80\x99 it is clear that a constitutional construction of this aggravating circumstance requires evidence that the defendant inflicted torture on the victim before death or that [the] defendant committed acts evincing a depraved state of mind; that the depraved state of mind or the torture inflicted must meet the test of heinous, atrocious, or cruel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pritchett</em>, 621 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 139 (citation omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWith respect to the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ctorture,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held that the aggravator was not satisfied where the victim dies instantly, <em>ibid.</em>, but that it was where \xe2\x80\x9cthe uncontradicted proof shows that [the victim] had defensive injuries to her arms and hands, proving that there was time for her to realize what was happening, to feel fear, and to try to protect herself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Melson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 367.  Accord, <em>Cartwright</em>, 486 U. S., at 364\xe2\x80\x93365 (approving the limitation of the \xe2\x80\x9cheinous, atrocious, or cruel\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating circumstance to killings in which the victim suffered \xe2\x80\x9csome kind of torture or serious physical abuse\xe2\x80\x9d prior to the murder).  As to \xe2\x80\x9cdepravity of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d the court held the fact that the defendant fired a second shotgun blast into a victim after he was dead to be insufficient as a matter of law, see <em>Pritchett</em>, 621 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 139 (explaining that the depravity in such an action falls short of that exhibited by the defendant in <em>Godfrey</em>, <em>supra</em>), but concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9ca killing wherein the victim is struck up to thirty times, causing an entire room to be covered with a spray of flying blood, and causing the victim\xe2\x80\x99s brains to extrude through the gaping hole in her skull,\xe2\x80\x9d sufficed, <em>Melson</em>, 638 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d, at 367.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In light of these holdings, we are satisfied that the State\xe2\x80\x99s aggravating circumstance, as construed by the Tennessee Supreme Court, ensured that there was a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipled basis\xe2\x80\x9d for distinguishing between those cases in which the death penalty was assessed and those cases in which it was not.  <em>Arave </em>v. <em>Creech</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/463/index.html">507 U. S. 463</a>, 474 (1993).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, even assuming that the Court of Appeals was correct to conclude that the State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory aggravating circumstance was facially vague, the court erred in presuming that the State Supreme Court failed to cure this vagueness by applying a narrowing construction on direct appeal.  The state court did apply such a narrowing construction, and that construction satisfied constitutional demands by ensuring that respondent was not sentenced to death in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  See <em>Godfrey</em>, 446 U. S., at 428.  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmance of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s sentence on this ground was therefore not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to \xe2\x80\xa6 clearly established Federal law,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), and the Court of Appeals was without power to issue a writ of habeas corpus.  We reverse the judgment of the Sixth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The jury found the following aggravating circumstances: (1) respondent had been convicted of one or more felonies involving the use or threat of violence to a person, (2) the murders were \xe2\x80\x9cespecially heinous, atrocious, or cruel in that they involved torture or depravity of mind,\xe2\x80\x9d (3) respondent committed the murders for the purpose of preventing a lawful arrest or prosecution, and (4) respondent knowingly created a risk of death to two or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during the murder.  See <em>State </em>v. <em>Cone</em>, 665 S.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 87, 94\xe2\x80\x9395 (Tenn. 1984).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The state court rejected the jury\xe2\x80\x99s finding that respondent \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98knowingly created a risk of death to two (2) or more persons, other than the victim murdered, during his act of murder,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the ground that the considerable threat respondent posed to others earlier in the day was not sufficiently close in time to the murders.  Based on the strength of the other aggravating circumstances before the jury, the court held this error to be \xe2\x80\x9charmless beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 95.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion in this regard is in tension with the decisions of other Courts of Appeals, which have held that a petitioner must raise his constitutional claim in state court in order to preserve it, notwithstanding the existence of a mandatory-review statute.  See <em>Mu\xe2\x80\x99min </em>v. <em>Pruett</em>, 125 F.\xc2\xa03d 192, 197 (CA4 1997) (Virginia); <em>Martinez-Villareal </em>v. <em>Lewis</em>, 80 F.\xc2\xa03d 1301, 1306 (CA9 1996) (Arizona); <em>Kornahrens </em>v. <em>Evatt</em>, 66 F.\xc2\xa03d 1350, 1362 (CA4 1995) (South Carolina); <em>Nave </em>v. <em>Delo</em>, 62 F.\xc2\xa03d 1024, 1039 (CA8 1995) (Missouri); <em>Julius </em>v. <em>Johnson</em>, 840 F.\xc2\xa02d 1533, 1546 (CA11 1988) (Alabama).  We find it unnecessary to express a view on this point.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(b)(2) (an application for habeas corpus may be denied on the merits, notwithstanding a petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to exhaust in state court).  We do emphasize that, as a general matter, the burden is on the petitioner to raise his federal claim in the state courts at a time when state procedural law permits its consideration on the merits, even if the state court could have identified and addressed the federal question without its having been raised.

See 359 F.\xc2\xa03d 785, 791\xe2\x80\x93794 (2004); see also <em>ante</em>, at 4.  This Court indulges the same assumption.  See <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9311, 13.

This Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, it bears emphasis, does not grapple with the following scenario: A state prisoner petitions for federal habeas review after exhausting his state remedies.  In the anterior state proceeding, the prisoner raised multiple issues.  The state court, in disposing of the case, left one or more of the issues unaddressed.  There would be no warrant, in such a case, for an assumption that the state court, <em>sub silentio</em>, considered the issue and resolved it on the merits in accord with the State\xe2\x80\x99s relevant law.  Nothing in the record would discount the possibility that the issue was simply overlooked.  A federal court would act arbitrarily if it assumed that an issue raised in state court was necessarily decided there, despite the absence of any indication that the state court itself adverted to the point.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
