S. 207</a></p><p> appeals. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The question arises from the following circumstances.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, a native and citizen of China, evidently entered the United States in 1965 as a seaman. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The terms of his entry permitted him to remain in this country for the period during which his vessel was in port, provided that this did not exceed 29 days.   <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1282(a). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  He deserted his vessel, and remained unlawfully in the United States.  After petitioner\'s eventual apprehension, deportation proceedings were conducted by a special inquiry officer under the authority of \xc2\xa7 242(b).  Petitioner conceded his deportability, but sought and obtained permission to depart the United States voluntarily. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Despite his protestations of good faith, petitioner did not voluntarily depart, and was ultimately ordered to surrender for deportation.  He then requested a stay of deportation from a district director of immigration, pending the submission and disposition of an application for adjustment of status under 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1153(a)(7) (1964 ed., Supp. II). [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The district director </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 392 U. S. 208</a></p><p> concluded that petitioner is ineligible for such an adjustment of status, and denied a stay of deportation.</p>\n<p>Petitioner thereupon commenced these proceedings in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, petitioning for review of the denial of a stay.  The Court of Appeals held that the provisions of \xc2\xa7 106(a), under which it would otherwise have exclusive jurisdiction to review the district director\'s order, are inapplicable to orders denying ancillary relief unless those orders either are entered in the course of a proceeding conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), or are denials of motions to reopen such proceedings.  The court dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction.  381 F.2d 542.  We granted certiorari because the courts of appeals have disagreed as to the proper construction of the pertinent statutory provisions. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  390 U.S. 918.  For reasons that follow, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>It is useful first to summarize the relevant provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act and of the regulations promulgated under the Act\'s authority.  Section </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 392 U. S. 209</a></p><p> 242(b) provides a detailed administrative procedure for determining whether an alien may be deported.  It permits the entry of an order of deportation only upon the basis of a record made in a proceeding before a special inquiry officer, at which the alien is assured rights to counsel, to a reasonable opportunity to examine the evidence against him, to cross-examine witnesses, and to present evidence in his own behalf.  By regulation, various forms of discretionary relief may also be sought from the special inquiry officer in the course of the deportation proceeding; an alien may, for example, request that his deportation be temporarily withheld, on the ground that he might, in the country to which he is to be deported, "be subject to persecution. . . ."  <em>See</em> 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1253(h) (1964 ed., Supp. II); 8 CFR \xc2\xa7 242.8(a).</p>\n<p>Other forms of discretionary relief may be requested after termination of the deportation proceeding.  The regulations thus provide that an alien "under a final administrative order of deportation" may apply to the district director "having jurisdiction over the place where the alien is at the time of filing" for a stay of deportation.  8 CFR \xc2\xa7 243.4.  The stay may be granted by the district director "in his discretion."  <em>Ibid.</em>  If the stay is denied, the denial "is not appealable" to the Board of Immigration Appeals.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Section 106(a) [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] provides that the procedures for judicial review prescribed by the Hobbs Act, 64 Stat. 1129, 68 Stat. 961,</p>\n<p>"shall apply to, and shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for, the judicial review of all final orders of deportation heretofore or hereafter made against aliens . . . pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b) of this Act. . . ."</p>\n<p>These procedures </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 392 U. S. 210</a></p><p> vest in the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction to review final orders issued by specified federal agencies.  In situations to which the provisions of \xc2\xa7 106(a) are inapplicable, the alien\'s remedies would, of course, ordinarily lie first in an action brought in an appropriate district court.</p>\n<p>The positions of the various parties may be summarized as follows.  We are urged by both petitioner and the Immigration Service to hold that the provisions of \xc2\xa7 106(a) are applicable to the circumstances presented by this case, and that judicial review thus is available only in the courts of appeals.  The Immigration Service contends that \xc2\xa7 106(a) should be understood to embrace all determinations "directly affecting the execution of the basic deportation order," whether those determinations have been reached prior to, during, or subsequent to the deportation proceeding. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  In contrast, <em>amicus</em> [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] urges, as the Court of Appeals held, that \xc2\xa7 106(a) encompasses only those orders made in the course of a proceeding conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b) or issued upon motions to reopen such proceedings.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>This is the third case in which we have had occasion to examine the effect of \xc2\xa7 106(a).  In the first, <em>Foti v. Immigration Service,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html">375 U. S. 217</a></span>, the petitioner, in the course of a proceeding conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), conceded his deportability but requested a suspension of deportation under \xc2\xa7 244(a)(5).  The special inquiry officer denied such a suspension, and petitioner\'s appeal from the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 392 U. S. 211</a></p><p> denial was dismissed by the Board of Immigration Appeals.  Petitioner commenced an action in the district court, but the action was dismissed on the ground that, under \xc2\xa7 106(a), his exclusive remedy lay in the courts of appeals.  He then petitioned for review to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, but it dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  A divided court held en banc that the procedures of \xc2\xa7 106(a) were inapplicable to denials of discretionary relief under \xc2\xa7 244(a)(6).  308 F.2d 779.  On certiorari, we reversed, holding that</p>\n<p>"all determinations made during and incident to the administrative proceeding conducted by a special inquiry officer, and reviewable together by the Board of Immigration Appeals . . . are . . . included within the ambit of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of Appeals under \xc2\xa7 106(a)."</p>\n<p>375 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#229">375 U. S. 229</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the second case, <em>Giova v. Rosenberg,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/18/case.html">379 U. S. 18</a></span>, petitioner moved before the Board of Immigration Appeals to reopen proceedings, previously conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), that had terminated in an order for his deportation.  The Board denied relief.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit concluded that the Board\'s denial was not embraced by \xc2\xa7 106(a), and dismissed the petition for want of jurisdiction.  308 F.2d 347.  On certiorari, this Court held, in a brief per curiam opinion, that such orders were within the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of appeals.</p>\n<p>Although <em>Foti</em> strongly suggests the result that we reach today, neither it nor <em>Giova</em> can properly be regarded as controlling in this situation.  Unlike the order in <em>Foti,</em> the order in this case was not entered in the course of a proceeding conducted by a special inquiry officer under \xc2\xa7 242(b); unlike the order in <em>Giova,</em> the order here did not deny a motion to reopen such a proceeding.  We regard the issue of statutory construction involved here as markedly closer than the questions presented </p><p><a class="page-number" name="212">Page 392 U. S. 212</a></p><p> in those cases; at the least, it is plainly an issue upon which differing views may readily be entertained.  In these circumstances, it is imperative, if we are accurately to implement Congress\' purposes, to "seiz[e] everything from which aid can be derived."  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/358/case.html">Fisher v. Blight,</a></span></em> 2 Cranch 358,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/6/358/case.html#386">6 U. S. 386</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is important, first, to emphasize the character of the statute with which we are concerned.  Section 106(a) is intended exclusively to prescribe and regulate a portion of the jurisdiction of the federal courts.  As a jurisdictional statute, it must be construed both with precision and with fidelity to the terms by which Congress has expressed its wishes.  <em>Utah Junk Co. v. Porter,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/39/case.html">328 U. S. 39</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/328/39/case.html#44">328 U. S. 44</a></span>.  Further, as a statute addressed entirely to "specialists," it must, as Mr. Justice Frankfurter observed, "be read by judges with the minds of . . . specialists." [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>We cannot, upon close reading, easily reconcile the position urged by the Immigration Service with the terms of \xc2\xa7 106(a).  A denial by a district director of a stay of deportation is not literally a "final order of deportation," nor is it, as was the order in <em>Foti,</em> entered in the course of administrative proceedings conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, the order in this case was issued more </p><p><a class="page-number" name="213">Page 392 U. S. 213</a></p><p> than three months after the entry of the final order of deportation, [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] in proceedings entirely distinct from those conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), by an officer other than the special inquiry officer who, as required by \xc2\xa7 242(b), presided over the deportation proceeding.  The order here did not involve the denial of a motion to reopen proceedings conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), or to reconsider any final order of deportation.  Concededly, the application for a stay assumed the prior existence of an order of deportation, but petitioner did not "attack the deportation order itself, but instead [sought] relief not inconsistent with it."  <em>Mui v. Esperdy,</em> 371 F.2d 772, 777.  If, as the Immigration Service urges, \xc2\xa7 106(a) embraces all determinations "directly affecting the execution of" a final deportation order, Congress has selected language remarkably inapposite for its purpose.  As Judge Friendly observed in a similar case, if "Congress had </p><p><a class="page-number" name="214">Page 392 U. S. 214</a></p><p> wanted to go that far, presumably it would have known how to say so."  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The legislative history of \xc2\xa7 106(a) does not strengthen the position of the Immigration Service.  The "basic purpose" of the procedural portions of the 1961 legislation was, as we stated in <em>Foti,</em> evidently "to expedite the deportation of undesirable aliens by preventing successive dilatory appeals to various federal courts. . . ."  375 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#226">375 U. S. 226</a></span>.  Congress prescribed for this purpose several procedural innovations, among them the device of direct petitions for review to the courts of appeals.  Although, as the Immigration Service has emphasized, the broad purposes of the legislation might have been expected to encompass orders denying discretionary relief entered outside \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceedings, there is evidence that Congress deliberately restricted the application of \xc2\xa7 106(a) to orders made in the course of proceedings conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b).</p>\n<p>Thus, during a colloquy on the floor of the House of Representatives, to which we referred in <em>Foti,</em> [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] Representative Moore, co-sponsor of the bill then under discussion, suggested that any difficulties resulting from the separate consideration of deportability and of discretionary relief could be overcome by</p>\n<p>"a change in the present administrative practice of considering the issues . . . piecemeal.  There is no reason why the Immigration Service could not change its regulations to permit contemporaneous court consideration of deportability and administrative application for relief."</p>\n<p>105 Cong.Rec. 12728.  In the same colloquy, Representative Walter, the chairman of the subcommittee that conducted the pertinent hearings, recognized that certain forms of discretionary relief may be requested in the course of a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="215">Page 392 U. S. 215</a></p><p> deportation proceeding, and stated that \xc2\xa7 106(a) would apply to the disposition of such requests, "just as it would apply to any other issue <em>brought up in deportation proceedings.</em>"  105 Cong.Rec. 12728 (emphasis added).  Similarly, Representative Walter, in a subsequent debate, responded to a charge that judicial review under \xc2\xa7 106(a) would prove inadequate because of the absence of a suitable record, by inviting "the gentleman\'s attention to the law in section 242, in which the procedure for the examiner is set forth in detail."  107 Cong.Rec. 12179.</p>\n<p>We believe that, in combination with the terms of \xc2\xa7 106(a) itself, these statements lead to the inference that Congress quite deliberately restricted the application of \xc2\xa7 106(a) to orders entered during proceedings conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), or directly challenging deportation orders themselves. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  This is concededly "a choice between uncertainties," but we are "content to choose the lesser."  <em>Burnet v. Guggenheim,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/280/case.html">288 U. S. 280</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/288/280/case.html#288">288 U. S. 288</a></span>.</p>\n<p>We need not speculate as to Congress\' purposes.  Quite possibly, as Judge Browning has persuasively suggested,</p>\n<p>"Congress visualized a single administrative proceeding in which all questions relating to an alien\'s deportation would be raised and resolved, followed by a single petition in a court of appeals for judicial review. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Yamada v. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Service,</em> 384 F.2d 214, 218.  It may therefore be that Congress expected the Immigration Service to include within the  242(b) proceeding "all issues which might affect deportation."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Possibly, as <em>amicus</em> cogently urges, Congress wished to limit petitions to the courts of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="216">Page 392 U. S. 216</a></p><p> appeals to situations in which <em>quasi</em>-judicial hearings had been conducted. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  It is enough to emphasize that neither of these purposes would be in any fashion impeded by the result we reach today.  We hold that the judicial review provisions of \xc2\xa7 106(a) embrace only those determinations made during a proceeding conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b), including those determinations made incident to a motion to reopen such proceedings. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>This result is entirely consistent with our opinion in <em>Foti.</em>  There, it was repeatedly stated in the opinion of THE CHIEF JUSTICE that the order held reviewable under \xc2\xa7 106(a) had, as the regulations required, been entered in the course of a proceeding conducted under \xc2\xa7 242(b).  375 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#218">375 U. S. 218</a></span>, 222-223,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#224">375 U.

It was emphasized that "the administrative discretion to grant a suspension of deportation," the determination involved in <em>Foti,</em> "has historically been consistently exercised as an integral part of the proceedings which have led to the issuance of a final deportation order."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#223">375 U. S. 223</a></span>.  A suspension of deportation "must be requested prior to or during the deportation hearing."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Moreover, it was explicitly recognized that, although modification of the pertinent regulations might "effectively broaden or narrow the scope of review available in the Courts of Appeals," this was "nothing anomalous." [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="217">Page 392 U. S. 217</a></p><p> <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#229">375 U. S. 229</a></span>-230.  An essential premise of <em>Foti</em> was thus that the application of \xc2\xa7 106(a) had been limited to orders "made during the same proceedings in which deportability is determined. . . ."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#224">375 U. S. 224</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The per curiam opinion in <em>Giova</em> did not take a wider view of \xc2\xa7 106(a).  The denial of an application to reopen a deportation proceeding is readily distinguishable from a denial of a stay of deportation, in which there is no attack upon the deportation order or upon the proceeding in which it was entered.  Petitions to reopen, like motions for rehearing or reconsideration, are, as the Immigration Service urged in <em>Foti,</em> "intimately and immediately associated" with the final orders they seek to challenge. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Thus, petitions to reopen deportation proceedings are governed by the regulations applicable to the deportation proceeding itself, and, indeed, are ordinarily presented for disposition to the special inquiry officer who entered the deportation order. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The result in <em>Giova</em> was thus a logical concomitant of the construction of 106(a) reached in <em>Foti;</em> it did not, explicitly or by implication, broaden that construction in any fashion that encompasses this situation.</p>\n<p>The result we reach today will doubtless mean that, on occasion, the review of denials of discretionary relief will be conducted separately from the review of an order of deportation involving the same alien.  Nonetheless, this does not seem an onerous burden, nor is it one that cannot be avoided, at least in large part, by appropriate action of the Immigration Service itself.  More important, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 392 U. S. 218</a></p><p> although "there is no table of logarithms for statutory construction," [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>] it is the result that we believe most consistent both with Congress\' intentions and with the terms by which it has chosen to express those intentions.</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>We emphasize that no questions are presented as to petitioner\'s deportability or as to the propriety in his situation of any discretionary relief.  We intimate no views on any such questions.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The facts concerning petitioner\'s entry into, and subsequent stay in, the United States appear to have been conceded in the proceeding before the special inquiry officer.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Section 1282(a) provides in relevant part that</p>\n<p>"(a) No alien crewman shall be permitted to land temporarily in the United States except . . . for a period of time, in any event, not to exceed -- (1) the period of time (not exceeding twenty-nine days) during which the vessel . . . remains in port. . . ."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>We note, as we did in <em>Foti v.

First, \xc2\xa7 106(a) was evidently limited to those final orders of deportation made "pursuant to administrative proceedings under section 242(b)" simply because Congress preferred to exclude from it those deportation orders entered without a \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceeding.  This would, for example, place orders issued under 8 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1282(b), by which the Immigration Service may revoke a seaman\'s conditional permit to land and deport him, outside the judicial review procedures of \xc2\xa7 106(a).  <em>See generally</em> C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \xc2\xa7 5.11 (1967).  Perhaps this suggests, as <em>amicus</em> urges, that \xc2\xa7 106(a) was intended to be limited to situations in which <em>quasi</em>-judicial proceedings, such as those under \xc2\xa7 242(b), have been conducted.  It certainly indicates that the reference in \xc2\xa7 106(a) to \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceedings was intended to limit, and not to broaden, the classes of orders to which \xc2\xa7 106(a) may be applied.  Second, it must be reiterated that \xc2\xa7 106(a) does not, as the dissenting opinion suggests, encompass "all orders" entered pursuant to \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceedings; it is limited to "final orders of deportation."  The textual difficulty, with which the dissenting opinion does not deal, is that the order in question here neither is a final order of deportation, nor is it, as was the order in <em>Foti,</em> "made during the same proceedings" in which a final order of deportation has been issued.  375 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/375/217/case.html#224">375 U.

JUSTICE WHITE, dissenting.</p>\n<p>If the special inquiry officer had possessed jurisdiction to issue a stay order pending petitioner\'s efforts to obtain discretionary relief from the District Director, I take it that his denial of the stay, like a refusal to reopen, would have been appealable to the Court of Appeals.  But, as I understand it, no stay could have been granted by the hearing officer, and it was sought from the District Director as an immediate consequence of there being outstanding a final order of deportation which, if executed, might moot the underlying request for relief from the District Director.  Section 106 does not limit judicial review in the Court of Appeals to orders entered "in the course of" \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceedings, but extends it to all orders against aliens entered "pursuant" to such proceedings, that is, at least as Webster would have it, <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/206/case.html">*</a></span> "acting or done in consequence" of the \xc2\xa7 242(b) proceedings.  Except for the order of deportation, there would have been no occasion or need to seek a stay.  It hardly strains congressional intention to give the word "pursuant" its ordinary meaning in the English language.  If there are reasons based on policy for the Court\'s contrary conclusion, they are not stated.  I would reverse the judgment.</p>\n<p>* Merriam-Webster, Webster\'s New International Dictionary, Second Edition, unabridged (1957), defines "pursuant" as:</p>\n<p>"1.  Acting or done in consequence or in prosecution (of anything); hence, agreeable; conformable; following; according. . . ."</p>\n<p>"2. That is in pursuit or pursuing. . . ."</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
