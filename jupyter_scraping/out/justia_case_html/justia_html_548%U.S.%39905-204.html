Although the Democratic Party then controlled 19 of those 27 seats, as well as both state legislative houses and the governorship, change was in the air: The Republican Party had received 47% of the 1990 statewide vote, while the Democrats had received only 51%.  Faced with a possible Republican ascent to majority status, the legislature drew a congressional redistricting plan that favored Democratic candidates.  The Republicans challenged the 1991 Plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 2000 census authorized two additional seats for the Texas delegation.  The Republicans then controlled the governorship and the State Senate, but did not yet control the State House of Representatives.  So constituted, the legislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in litigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with the U. S. Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s one-person, one-vote requirement.  Conscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional districts lies with the political branches of government, and hesitant to undo the work of one political party for the benefit of another, the three-judge Federal District Court sought to apply only \xe2\x80\x9cneutral\xe2\x80\x9d redistricting standards when drawing Plan 1151C, including placing the two new seats in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct lines, and avoiding the pairing of incumbents.  Under Plan 1151C, the 2002 congressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in votes for statewide office in 2000, thus leaving the 1991 Democratic gerrymander largely in place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, however, Texas Republicans gained control of both houses of the legislature and set out to increase Republican representation in the congressional delegation.  After a protracted partisan struggle, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map, Plan 1374C.  In the 2004 congressional elections, Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide races against the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 41%.  Soon after Plan 1374C was enacted, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of constitutional and statutory violations.  In 2004 the District Court entered judgment for appellees, but this Court vacated the decision and remanded for consideration in light of <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html">541 U.

That disagreement persists.  The <em>Vieth</em> plurality would have held such challenges nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority declined to do so, see 541 U. S., at 306, 317, 343, 355.  Justiciability is not revisited here.  At issue is whether appellants offer a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for determining whether a partisan gerrymander is unconstitutional.

The District 23 changes required adjustments elsewhere, so the State created new District 25 to avoid retrogression under \xc2\xa75 of the Act.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b).  <em>Thornburg</em> v. <em>Gingles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/30/index.html">478 U. S. 30</a>, 50\xe2\x80\x9351, identified three threshold conditions for establishing a \xc2\xa72 violation: (1) the racial group must be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) the group must be \xe2\x80\x9cpolitically cohesive\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) the white majority must \xe2\x80\x9cvot[e] sufficiently as a bloc to enable it \xe2\x80\xa6 usually to defeat the minority\xe2\x80\x99s preferred candidate.\xe2\x80\x9d  The legislative history identifies factors that courts can use, once all three threshold requirements are met, in interpreting \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctotality of circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d standard, including the State\xe2\x80\x99s history of voting-related discrimination, the extent to which voting is racially polarized, and the extent to which the State has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group.  See <em>id., </em>at 44\xe2\x80\x9345.  Another relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.  <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>De Grandy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/997/index.html">512 U. S. 997</a>, 1000.  The district court\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether the \xc2\xa72 requirements are satisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.  See <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 78\xe2\x80\x9379.  Where \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate finding of dilution\xe2\x80\x9d is based on \xe2\x80\x9ca misreading of the governing law,\xe2\x80\x9d however, there is reversible error.  <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1022.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Appellants have satisfied all three <em>Gingles</em> requirements as to District 23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the problem.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second and third <em>Gingles </em>factors\xe2\x80\x94Latino cohesion, majority bloc voting\xe2\x80\x94are present, given the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of racially polarized voting in the District 23 and throughout the State.  As to the first <em>Gingles </em>precondition\xe2\x80\x94that the minority group be large and compact enough to constitute a majority in a single-member district, 478 U. S., at 50\xe2\x80\x94appellants have established that Latinos could have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines not been altered and that they do not have one now.  They constituted a majority of the citizen voting age population in District 23 under Plan 1151C.  The District Court suggested incorrectly that the district was not a Latino opportunity district in 2002 simply because the incumbent prevailed.  The fact that a group does not win elections does not resolve the vote dilution issue.  <em>De Grandy, </em>512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 1014, n.\xc2\xa011.  In old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration and overall population, the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in each successive election, the near victory of the Latino candidate of choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s continued election were the very reasons the State redrew the district lines.  Since the redistricting prevented the immediate success of the emergent Latino majority in District 23, there was a denial of opportunity in the real sense of that term.  Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s version of District 23, by contrast, is unquestionably not a Latino opportunity district.  That Latinos are now a bare majority of the district\xe2\x80\x99s voting-age population is not dispositive, since the relevant numbers must account for citizenship in order to determine the group\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to elect candidates, and Latinos do not now have a citizen voting-age majority in the district.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it met its \xc2\xa72 obligations by creating new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district is rejected.  In a district line-drawing challenge, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first <em>Gingles</em> condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 1008.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the current plan contains six Latino opportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts, as proposed by appellant GI Forum, could not be drawn was not clearly erroneous.  However, the court failed to perform the required compactness inquiry between the number of Latino opportunity districts under the challenger\xe2\x80\x99s proposal of reinstating Plan 1151C and the \xe2\x80\x9cexisting number of reasonably compact districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>Section 2 does not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district, <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a>, 999, but such a district cannot remedy a violation elsewhere in the State, see <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Hunt,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/899/index.html">517 U. S. 899</a>, 916.  The lower court recognized there was a 300-mile gap between the two Latino communities in District 25, and a similarly large gap between the needs and interests of the two groups.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made the district compact, despite this combining of discrete communities of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed the issue only in the equal protection context, where compactness focuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant factor in drawing those lines.  See <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 916\xe2\x80\x93917.  Under \xc2\xa72, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the compactness inquiry considers \xe2\x80\x9cthe compactness of the minority population, not \xe2\x80\xa6 the compactness of the contested district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vera, </em>517 U. S., at 997.  A district that \xe2\x80\x9creaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities\xe2\x80\x9d is not reasonably compact.  <em>Id.,</em> at 979.  The lower court\xe2\x80\x99s findings regarding the different characteristics, needs, and interests of the two widely scattered Latino communities in District 23 are well supported and uncontested.  The enormous geographical distances separating the two communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populations\xe2\x80\x94not either factor alone\xe2\x80\x94renders District 25 noncompact for \xc2\xa72 purposes.  Therefore, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts, one fewer than Plan 1151C.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9329.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The totality of the circumstances demonstrates a \xc2\xa72 violation.  The relevant proportionality inquiry, see <em>De Grandy, </em>512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 1000, compares the percentage of total districts that are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that proportionality should be decided on a regional basis is rejected in favor of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that their claim requires a statewide analysis because they have alleged statewide vote dilution based on a statewide plan.  Looking statewide, there are 32 congressional districts.  The five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts amount to roughly 16% of the total, while Latinos make up 22% of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 citizen voting-age population.  Latinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional representation.  Even deeming this disproportionality insubstantial would not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos in District 23.  The changes there undermined the progress of a racial group that has been subject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically active and cohesive.  Cf., <em>e.g., id., </em>at 1014.  Against this background, the Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 diminishing electoral support for the incumbent indicates their belief he was unresponsive to their particularized needs.  In essence, the State took away their opportunity because they were about to exercise it.  Even accepting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s action was taken primarily for political, not racial, reasons, the redrawing of District 23\xe2\x80\x99s lines was damaging to its Latino voters.  The State not only made fruitless the Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 mobilization efforts but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically active.  Although incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor in districting, see <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>Daggett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/index.html">462 U. S. 725</a>, 740, not all of its forms are in the interests of the constituents.  If, as here, such protection means excluding some voters from the district simply because they are likely to vote against the officeholder, the change is to benefit the officeholder, not the voters.  This policy, whatever its validity in the political realm, cannot justify the effect on Latino voters.  See <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 45.  Pp.\xc2\xa029\xe2\x80\x9336.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0Because Plan 1374C violates \xc2\xa72 in its redrawing of District 23, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment and equal protection claims with respect to that district need not be addressed.  Their equal protection claim as to the drawing of District 25 need not be confronted because that district will have to be redrawn to remedy the District 23 violation.  Pp.\xc2\xa036\xe2\x80\x9337.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy concluded in Part II that because appellants have established no legally impermissible use of political classifications, they state no claim on which relief may be granted as to their contention that Texas\xe2\x80\x99 statewide redistricting is an unconstitutional political gerrymander.  Justice Souter and Justice Ginsburg joined Part II\xe2\x80\x93D.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Article I of the Constitution, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72 and 4, gives \xe2\x80\x9cthe States primary responsibility for apportionment of their \xe2\x80\xa6 congressional \xe2\x80\xa6 districts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Growe</em> v. <em>Emison,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/25/index.html">507 U. S. 25</a>, 34, but \xc2\xa74 also permits Congress to set further requirements.  Neither the Constitution nor Congress has stated any explicit prohibition of mid-decade redistricting to change districts drawn earlier in conformance with a decennial census.  Although the legislative branch plays the primary role in congressional redistricting, courts have an important role when a districting plan violates the Constitution.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wesberry</em> v. <em>Sanders,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/1/index.html">376 U. S. 1</a>.  That the federal courts sometimes must order legislative redistricting, however, does not shift the primary responsibility away from legislative bodies, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wise</em> v. <em>Lipscomb,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/index.html">437 U. S. 535</a>, 540, who are free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their own, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Upham</em> v. <em>Seamon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/37/index.html">456 U. S. 37</a>, 44.  Judicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Appellants claim unpersuasively that a decision to effect mid-decennial redistricting, when solely motivated by partisan objectives, presumptively violates equal protection and the First Amendment because it serves no legitimate public purpose and burdens one group because of its political opinions and affiliation.  For a number of reasons, that test is unconvincing.  There is some merit to the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that partisan gain was not the sole motivation for replacing Plan 1151C: The contours of some contested district lines seem to have been drawn based on more mundane and local interests, and a number of line-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.  Moreover, a successful test for identifying unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering must do what appellants\xe2\x80\x99 sole-motivation theory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the complainants\xe2\x80\x99 representational rights.  See <em>Vieth, supra</em>, at 292\xe2\x80\x93295, 307\xe2\x80\x93308.  Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 sole-intent standard is no more compelling when it is linked to the circumstance that Plan 1374C is mid-decennial legislation.  The Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases indicate there is nothing inherently suspect about a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to replace mid-decade a court-ordered plan with one of its own.  Even if there were, the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders.  Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 test would leave untouched the 1991 Texas redistricting, which entrenched a party on the verge of minority status, while striking down the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the majority Republican Party capturing a larger share of the seats.  A test that treats these two similarly effective power plays in such different ways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 political gerrymandering theory that mid-decade redistricting for exclusively partisan purposes violates the one-person, one-vote requirement is rejected.  Although conceding that States operate under the legal fiction that their plans are constitutionally apportioned throughout a decade, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 488, n.\xc2\xa02, appellants contend that this fiction should not provide a safe harbor for a legislature that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan overriding a legal court-drawn plan.  This argument mirrors appellants\xe2\x80\x99 attack on mid-decennial redistricting solely motivated by partisan considerations and is unsatisfactory for the same reasons.  Their further contention that the legislature intentionally sought to manipulate population variances when it enacted Plan 1374C is unconvincing because there is no District Court finding to that effect, and they present no specific evidence to support this serious allegation of bad faith.  Because they have not demonstrated that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enact Plan 1374C constitutes a violation of the equal-population requirement, their subsidiary reliance on <em>Larios</em> v. <em>Cox</em>, 300 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1320, summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/947/index.html">542 U. S. 947</a>, is unavailing.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy, joined by The Chief Justice and Justice Alito, concluded in Part IV that the Dallas area redistricting does not violate \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.  Appellants allege that the Dallas changes dilute African-American voting strength because an African-American minority effectively controlled District 24 under Plan 1151C.  However, before Plan 1374C, District 24 had elected an Anglo Democrat to Congress in every election since 1978.  Since then, moreover, the incumbent has had no opposition in any of his primary elections, and African-Americans have consistently voted for him.  African-Americans were the second-largest racial group in the district after Anglos, but had only 25.7% of the citizen voting age population.  Even assuming that the first <em>Gingles</em> prong can accommodate appellants\xe2\x80\x99 assertion that a \xc2\xa72 claim may be stated for a racial group that makes up less than 50% of the population, see, <em>e.g., De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1009, they must show they constitute \xe2\x80\x9ca sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate of choice with the assistance of cross-over votes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Voinovich</em> v. <em>Quilter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/146/index.html">507 U. S. 146</a>, 158.  The District Court committed no clear error in rejecting questionable evidence that African-Americans have the ability to elect their candidate of choice in favor of other evidence that an African-American candidate of choice would not prevail.  See <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Bessemer City,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/index.html">470 U. S. 564</a>, 574.  That African-Americans had influence in the district does not suffice to state a \xc2\xa72 claim.  If it did, it would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 491.  <em>Id., </em>at 480, 482, distinguished.

The Chief Justice and Justice Alito therefore take no position on that question, which has divided the Court, see <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html">541 U.

Justice Scalia, joined by The Chief Justice, Justice Thomas, and Justice Alito, subjected the intentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district to strict scrutiny and held that standard satisfied because appellants conceded that the creation of this district was reasonably necessary to comply with \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which is a compelling state interest, and did not argue that Texas did more than that provision required it to do.

Convened as a three-judge court under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72284, the court heard appellants\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional and statutory challenges to a 2003 enactment of the Texas State Legislature that drew new district lines for the 32 seats Texas holds in the United States House of Representatives.  (Though appellants do not join each other as to all claims, for the sake of convenience we refer to appellants collectively.)  In 2004 the court entered judgment for appellees and issued detailed findings of fact and conclusions of law.  <em>Session</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 451 <em>(per curiam).</em>  This Court vacated that decision and remanded for consideration in light of <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html">541 U. S. 267</a> (2004).  <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/941/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/941/index.html">543 U. S. 941</a> (2004).  The District Court reexamined appellants\xe2\x80\x99 political gerrymandering claims and, in a second careful opinion, again held for the defendants.  <em>Henderson</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 756 (2005).  These appeals followed, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  546 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants contend the new plan is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander and that the redistricting statewide violates \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79 Stat. 437, as amended, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973.  Appellants also contend that the use of race and politics in drawing lines of specific districts violates the First Amendment and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The three-judge panel, consisting of Circuit Judge Higginbotham and District Judges Ward and Rosenthal, brought considerable experience and expertise to the instant case, based on their knowledge of the State\xe2\x80\x99s people, history, and geography.  Judges Higginbotham and Ward, moreover, had served on the three-judge court that drew the plan the Texas Legislature replaced in 2003, so they were intimately familiar with the history and intricacies of the cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s dispositions on the statewide political gerrymandering claims and the Voting Rights Act claim against District 24.  We reverse and remand on the Voting Rights Act claim with respect to District 23.  Because we do not reach appellants\xe2\x80\x99 race-based equal protection claim or the political gerrymandering claim as to District 23, we vacate the judgment of the District Court on these claims.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To set out a proper framework for the case, we first recount the history of the litigation and recent districting in Texas.  An appropriate starting point is not the reapportionment in 2000 but the one from the census in 1990.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The 1990 census resulted in a 30-seat congressional delegation for Texas, an increase of 3 seats over the 27 representatives allotted to the State in the decade before.  See <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a>, 956\xe2\x80\x93957 (1996).  In 1991 the Texas Legislature drew new district lines.  At the time, the Democratic Party controlled both houses in the state legislature, the governorship, and 19 of the State\xe2\x80\x99s 27 seats in Congress.  Yet change appeared to be on the horizon.  In the previous 30 years the Democratic Party\xe2\x80\x99s post-Reconstruction dominance over the Republican Party had eroded, and by 1990 the Republicans received 47% of the statewide vote, while the Democrats received 51%.  <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 763; Brief for Appellee Perry et\xc2\xa0al.\nin No. 05\xe2\x80\x93204, etc., p.\xc2\xa02 (hereinafter Brief for State\nAppellees).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Faced with a Republican opposition that could be moving toward majority status, the state legislature drew a congressional redistricting plan designed to favor Democratic candidates.  Using then-emerging computer technology to draw district lines with artful precision, the legislature enacted a plan later described as the \xe2\x80\x9cshrewdest gerrymander of the 1990s.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Barone, R. Cohen, &amp; C. Cook, Almanac of American Politics 2002, p. 1448 (2001).  See <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 767, and n. 47.  Although the 1991 plan was enacted by the state legislature, Democratic Congressman Martin Frost was acknowledged as its architect.  <em>Session</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 482.  The 1991 plan \xe2\x80\x9ccarefully constructs democratic districts \xe2\x80\x98with incredibly convoluted lines\xe2\x80\x99 and packs \xe2\x80\x98heavily Republican\xe2\x80\x99 suburban areas into just a few districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 767, n. 47 (quoting M. Barone &amp; R. Cohen, Almanac of American Politics 2004, p. 1510 (2003) (hereinafter 2004 Almanac)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Voters who considered this unfair and unlawful treatment sought to invalidate the 1991 plan as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, but to no avail.  See <em>Terrazas</em> v. <em>Slagle</em>, 789 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 828, 833 (WD Tex. 1992); <em>Terrazas</em> v. <em>Slagle</em>, 821 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1162, 1175 (WD Tex. 1993).  The 1991 plan realized the hopes of Democrats and the fears of Republicans with respect to the composition of the Texas congressional delegation.  The 1990\xe2\x80\x99s were years of continued growth for the Texas Republican Party, and by the end of the decade it was sweeping elections for statewide office.  Nevertheless, despite carrying 59% of the vote in statewide elections in 2000, the Republicans only won 13 congressional seats to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 17.  <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 763.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These events likely were not forgotten by either party when it came time to draw congressional districts in conformance with the 2000 census and to incorporate two additional seats for the Texas delegation.  The Republican Party controlled the governorship and the State Senate; it did not yet control the State House of Representatives, however.  As so constituted, the legislature was unable to pass a redistricting scheme, resulting in litigation and the necessity of a court-ordered plan to comply with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s one-person, one-vote requirement.  See <em>Balderas</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, Civ. Action No. 6:01CV158 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001) <em>(per curiam),</em> summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/919/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/919/index.html">536 U. S. 919</a> (2002), App. E to Juris. Statement in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93276, p. 202a.  The congressional districting map resulting from the <em>Balderas</em> litigation is known as Plan 1151C.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we have said, two members of the three-judge court that drew Plan 1151C later served on the three-judge court that issued the judgment now under review.  Thus we have the benefit of their candid comments concerning the redistricting approach taken in the <em>Balderas</em> litigation.  Conscious that the primary responsibility for drawing congressional districts is given to political branches of government, and hesitant to \xe2\x80\x9cund[o] the work of one political party for the benefit of another,\xe2\x80\x9d the three-judge <em>Balderas</em> court sought to apply \xe2\x80\x9conly \xe2\x80\x98neutral\xe2\x80\x99 redistricting standards\xe2\x80\x9d when drawing Plan 1151C.  <em>Henderson</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 768.  Once the District Court applied these principles\xe2\x80\x94such as placing the two new seats in high-growth areas, following county and voting precinct lines, and avoiding the pairing of incumbents\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe drawing ceased, leaving the map free of further change except to conform it to one-person, one-vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Under Plan 1151C, the 2002 congressional elections resulted in a 17-to-15 Democratic majority in the Texas delegation, compared to a 59% to 40% Republican majority in votes for statewide office in 2000.  <em>Id.</em>, at 763\xe2\x80\x93764.  Reflecting on the <em>Balderas</em> Plan, the District Court in <em>Henderson</em> was candid to acknowledge \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he practical effect of this effort was to leave the 1991 Democratic Party gerrymander largely in place as a \xe2\x80\x98legal\xe2\x80\x99 plan.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 768.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The continuing influence of a court-drawn map that \xe2\x80\x9cperpetuated much of [the 1991] gerrymander,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, was not lost on Texas Republicans when, in 2003, they gained control of the State House of Representatives and, thus, both houses of the legislature.  The Republicans in the legislature \xe2\x80\x9cset out to increase their representation in the congressional delegation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 471.  See also <em>id</em>., at 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is little question but that the single-minded purpose of the Texas Legislature in enacting [a new plan] was to gain partisan advantage\xe2\x80\x9d).  After a protracted partisan struggle, during which Democratic legislators left the State for a time to frustrate quorum requirements, the legislature enacted a new congressional districting map in October 2003.  It is called Plan 1374C.  The 2004 congressional elections did not disappoint the plan\xe2\x80\x99s drafters.  Republicans won 21 seats to the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 11, while also obtaining 58% of the vote in statewide races against the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 41%.  <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 764.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Soon after Texas enacted Plan 1374C, appellants challenged it in court, alleging a host of constitutional and statutory violations.  Initially, the District Court entered judgment against appellants on all their claims.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 457; <em>id.</em>, at 515 (Ward, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Appellants sought relief here and, after their jurisdictional statements were filed, this Court issued <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer</em>.  Our order vacating the District Court judgment and remanding for consideration in light of <em>Vieth</em> was issued just weeks before the 2004 elections.  See <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/941/index.html"></a><a href="/us/543/941/index.html">543 U. S. 941</a> (Oct. 18, 2004).  On remand, the District Court, believing the scope of its mandate was limited to questions of political gerrymandering, again rejected appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  <em>Henderson</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 777\xe2\x80\x93778.  Judge Ward would have granted relief under the theory\xe2\x80\x94presented to the court for the first time on remand\xe2\x80\x94that mid-decennial redistricting violates the one-person, one-vote requirement, but he concluded such an argument was not within the scope of the remand mandate.  <em>Id.</em>, at 779, 784\xe2\x80\x93785 (specially concurring).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on two similar theories that address the mid-decade character of the 2003 redistricting, appellants now argue that Plan 1374C should be invalidated as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  In <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Bandemer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/109/index.html">478 U. S. 109</a> (1986), the Court held that an equal protection challenge to a political gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversy, <em>id.</em>, at 118\xe2\x80\x93127, but there was disagreement over what substantive standard to apply.  Compare <em>id.</em>, at 127\xe2\x80\x93137 (plurality opinion) with <em>id.</em>, at 161\xe2\x80\x93162 (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  That disagreement persists.  A plurality of the Court in <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer</em> would have held such challenges to be nonjusticiable political questions, but a majority declined to do so.  See 541 U. S., at 306 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id.</em>, at 317 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 343 (Souter, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 355 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  We do not revisit the justiciability holding but do proceed to examine whether appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims offer the Court a manageable, reliable measure of fairness for determining whether a partisan gerrymander violates the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before addressing appellants\xe2\x80\x99 arguments on mid-decade redistricting, it is appropriate to note some basic principles on the roles the States, Congress, and the courts play in determining how congressional districts are to be drawn.

When Texas did not enact a plan to comply with the one-person, one-vote requirement under the 2000 census, the District Court found it necessary to draw a redistricting map on its own.  That the federal courts sometimes are required to order legislative redistricting, however, does not shift the primary locus of responsibility.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cLegislative bodies should not leave their reapportionment tasks to the federal courts; but when those with legislative responsibilities do not respond, or the imminence of a state election makes it impractical for them to do so, it becomes the \xe2\x80\x98unwelcome obligation\xe2\x80\x99 of the federal court to devise and impose a reapportionment plan pending later legislative action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wise</em> v. <em>Lipscomb,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/535/index.html">437 U. S. 535</a>, 540 (1978) (principal opinion) (quoting <em>Connor</em> v. <em>Finch,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/407/index.html">431 U. S. 407</a>, 415 (1977)).</p>\n<p align="left">\nQuite apart from the risk of acting without a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s expertise, and quite apart from the difficulties a court faces in drawing a map that is fair and rational, see <em>id.</em>, at 414\xe2\x80\x93415, the obligation placed upon the Federal Judiciary is unwelcome because drawing lines for congressional districts is one of the most significant acts a State can perform to ensure citizen participation in republican self-governance.  That Congress is the federal body explicitly given constitutional power over elections is also a noteworthy statement of preference for the democratic process.  As the Constitution vests redistricting responsibilities foremost in the legislatures of the States and in Congress, a lawful, legislatively enacted plan should be preferable to one drawn by the courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It should follow, too, that if a legislature acts to replace a court-drawn plan with one of its own design, no presumption of impropriety should attach to the legislative decision to act.  As the District Court noted here, <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 460\xe2\x80\x93461, our decisions have assumed that state legislatures are free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their own.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Upham</em> v. <em>Seamon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/37/index.html">456 U. S. 37</a>, 44 (1982) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Wise</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 540 (principal opinion) (quoting <em>Connor</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 415); <em>Burns </em>v.<em> Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/73/index.html">384 U. S. 73</a>, 85 (1966); <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>Sims,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/index.html">377 U. S. 533</a>, 587 (1964).  Underlying this principle is the assumption that to prefer a court-drawn plan to a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s replacement would be contrary to the ordinary and proper operation of the political process.  Judicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations.  With these considerations in mind, we next turn to consider appellants\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the new redistricting plan.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants claim that Plan 1374C, enacted by the Texas Legislature in 2003, is an unconstitutional political gerrymander.  A decision, they claim, to effect mid-decennial redistricting, when solely motivated by partisan objectives, violates equal protection and the First Amendment because it serves no legitimate public purpose and burdens one group because of its political opinions and affiliation.  The mid-decennial nature of the redistricting, appellants say, reveals the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s sole motivation.  Unlike <em>Vieth</em>, where the legislature acted in the context of a required decennial redistricting, the Texas Legislature voluntarily replaced a plan that itself was designed to comply with new census data.  Because Texas had \xe2\x80\x9cno constitutional obligation to act at all\xe2\x80\x9d in 2003, Brief for Appellant Jackson et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93276, p. 26, it is hardly surprising, according to appellants, that the District Court found \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is little question but that the single-minded purpose of the Texas Legislature in enacting Plan 1374C was to gain partisan advantage\xe2\x80\x9d for the Republican majority over the Democratic minority, <em>Session</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 470.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A rule, or perhaps a presumption, of invalidity when a mid-decade redistricting plan is adopted solely for partisan motivations is a salutary one, in appellants\xe2\x80\x99 view, for then courts need not inquire about, nor parties prove, the discriminatory effects of partisan gerrymandering\xe2\x80\x94a matter that has proved elusive since <em>Bandemer</em>.  See <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 281 (plurality opinion); <em>Bandemer</em>, 478 U. S., at 127.  Adding to the test\xe2\x80\x99s simplicity is that it does not quibble with the drawing of individual district lines but challenges the decision to redistrict at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For a number of reasons, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 case for adopting their test is not convincing.  To begin with, the state appellees dispute the assertion that partisan gain was the \xe2\x80\x9csole\xe2\x80\x9d motivation for the decision to replace Plan 1151C.  There is some merit to that criticism, for the pejorative label overlooks indications that partisan motives did not dictate the plan in its entirety.  The legislature does seem to have decided to redistrict with the sole purpose of achieving a Republican congressional majority, but partisan aims did not guide every line it drew.  As the District Court found, the contours of some contested district lines were drawn based on more mundane and local interests.  <em>Session</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 472\xe2\x80\x93473.  The state appellees also contend, and appellants do not contest, that a number of line-drawing requests by Democratic state legislators were honored.  Brief for State Appellees 34.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Evaluating the legality of acts arising out of mixed motives can be complex, and affixing a single label to those acts can be hazardous, even when the actor is an individual performing a discrete act.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Hartman</em> v. <em>Moore</em>, 547 U. S. ___, ___ (2006) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310).  When the actor is a legislature and the act is a composite of manifold choices, the task can be even more daunting.  Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to separate the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s sole motive for discarding Plan 1151C from the complex of choices it made while drawing the lines of Plan 1374C seeks to avoid that difficulty.  We are skeptical, however, of a claim that seeks to invalidate a statute based on a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful motive but does so without reference to the content of the legislation enacted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even setting this skepticism aside, a successful claim attempting to identify unconstitutional acts of partisan gerrymandering must do what appellants\xe2\x80\x99 sole-motivation theory explicitly disavows: show a burden, as measured by a reliable standard, on the complainants\xe2\x80\x99 representational rights.  For this reason, a majority of the Court rejected a test proposed in <em>Vieth</em> that is markedly similar to the one appellants present today.  Compare 541 U. S., at 336 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cJust as race can be a factor in, but cannot dictate the outcome of, the districting process, so too can partisanship be a permissible consideration in drawing district lines, so long as it does not predominate\xe2\x80\x9d), and <em>id.</em>, at 338 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n acceptable rational basis can be neither purely personal nor purely partisan\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>id.</em>, at 292\xe2\x80\x93295 (plurality opinion), and <em>id.</em>, at 307\xe2\x80\x93308 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sole-intent standard offered here is no more compelling when it is linked to the circumstance that Plan 1374C is mid-decennial legislation.  The text and structure of the Constitution and our case law indicate there is nothing inherently suspect about a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to replace mid-decade a court-ordered plan with one of its own.  And even if there were, the fact of mid-decade redistricting alone is no sure indication of unlawful political gerrymanders.  Under appellants\xe2\x80\x99 theory, a highly effective partisan gerrymander that coincided with decennial redistricting would receive less scrutiny than a bumbling, yet solely partisan, mid-decade redistricting.  More concretely, the test would leave untouched the 1991 Texas redistricting, which entrenched a party on the verge of minority status, while striking down the 2003 redistricting plan, which resulted in the majority Republican Party capturing a larger share of the seats.  A test that treats these two similarly effective power plays in such different ways does not have the reliability appellants ascribe to it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, compared to the map challenged in <em>Vieth</em>, which led to a Republican majority in the congressional delegation despite a Democratic majority in the statewide vote, Plan 1374C can be seen as making the party balance more congruent to statewide party power.  To be sure, there is no constitutional requirement of proportional representation, and equating a party\xe2\x80\x99s statewide share of the vote with its portion of the congressional delegation is a rough measure at best.  Nevertheless, a congressional plan that more closely reflects the distribution of state party power seems a less likely vehicle for partisan discrimination than one that entrenches an electoral minority.  See <em>Gaffney</em> v. <em>Cummings,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/index.html">412 U. S. 735</a>, 754 (1973).  By this measure, Plan 1374C can be seen as fairer than the plan that survived in <em>Vieth</em> and the two previous Texas plans\xe2\x80\x94all three of which would pass the modified sole-intent test that Plan 1374C would fail.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A brief for one of the <em>amici</em> proposes a symmetry standard that would measure partisan bias by \xe2\x80\x9ccompar[ing] how both parties would fare hypothetically if they each (in turn) had received a given percentage of the vote.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Gary King et\xc2\xa0al. 5.  Under that standard the measure of a map\xe2\x80\x99s bias is the extent to which a majority party would fare better than the minority party should their respective shares of the vote reverse.  In our view <em>amici</em>\xe2\x80\x99s proposed standard does not compensate for appellants\xe2\x80\x99 failure to provide a reliable measure of fairness.  The existence or degree of asymmetry may in large part depend on conjecture about where possible vote-switchers will reside.  Even assuming a court could choose reliably among different models of shifting voter preferences, we are wary of adopting a constitutional standard that invalidates a map based on unfair results that would occur in a hypothetical state of affairs.  Presumably such a challenge could be litigated if and when the feared inequity arose.  Cf. <em>Abbott Laboratories</em> v. <em>Gardner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/index.html">387 U. S. 136</a>, 148 (1967).  More fundamentally, the counterfactual plaintiff would face the same problem as the present, actual appellants: providing a standard for deciding how much partisan dominance is too much.  Without altogether discounting its utility in redistricting planning and litigation, we conclude asymmetry alone is not a reliable measure of unconstitutional partisanship.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the absence of any other workable test for judging partisan gerrymanders, one effect of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 focus on mid-decade redistricting could be to encourage partisan excess at the outset of the decade, when a legislature redistricts pursuant to its decennial constitutional duty and is then immune from the charge of sole-motivation.  If mid-decade redistricting were barred or at least subject to close judicial oversight, opposition legislators would also have every incentive to prevent passage of a legislative plan and try their luck with a court that might give them a better deal than negotiation with their political rivals.  See <em>Henderson</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 776\xe2\x80\x93777.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 second political gerrymandering theory is that mid-decade redistricting for exclusively partisan purposes violates the one-person, one-vote requirement.  They observe that population variances in legislative districts are tolerated only if they \xe2\x80\x9care unavoidable despite a good-faith effort to achieve absolute equality, or for which justification is shown.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>Daggett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/index.html">462 U. S. 725</a>, 730 (1983) (quoting <em>Kirkpatrick</em> v. <em>Preisler,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/526/index.html">394 U. S. 526</a>, 531 (1969); internal quotation marks omitted).  Working from this unchallenged premise, appellants contend that, because the population of Texas has shifted since the 2000 census, the 2003 redistricting, which relied on that census, created unlawful interdistrict population variances.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To distinguish the variances in Plan 1374C from those of ordinary, 3-year-old districting plans or belatedly drawn court-ordered plans, appellants again rely on the voluntary, mid-decade nature of the redistricting and its partisan motivation.  Appellants do not contend that a decennial redistricting plan would violate equal representation three or five years into the decade if the State\xe2\x80\x99s population had shifted substantially.  As they must, they concede that States operate under the legal fiction that their plans are constitutionally apportioned throughout the decade, a presumption that is necessary to avoid constant redistricting, with accompanying costs and instability.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 488, n. 2 (2003); <em>Reynolds</em>, 377 U. S., at 583.  Appellants agree that a plan implemented by a court in 2001 using 2000 population data also enjoys the benefit of the so-called legal fiction, presumably because belated court-drawn plans promote other important interests, such as ensuring a plan complies with the Constitution and voting rights legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In appellants\xe2\x80\x99 view, however, this fiction should not provide a safe harbor for a legislature that enacts a voluntary, mid-decade plan overriding a legal court-drawn plan, thus \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unnecessarily\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d creating population variance \xe2\x80\x9cwhen there was no legal compulsion\xe2\x80\x9d to do so.  Brief for Appellant Travis County et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93254, p. 18.  This is particularly so, appellants say, when a legislature acts because of an exclusively partisan motivation.  Under appellants\xe2\x80\x99 theory this improper motive at the outset seems enough to condemn the map for violating the equal-population principle.  For this reason, appellants believe that the State cannot justify under <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>Daggett</em> the population variances in Plan 1374C because they are the product of partisan bias and the desire to eliminate all competitive districts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the District Court noted, this is a test that turns not on whether a redistricting furthers equal-population principles but rather on the justification for redrawing a plan in the first place.  <em>Henderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 776.  In that respect appellants\xe2\x80\x99 approach merely restates the question whether it was permissible for the Texas Legislature to redraw the districting map.  Appellants\xe2\x80\x99 answer, which mirrors their attack on mid-decennial redistricting solely motivated by partisan considerations, is unsatisfactory for reasons we have already discussed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants also contend that the legislature intentionally sought to manipulate population variances when it enacted Plan 1374C.  There is, however, no District Court finding to that effect, and appellants present no specific evidence to support this serious allegation of bad faith.  Because appellants have not demonstrated that the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to enact Plan 1374C constitutes a violation of the equal-population requirement, we find unavailing their subsidiary reliance on <em>Larios</em> v. <em>Cox</em>, 300 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1320 (ND Ga. 2004) <em>(per curiam),</em> summarily aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/947/index.html">542 U. S. 947</a> (2004).  In <em>Larios</em>, the District Court reviewed the Georgia Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decennial redistricting of its State Senate and House of Representatives districts and found deviations from the equal-population requirement.  The District Court then held the objectives of the drafters, which included partisan interests along with regionalist bias and inconsistent incumbent protection, did not justify those deviations.  300 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1351\xe2\x80\x931352.  The <em>Larios</em> holding and its examination of the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s motivations were relevant only in response to an equal-population violation, something appellants have not established here.  Even in addressing political motivation as a justification for an equal-population violation, moreover, <em>Larios</em> does not give clear guidance.  The panel explained it \xe2\x80\x9cneed not resolve the issue of whether or when partisan advantage alone may justify deviations in population\xe2\x80\x9d because the plans were \xe2\x80\x9cplainly unlawful\xe2\x80\x9d and any partisan motivations were \xe2\x80\x9cbound up inextricably\xe2\x80\x9d with other clearly rejected objectives.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1352.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we disagree with appellants\xe2\x80\x99 view that a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to override a valid, court-drawn plan mid-decade is sufficiently suspect to give shape to a reliable standard for identifying unconstitutional political gerrymanders.  We conclude that appellants have established no legally impermissible use of political classifications.  For this reason, they state no claim on which relief may be granted for their statewide challenge.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plan 1374C made changes to district lines in south and west Texas that appellants challenge as violations of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The most significant changes occurred to District 23, which\xe2\x80\x94both before and after the redistricting\xe2\x80\x94covers a large land area in west Texas, and to District 25, which earlier included Houston but now includes a different area, a north-south strip from Austin to the Rio Grande Valley.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After the 2002 election, it became apparent that District 23 as then drawn had an increasingly powerful Latino population that threatened to oust the incumbent Republican, Henry Bonilla.  Before the 2003 redistricting, the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population was 57.5%, and Bonilla\xe2\x80\x99s support among Latinos had dropped with each successive election since 1996.  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.  In 2002, Bonilla captured only 8% of the Latino vote, <em>ibid.</em>, and 51.5% of the overall vote.  Faced with this loss of voter support, the legislature acted to protect Bonilla\xe2\x80\x99s incumbency by changing the lines\xe2\x80\x94and hence the population mix\xe2\x80\x94of the district.  To begin with, the new plan divided Webb County and the city of Laredo, on the Mexican border, that formed the county\xe2\x80\x99s population base.  Webb County, which is 94% Latino, had previously rested entirely within District 23; under the new plan, nearly 100,000 people were shifted into neighboring District 28.  <em>Id.,</em> at 489.  The rest of the county, approximately 93,000 people, remained in District 23.  To replace the numbers District 23 lost, the State added voters in counties comprising a largely Anglo, Republican area in central Texas.  <em>Id.,</em> at 488.  In the newly drawn district, the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population dropped to 46%, though the Latino share of the total voting-age population remained just over 50%.  <em>Id.,</em> at 489.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These changes required adjustments elsewhere, of course, so the State inserted a third district between the two districts to the east of District 23, and extended all three of them farther north.  New District 25 is a long, narrow strip that winds its way from McAllen and the Mexican border towns in the south to Austin, in the center of the State and 300 miles away.  <em>Id.,</em> at 502.  In between it includes seven full counties, but 77% of its population resides in split counties at the northern and southern ends.  Of this 77%, roughly half reside in Hidalgo County, which includes McAllen, and half are in Travis County, which includes parts of Austin.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Latinos in District 25, comprising 55% of the district\xe2\x80\x99s citizen voting-age population, are also mostly divided between the two distant areas, north and south.  <em>Id.,</em> at 499.  The Latino communities at the opposite ends of District 25 have divergent \xe2\x80\x9cneeds and interests,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 502, owing to \xe2\x80\x9cdifferences in socio-economic status, education, employment, health, and other characteristics,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> id.</em>, at 512.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court summed up the purposes underlying the redistricting in south and west Texas: \xe2\x80\x9cThe change to Congressional District 23 served the dual goal of increasing Republican seats in general and protecting Bonilla\xe2\x80\x99s incumbency in particular, with the additional political nuance that Bonilla would be reelected in a district that had a majority of Latino voting age population\xe2\x80\x94although clearly not a majority of citizen voting age population and certainly not an effective voting majority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 497.  The goal in creating District 25 was just as clear: \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o avoid retrogression under \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x9d of the Voting Rights Act given the reduced Latino voting strength in District 23.  <em>Id.,</em> at 489.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question we address is whether Plan 1374C violates \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.

For this purpose, the Court has referred to the Senate Report on the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act, which identifies factors typically relevant to a \xc2\xa72 claim, including:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe history of voting-related discrimination in the State or political subdivision; the extent to which voting in the elections of the State or political subdivision is racially polarized; the extent to which the State or political subdivision has used voting practices or procedures that tend to enhance the opportunity for discrimination against the minority group . . . ; the extent to which minority group members bear the effects of past discrimination in areas such as education, employment, and health, which hinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process; the use of overt or subtle racial appeals in political campaigns; and the extent to which members of the minority group have been elected to public office in the jurisdiction.  The Report notes also that evidence demonstrating that elected officials are unresponsive to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group and that the policy underlying the State\xe2\x80\x99s or the political subdivision\xe2\x80\x99s use of the contested practice or structure is tenuous may have probative value.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (citing S. Rep. No. 97\xe2\x80\x93417 (1982) (hereinafter Senate Report); pinpoint citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another relevant consideration is whether the number of districts in which the minority group forms an effective majority is roughly proportional to its share of the population in the relevant area.  <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1000.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether the \xc2\xa72 requirements are satisfied must be upheld unless clearly erroneous.  See <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 78\xe2\x80\x9379.  Where \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate finding of dilution\xe2\x80\x9d is based on \xe2\x80\x9ca misreading of the governing law,\xe2\x80\x9d however, there is reversible error.  <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1022.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants argue that the changes to District 23 diluted the voting rights of Latinos who remain in the district.  Specifically, the redrawing of lines in District 23 caused the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population to drop from 57.5% to 46%.  The District Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cLatino voting strength in Congressional District 23 is, unquestionably, weakened under Plan 1374C.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 497.  The question is whether this weakening amounts to vote dilution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin the <em>Gingles</em> analysis, it is evident that the second and third <em>Gingles</em> preconditions\xe2\x80\x94cohesion among the minority group and bloc voting among the majority population\xe2\x80\x94are present in District 23.  The District Court found \xe2\x80\x9cracially polarized voting\xe2\x80\x9d in south and west Texas, and indeed \xe2\x80\x9cthroughout the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, supra,</em> at 492\xe2\x80\x93493.  The polarization in District 23 was especially severe: 92% of Latinos voted against Bonilla in 2002, while 88% of non-Latinos voted for him.  App. 134, Table 20 (expert Report of Allan J. Lichtman on Voting-Rights Issues in Texas Congressional Redistricting (Nov. 14, 2002) (hereinafter Lichtman Report)).  Furthermore, the projected results in new District 23 show that the Anglo citizen voting-age majority will often, if not always, prevent Latinos from electing the candidate of their choice in the district.  <em>Session, supra</em>, at 496\xe2\x80\x93497.  For all these reasons, appellants demonstrated sufficient minority cohesion and majority bloc voting to meet the second and third <em>Gingles</em> requirements.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first <em>Gingles</em> factor requires that a group be \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>478 U. S., at 50.  Latinos in District 23 could have constituted a majority of the citizen voting-age population in the district, and in fact did so under Plan 1151C.  Though it may be possible for a citizen voting-age majority to lack real electoral opportunity, the Latino majority in old District 23 did possess electoral opportunity protected by \xc2\xa72.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the District Court stated that District 23 had not been an effective opportunity district under Plan 1151C, it recognized the district was \xe2\x80\x9cmoving in that direction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 489.  Indeed, by 2002 the Latino candidate of choice in District 23 won the majority of the district\xe2\x80\x99s votes in 13 out of 15 elections for statewide officeholders.  <em>Id.,</em> at 518 (Ward, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  And in the congressional race, Bonilla could not have prevailed without some Latino support, limited though it was.  State legislators changed District 23 specifically because they worried that Latinos would vote Bonilla out of office.  <em>Id.,</em> at 488.  </f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, to the extent the District Court suggested that District 23 was not a Latino opportunity district in 2002 simply because Bonilla prevailed, see <em>id.,</em> at 488, 495, it was incorrect.  The circumstance that a group does not win elections does not resolve the issue of vote dilution.  We have said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate right of \xc2\xa72 is equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success for minority-preferred candidates of whatever race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Grandy,</em> 512 U. S., at 1014, n.\xc2\xa011.  In old District 23 the increase in Latino voter registration and overall population, <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 523 (Ward, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the concomitant rise in Latino voting power in each successive election, the near-victory of the Latino candidate of choice in 2002, and the resulting threat to the Bonilla incumbency, were the very reasons that led the State to redraw the district lines.  Since the redistricting prevented the immediate success of the emergent Latino majority in District 23, there was a denial of opportunity in the real sense of that term.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s version of District 23, by contrast, \xe2\x80\x9cis unquestionably not a Latino opportunity district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 496.  Latinos, to be sure, are a bare majority of the voting-age population in new District 23, but only in a hollow sense, for the parties agree that the relevant numbers must include citizenship.  This approach fits the language of \xc2\xa72 because only eligible voters affect a group\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to elect candidates.  In sum, appellants have established that Latinos could have had an opportunity district in District 23 had its lines not been altered and that they do not have one now.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considering the district in isolation, the three <em>Gingles</em> requirements are satisfied.  The State argues, nonetheless, that it met its \xc2\xa72 obligations by creating new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district.  It is true, of course, that \xe2\x80\x9cStates retain broad discretion in drawing districts to comply with the mandate of \xc2\xa72.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Hunt,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/899/index.html">517 U. S. 899</a>, 917, n.\xc2\xa09 (1996) <em>(Shaw II)</em>.  This principle has limits, though.  The Court has rejected the premise that a State can always make up for the less-than-equal opportunity of some individuals by providing greater opportunity to others.  See <em>id.,</em> at 917 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe vote-dilution injuries suffered by these persons are not remedied by creating a safe majority-black district somewhere else in the State\xe2\x80\x9d).  As set out below, these conflicting concerns are resolved by allowing the State to use one majority-minority district to compensate for the absence of another only when the racial group in each area had a \xc2\xa72 right and both could not be accommodated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the first <em>Gingles</em> requirement, it is not enough that appellants show the possibility of creating a majority-minority district that would include the Latinos in District 23.  See <em>Shaw II, supra,</em> at 917, n.\xc2\xa09 (rejecting the idea that \xe2\x80\x9ca \xc2\xa72 plaintiff has the right to be placed in a majority-minority district once a violation of the statute is shown\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the inclusion of the plaintiffs would necessitate the exclusion of others, then the State cannot be faulted for its choice.  That is why, in the context of a challenge to the drawing of district lines, \xe2\x80\x9cthe first <em>Gingles</em> condition requires the possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court found that the current plan contains six Latino opportunity districts and that seven reasonably compact districts could not be drawn.  Appellant GI Forum presented a plan with seven majority-Latino districts, but the District Court found these districts were not reasonably compact, in part because they took in \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate and distant communities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, supra</em>, at 491\xe2\x80\x93492, and n. 125.  While there was some evidence to the contrary, the court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of the conflicting evidence was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A problem remains, though, for the District Court failed to perform a comparable compactness inquiry for Plan 1374C as drawn.  <em>De Grandy</em> requires a comparison between a challenger\xe2\x80\x99s proposal and the \xe2\x80\x9cexisting number of reasonably compact districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 1008.  To be sure, \xc2\xa72 does not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district.  <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> 517 U. S., at 999 (Kennedy, J., concurring).  The noncompact district cannot, however, remedy a violation elsewhere in the State.  See <em>Shaw II, supra</em>, at 916 (unless \xe2\x80\x9cthe district contains a \xe2\x80\x98geographically compact\xe2\x80\x99 population\xe2\x80\x9d of the racial group, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere that district sits, \xe2\x80\x98there neither has been a wrong nor can be a remedy\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Growe, </em>507 U. S., at 41)).  Simply put, the State\xe2\x80\x99s creation of an opportunity district for those without a \xc2\xa72 right offers no excuse for its failure to provide an opportunity district for those with a \xc2\xa72 right.  And since there is no \xc2\xa72 right to a district that is not reasonably compact, see <em>Abrams,</em> 521 U. S., at 91\xe2\x80\x9392, the creation of a noncompact district does not compensate for the dismantling of a compact opportunity district. </p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Chief Justice claims compactness should be only a factor in the analysis, see <em>post,</em> at 16 (opinion concurring in part, concurring in judgment in part, and dissenting in part), but his approach comports neither with our precedents nor with the nature of the right established by \xc2\xa72.  <em>De Grandy</em> expressly stated that the first <em>Gingles</em> prong looks only to the number of \xe2\x80\x9creasonably compact districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 1008.  <em>Shaw II</em>, moreover, refused to consider a noncompact district as a possible remedy for a \xc2\xa72 violation.  517 U. S., at 916.  It is true <em>Shaw II</em> applied this analysis in the context of a State\xe2\x80\x99s using compliance with \xc2\xa72 as a defense to an equal protection challenge, but the holding was clear: A State cannot remedy a \xc2\xa72 violation through the creation of a noncompact district.  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>Shaw II</em> also cannot be distinguished based on the relative location of the remedial district as compared to the district of the alleged violation.  The remedial district in <em>Shaw II</em> had a 20% overlap with the district the plaintiffs sought, but the Court stated \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not think this degree of incorporation could mean [the remedial district] substantially addresses the \xc2\xa72 violation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 918; see also <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1019 (expressing doubt about the idea that even within the same county, vote dilution in half the county could be compensated for in the other half).  The overlap here is not substantially different, as the majority of Latinos who were in the old District 23 are still in the new District 23, but no longer have the opportunity to elect their candidate of choice.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from its conflict with <em>De Grandy</em> and <em>Shaw II</em>, The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s approach has the deficiency of creating a one-way rule whereby plaintiffs must show compactness but States need not (except, it seems, when using \xc2\xa72 as a defense to an equal protection challenge).  The Chief Justice appears to accept that a plaintiff, to make out a \xc2\xa72 violation, must show he or she is part of a racial group that could form a majority in a reasonably compact district.  <em>Post,</em> at 15.  If, however, a noncompact district cannot make up for the lack of a compact district, then this is equally true whether the plaintiff or the State proposes the noncompact district.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court stated that Plan 1374C created \xe2\x80\x9csix <em>Gingles</em> Latino\xe2\x80\x9d districts, <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 498, but it failed to decide whether District 25 was reasonably compact for \xc2\xa72 purposes.  It recognized there was a 300-mile gap between the Latino communities in District 25, and a similarly large gap between the needs and interests of the two groups.  <em>Id.</em>, at 502.  After making these observations, however, it did not make any finding about compactness.  <em>Id.,</em> at 502\xe2\x80\x93504.  It ruled instead that, despite these concerns, District 25 would be an effective Latino opportunity district because the combined voting strength of both Latino groups would allow a Latino-preferred candidate to prevail in elections.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s general finding of effectiveness cannot substitute for the lack of a finding on compactness, particularly because the District Court measured effectiveness simply by aggregating the voting strength of the two groups of Latinos.  <em>Id.,</em> at 503\xe2\x80\x93504.  Under the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, a district would satisfy \xc2\xa72 no matter how noncompact it was, so long as all the members of a racial group, added together, could control election outcomes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court did evaluate compactness for the purpose of deciding whether race predominated in the drawing of district lines.  The Latinos in the Rio Grande Valley and those in Central Texas, it found, are \xe2\x80\x9cdisparate communities of interest,\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cdifferences in socio-economic status, education, employment, health, and other characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 512.  The court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the relative smoothness of the district lines made the district compact, despite this combining of discrete communities of interest, is inapposite because the court analyzed the issue only for equal protection purposes.  In the equal protection context, compactness focuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant factor in drawing those lines.  See <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 916\xe2\x80\x93917 (1995).  Under \xc2\xa72, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the compactness inquiry embraces different considerations.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe first <em>Gingles</em> condition refers to the compactness of the minority population, not to the compactness of the contested district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vera, supra</em>, at 997 (Kennedy, J., concurring); see also <em>Abrams, supra</em>, at 111 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (compactness to show a violation of equal protection, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich concerns the shape or boundaries of a district, differs from \xc2\xa72 compactness, which concerns a minority group\xe2\x80\x99s compactness\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Shaw II, supra</em>,<em> </em>at 916 (the inquiry under \xc2\xa72 is whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe minority group is geographically compact\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While no precise rule has emerged governing \xc2\xa72 compactness, the \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry should take into account \xe2\x80\x98traditional districting principles such as maintaining communities of interest and traditional boundaries.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Abrams, supra</em>, at 92 (quoting <em>Vera, </em>517 U. S., at 977 (plurality opinion)); see also <em>id.,</em> at 979 (A district that \xe2\x80\x9creaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities\xe2\x80\x9d is not reasonably compact).  The recognition of nonracial communities of interest reflects the principle that a State may not \xe2\x80\x9cassum[e] from a group of voters\xe2\x80\x99 race that they \xe2\x80\x98think alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miller, supra</em>, at 920 (quoting <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Reno,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/630/index.html">509 U. S. 630</a>, 647 (1993)).  In the absence of this prohibited assumption, there is no basis to believe a district that combines two far-flung segments of a racial group with disparate interests provides the opportunity that \xc2\xa72 requires or that the first <em>Gingles</em> condition contemplates.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the Voting Rights Act is to prevent discrimination in the exercise of the electoral franchise and to foster our transformation to a society that is no longer fixated on race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 490 (2003); cf. <em>post,</em> at 20 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.).  We do a disservice to these important goals by failing to account for the differences between people of the same race.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the District Court recognized the relevant differences, by not performing the compactness inquiry it failed to account for the significance of these differences under \xc2\xa72.  In these cases the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings regarding the different characteristics, needs, and interests of the Latino community near the Mexican border and the one in and around Austin are well supported and uncontested.  Legitimate yet differing communities of interest should not be disregarded in the interest of race.  The practical consequence of drawing a district to cover two distant, disparate communities is that one or both groups will be unable to achieve their political goals.  Compactness is, therefore, about more than \xe2\x80\x9cstyle points,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 3 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.); it is critical to advancing the ultimate purposes of \xc2\xa72, ensuring minority groups equal \xe2\x80\x9copportunity \xe2\x80\xa6 to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b).  (And if it were just about style points, it is difficult to understand why a plaintiff would have to propose a compact district to make out a \xc2\xa72 claim.)  As witnesses who know the south and west Texas culture and politics testified, the districting in Plan 1374C \xe2\x80\x9ccould make it more difficult for thinly financed Latino-preferred candidates to achieve electoral success and to provide adequate and responsive representation once elected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 502; see also <em>id.,</em> at 503 (Elected officials from the region \xe2\x80\x9ctestified that the size and diversity of the newly-configured districts could make it more difficult for the constituents in the Rio Grande Valley to control election outcomes\xe2\x80\x9d).  We do not question the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the groups\xe2\x80\x99 combined voting strength would enable them to elect a candidate each prefers to the Anglos\xe2\x80\x99 candidate of choice.  We also accept that in some cases members of a racial group in different areas\xe2\x80\x94for example, rural and urban communities\xe2\x80\x94could share similar interests and therefore form a compact district if the areas are in reasonably close proximity.  See <em>Abrams, supra</em>, at 111\xe2\x80\x93112 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  When, however, the only common index is race and the result will be to cause internal friction, the State cannot make this a remedy for a \xc2\xa72 violation elsewhere.  We emphasize it is the enormous geographical distance separating the Austin and Mexican-border communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populations\xe2\x80\x94not either factor alone\xe2\x80\x94that renders District 25 noncompact for \xc2\xa72 purposes.  The mathematical possibility of a racial bloc does not make a district compact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since District 25 is not reasonably compact, Plan 1374C contains only five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts.  Plan 1151C, by contrast, created six such districts.  The District Court did not find, and the State does not contend, that any of the Latino opportunity districts in Plan 1151C are noncompact.  Contrary to The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>post,</em> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, moreover, the Latino population in old District 23 is, for the most part, in closer geographic proximity than is the Latino population in new District 25.  More importantly, there has been no contention that different pockets of the Latino population in old District 23 have divergent needs and interests, and it is clear that, as set out below, the Latino population of District 23 was split apart particularly because it was becoming so cohesive.  The Latinos in District 23 had found an efficacious political identity, while this would be an entirely new and difficult undertaking for the Latinos in District 25, given their geographic and other differences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants have thus satisfied all three <em>Gingles</em> requirements as to District 23, and the creation of new District 25 does not remedy the problem.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We proceed now to the totality of the circumstances, and first to the proportionality inquiry, comparing the percentage of total districts that are Latino opportunity districts with the Latino share of the citizen voting-age population.  As explained in <em>De Grandy</em>, proportionality is \xe2\x80\x9ca relevant fact in the totality of circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> </em>512 U. S., at 1000.  It does not, however, act as a \xe2\x80\x9csafe harbor\xe2\x80\x9d for States in complying with \xc2\xa72.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1017\xe2\x80\x931018; see also <em>id.,</em> at 1025 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (proportionality \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>always</em> relevant evidence in determining vote dilution, but is <em>never</em> itself dispositive\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 1027\xe2\x80\x931028 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (proportionality has \xe2\x80\x9csome relevance,\xe2\x80\x9d though \xe2\x80\x9cplacing undue emphasis upon proportionality risks defeating the goals underlying the Voting Rights Act\xe2\x80\x9d).  If proportionality could act as a safe harbor, it would ratify \xe2\x80\x9can unexplored premise of highly suspect validity: that in any given voting jurisdiction . . . , the rights of some minority voters under \xc2\xa72 may be traded off against the rights of other members of the same minority class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1019; see also <em>Shaw II, </em>517 U.

The District Court, moreover, expressly considered the statewide proportionality argument.  As a result, the question of the proper geographic scope for assessing proportionality now presents itself.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude the answer in these cases is to look at proportionality statewide.  The State contends that the seven districts in south and west Texas correctly delimit the boundaries for proportionality because that is the only area of the State where reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts can be drawn.  This argument, however, misunderstands the role of proportionality.  We have already determined, under the first <em>Gingles </em>factor, that another reasonably compact Latino district can be drawn.  The question now is whether the absence of that additional district constitutes impermissible vote dilution.  This inquiry requires an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98intensely local appraisal\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the challenged district.  <em>Gingles, </em>478 U. S., at 79 (quoting <em>Rogers</em> v. <em>Lodge,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/index.html">458 U. S. 613</a>, 622 (1982)); see also <em>Gingles, supra,</em> at 101 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment).  A local appraisal is necessary because the right to an undiluted vote does not belong to the \xe2\x80\x9cminority as a group,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather to \xe2\x80\x9cits individual members.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Shaw II, supra</em>, at 917.  And a State may not trade off the rights of some members of a racial group against the rights of other members of that group.  See <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1019; <em>Shaw II, supra</em>, at 916\xe2\x80\x93918.  The question is therefore not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether line-drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post,</em> at 13 (opinion of Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J.), but whether line-drawing dilutes the voting strength of the Latinos in District 23.</f></p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The role of proportionality is not to displace this local appraisal or to allow the State to trade off the rights of some against the rights of others.  Instead, it provides some evidence of whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b).  For this purpose, the State\xe2\x80\x99s seven-district area is arbitrary.  It just as easily could have included six or eight districts.  Appellants have alleged statewide vote dilution based on a statewide plan, so the electoral opportunities of Latinos across the State can bear on whether the lack of electoral opportunity for Latinos in District 23 is a consequence of Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s redrawing of lines or simply a consequence of the inevitable \xe2\x80\x98win some, lose some\xe2\x80\x99 in a State with racial bloc voting.  Indeed, several of the other factors in the totality of circumstances have been characterized with reference to the State as a whole.  <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 44\xe2\x80\x9345 (listing Senate Report factors).  Particularly given the presence of racially polarized voting\xe2\x80\x94and the possible submergence of minority votes\xe2\x80\x94throughout Texas, it makes sense to use the entire State in assessing proportionality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Looking statewide, there are 32 congressional districts.  The five reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts amount to roughly 16% of the total, while Latinos make up 22% of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 citizen voting-age population.  (Appellant GI Forum claims, based on data from the 2004 American Community Survey of the U. S. Census Bureau, that Latinos constitute 24.5% of the statewide citizen voting-age population, but as this figure was neither available at the time of the redistricting, nor presented to the District Court, we accept the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding of 22%.)  Latinos are, therefore, two districts shy of proportional representation.  There is, of course, no \xe2\x80\x9cmagic parameter,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>De Grandy,</em> 512 U. S., at 1017, n.\xc2\xa014, and \xe2\x80\x9crough proportionality,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1023, must allow for some deviations.  We need not decide whether the two-district deficit in these cases weighs in favor of a \xc2\xa72 violation.  Even if Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s disproportionality were deemed insubstantial, that consideration would not overcome the other evidence of vote dilution for Latinos in District 23.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he degree of probative value assigned to proportionality may vary with other facts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 1020, and the other facts in these cases convince us that there is a \xc2\xa72 violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0District 23\xe2\x80\x99s Latino voters were poised to elect their candidate of choice.  They were becoming more politically active, with a marked and continuous rise in Spanish-surnamed voter registration.  See Lichtman Report, App. 142\xe2\x80\x93143.  In successive elections Latinos were voting against Bonilla in greater numbers, and in 2002 they almost ousted him.  Webb County in particular, with a 94% Latino population, spurred the incumbent\xe2\x80\x99s near defeat with dramatically increased turnout in 2002.  See 2004 Almanac 1579.  In response to the growing participation that threatened Bonilla\xe2\x80\x99s incumbency, the State divided the cohesive Latino community in Webb County, moving about 100,000 Latinos to District 28, which was already a Latino opportunity district, and leaving the rest in a district where they now have little hope of electing their candidate of choice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The changes to District 23 undermined the progress of a racial group that has been subject to significant voting-related discrimination and that was becoming increasingly politically active and cohesive.  Cf. <em>De Grandy, supra</em>, at 1014 (finding no \xc2\xa72 violation where \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s scheme would thwart the historical tendency to exclude Hispanics, not encourage or perpetuate it\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>White</em> v. <em>Regester,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/index.html">412 U. S. 755</a>, 769 (1973) (looking in the totality of the circumstances to whether the proposed districting would \xe2\x80\x9cremedy the effects of past and present discrimination against Mexican-Americans, and to bring the community into the full stream of political life of the county and State by encouraging their further registration, voting, and other political activities\xe2\x80\x9d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)).  The District Court recognized \xe2\x80\x9cthe long history of discrimination against Latinos and Blacks in Texas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 473, and other courts have elaborated on this history with respect to electoral processes:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cTexas has a long, well-documented history of discrimination that has touched upon the rights of African-Americans and Hispanics to register, to vote, or to participate otherwise in the electoral process.  Devices such as the poll tax, an all-white primary system, and restrictive voter registration time periods are an unfortunate part of this State\xe2\x80\x99s minority voting rights history.  The history of official discrimination in the Texas election process\xe2\x80\x94stretching back to Reconstruction\xe2\x80\x94led to the inclusion of the State as a covered jurisdiction under Section 5 in the 1975 amendments to the Voting Rights Act.  Since Texas became a covered jurisdiction, the Department of Justice has frequently interposed objections against the State and its subdivisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vera</em> v. <em>Richards, </em>861 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1304, 1317 (SD Tex. 1994) (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSee also <em>Vera, </em>517 U. S., at 981\xe2\x80\x93982; <em>Regester, supra</em>, at 767\xe2\x80\x93769.  In addition, the \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical, social, and economic legacy of past discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d for Latinos in Texas, <em>Session, supra</em>, at 492, may well \xe2\x80\x9chinder their ability to participate effectively in the political process,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gingles,</em> 478 U. S., at 45 (citing Senate Report factors).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Against this background, the Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 diminishing electoral support for Bonilla indicates their belief he was \xe2\x80\x9cunresponsive to the particularized needs of the members of the minority group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (same).  In essence the State took away the Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 opportunity because Latinos were about to exercise it.  This bears the mark of intentional discrimination that could give rise to an equal protection violation.  Even if we accept the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s action was taken primarily for political, not racial, reasons, <em>Session, supra</em>, at 508, the redrawing of the district lines was damaging to the Latinos in District 23.  The State not only made fruitless the Latinos\xe2\x80\x99 mobilization efforts but also acted against those Latinos who were becoming most politically active, dividing them with a district line through the middle of Laredo.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the reason for taking Latinos out of District 23, according to the District Court, was to protect Congressman Bonilla from a constituency that was increasingly voting against him.  The Court has noted that incumbency protection can be a legitimate factor in districting, see <em>Karcher</em> v. <em>Daggett</em>, 462 U. S., at 740, but experience teaches that incumbency protection can take various forms, not all of them in the interests of the constituents.  If the justification for incumbency protection is to keep the constituency intact so the officeholder is accountable for promises made or broken, then the protection seems to accord with concern for the voters.  If, on the other hand, incumbency protection means excluding some voters from the district simply because they are likely to vote against the officeholder, the change is to benefit the officeholder, not the voters.  By purposely redrawing lines around those who opposed Bonilla, the state legislature took the latter course.  This policy, whatever its validity in the realm of politics, cannot justify the effect on Latino voters.  See <em>Gingles, supra</em>, at 45 (citing Senate Report factor of whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe policy underlying\xe2\x80\x9d the State\xe2\x80\x99s action \xe2\x80\x9cis tenuous\xe2\x80\x9d).  The policy becomes even more suspect when considered in light of evidence suggesting that the State intentionally drew District 23 to have a nominal Latino voting-age majority (without a citizen voting-age majority) for political reasons.  <em>Session, supra</em>, at 497.  This use of race to create the fa\xc3\xa7ade of a Latino district also weighs in favor of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claim. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that we are reducing the State\xe2\x80\x99s needed flexibility in complying with \xc2\xa72, see <em>post,</em> at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, the problem here is entirely of the State\xe2\x80\x99s own making.  The State chose to break apart a Latino opportunity district to protect the incumbent congressman from the growing dissatisfaction of the cohesive and politically active Latino community in the district.  The State then purported to compensate for this harm by creating an entirely new district that combined two groups of Latinos, hundreds of miles apart, that represent different communities of interest.  Under \xc2\xa72, the State must be held accountable for the effect of these choices in denying equal opportunity to Latino voters.  Notwithstanding these facts, The Chief Justice places great emphasis on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s statement that \xe2\x80\x9cnew District 25 is \xe2\x80\x98a more effective Latino opportunity district than Congressional District 23 had been.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (quoting <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 503).  Even assuming this statement, expressed in the context of summarizing witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, qualifies as a finding of the District Court, two points make it of minimal relevance.  First, as previously noted, the District Court measured the effectiveness of District 25 without accounting for the detrimental consequences of its compactness problems.  Second, the District Court referred only to how effective District 23 \xe2\x80\x9chad been,\xe2\x80\x9d not to how it would operate today, a significant distinction given the growing Latino political power in the district.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the foregoing, the totality of the circumstances demonstrates a \xc2\xa72 violation.  Even assuming Plan 1374C provides something close to proportional representation for Latinos, its troubling blend of politics and race\xe2\x80\x94and the resulting vote dilution of a group that was beginning to achieve \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x99s goal of overcoming prior electoral discrimination\xe2\x80\x94cannot be sustained.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because we hold Plan 1374C violates \xc2\xa72 in its redrawing of District 23, we do not address appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims that the use of race and politics in drawing that district violates the First Amendment and equal protection.  We also need not confront appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claim of an equal protection violation in the drawing of District 25.  The districts in south and west Texas will have to be redrawn to remedy the violation in District 23, and we have no cause to pass on the legitimacy of a district that must be changed.  See <em>Session, supra</em>, at 528 (Ward, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  District 25, in particular, was formed to compensate for the loss of District 23 as a Latino opportunity district, and there is no reason to believe District 25 will remain in its current form once District 23 is brought into compliance with \xc2\xa72.  We therefore vacate the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment as to these claims.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants also challenge the changes to district lines in the Dallas area, alleging they dilute African-American voting strength in violation of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.  Specifically, appellants contend that an African-American minority effectively controlled District 24 under Plan 1151C, and that \xc2\xa72 entitles them to this district.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before Plan 1374C was enacted, District 24 had elected Anglo Democrat Martin Frost to Congress in every election since 1978.  <em>Session, supra</em>, at 481\xe2\x80\x93482.  Anglos were the largest racial group in the district, with 49.8% of the citizen voting-age population, and third largest were Latinos, with 20.8%.  State\xe2\x80\x99s Exh. 57, App. 339.  African-Americans were the second-largest group, with 25.7% of the citizen voting-age population, <em>ibid.,</em> and they voted consistently for Frost.  The new plan broke apart this racially diverse district, assigning its pieces into several other districts.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accepting that African-Americans would not be a majority of the single-member district they seek, and that African-Americans do not vote cohesively with Hispanics, <em>Session, supra</em>, at 484, appellants nonetheless contend African-Americans had effective control of District 24.  As the Court has done several times before, we assume for purposes of this litigation that it is possible to state a \xc2\xa72 claim for a racial group that makes up less than 50% of the population.  See <em>De Grandy, </em>512 U. S., at 1009; <em>Voinovich</em> v. <em>Quilter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/146/index.html">507 U. S. 146</a>, 154 (1993); <em>Gingles,</em> 478 U. S., at 46\xe2\x80\x9347, n.\xc2\xa012.  Even on the assumption that the first <em>Gingles</em> prong can accommodate this claim, however, appellants must show they constitute \xe2\x80\x9ca sufficiently large minority to elect their candidate of choice with the assistance of cross-over votes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Voinovich, supra</em>, at 158 (emphasis omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The relatively small African-American population can meet this standard, according to appellants, because they constituted 64% of the voters in the Democratic primary.  Since a significant number of Anglos and Latinos voted for the Democrat in the general election, the argument goes, African-American control of the primary translated into effective control of the entire election.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court found, however, that African-Americans could not elect their candidate of choice in the primary.  In support of this finding, it relied on testimony that the district was drawn for an Anglo Democrat, the fact that Frost had no opposition in any of his primary elections since his incumbency began, and District 24\xe2\x80\x99s demographic similarity to another district where an African-American candidate failed when he ran against an Anglo.  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 483\xe2\x80\x93484.  \xe2\x80\x9cIn short, that Anglo Democrats control this district is,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the District Court, \xe2\x80\x9cthe most rational conclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 484.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants fail to demonstrate clear error in this finding.  In the absence of any contested Democratic primary in District 24 over the last 20 years, no obvious benchmark exists for deciding whether African-Americans could elect their candidate of choice.  The fact that African-Americans voted for Frost\xe2\x80\x94in the primary and general elections\xe2\x80\x94could signify he is their candidate of choice.  Without a contested primary, however, it could also be interpreted to show (assuming racial bloc voting) that Anglos and Latinos would vote in the Democratic primary in greater numbers if an African-American candidate of choice were to run, especially given Texas\xe2\x80\x99 open primary system.  The District Court heard trial testimony that would support both explanations, and we cannot say that it erred in crediting the testimony that endorsed the latter interpretation.  Compare App. 242\xe2\x80\x93243 (testimony of Tarrant County Precinct Administrator that Frost is the \xe2\x80\x9cfavored candidate of the African-American community\xe2\x80\x9d and that he has gone unopposed in primary challenges because he \xe2\x80\x9cserves [the African-American community\xe2\x80\x99s] interests\xe2\x80\x9d), with<em> id.,</em> at 262\xe2\x80\x93264 (testimony of Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson that District 24 was drawn for an Anglo Democrat (Martin Frost, in particular) in 1991 by splitting a minority community), and <em>id.,</em> at 277\xe2\x80\x93280 (testimony of State Representative Ron Wilson that African-Americans did not have the ability to elect their preferred candidate, particularly an African-American candidate, in District 24 and that Anglo Democrats in such \xe2\x80\x9cinfluence [d]istricts\xe2\x80\x9d were not fully responsive to the needs of the African-American community).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The analysis submitted by appellants\xe2\x80\x99 own expert was also inconsistent.  Of the three elections for statewide office he examined, in District 24 the African-American candidate of choice would have won one, lost one, and in the third the African-American vote was split.  See Lichtman Report, <em>id.,</em> at 75\xe2\x80\x9376, 92\xe2\x80\x9396; State\xe2\x80\x99s Exh. 20 in Civ. Action No. 2:03\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93354 (ED Tex.), p. 138; State\xe2\x80\x99s Exh. 21 in Civ. Action No. 2:03\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93354 (ED Tex.).  The District Court committed no clear error in rejecting this questionable showing that African-Americans have the ability to elect their candidate of choice in favor of other evidence that an African-American candidate of choice would not prevail.  See <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Bessemer City,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/index.html">470 U. S. 564</a>, 574 (1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere there are two permissible views of the evidence, the factfinder\xe2\x80\x99s choice between them cannot be clearly erroneous\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That African-Americans had influence in the district, <em>Session, supra</em>, at 485, does not suffice to state a \xc2\xa72 claim in these cases.  The opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of their choice,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b), requires more than the ability to influence the outcome between some candidates, none of whom is their candidate of choice.  There is no doubt African-Americans preferred Martin Frost to the Republicans who opposed him.  The fact that African-Americans preferred Frost to some others does not, however, make him their candidate of choice.  Accordingly, the ability to aid in Frost\xe2\x80\x99s election does not make the old District 24 an African-American opportunity district for purposes of \xc2\xa72.  If \xc2\xa72 were interpreted to protect this kind of influence, it would unnecessarily infuse race into virtually every redistricting, raising serious constitutional questions.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> 539 U. S., at 491 (Kennedy, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants respond by pointing to <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft, </em>where the Court held that the presence of influence districts is a relevant consideration under \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act.  The inquiry under \xc2\xa72, however, concerns the opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of their choice,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b), not whether a change has the purpose or effect of \xe2\x80\x9cdenying or abridging the right to vote,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71973c.  <em>Ashcroft</em> recognized the differences between these tests, 539 U. S., at 478, and concluded that the ability of racial groups to elect candidates of their choice is only one factor under \xc2\xa75, <em>id.,</em> at 480.  So while the presence of districts \xe2\x80\x9cwhere minority voters may not be able to elect a candidate of choice but can play a substantial, if not decisive, role in the electoral process\xe2\x80\x9d is relevant to the \xc2\xa75 analysis, <em>id.,</em> at 482, the lack of such districts cannot establish a \xc2\xa72 violation.  The failure to create an influence district in these cases thus does not run afoul of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act. \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants do not raise a district-specific political gerrymandering claim against District 24.  Even if the claim were cognizable as part of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 statewide challenge, it would be unpersuasive.  Just as for the statewide claim, appellants would lack any reliable measure of partisan fairness.  Justice Stevens suggests the burden on representational rights can be measured by comparing the success of Democrats in old District 24 with their success in the new districts they now occupy.  <em>Post,</em> at 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  There is no reason, however, why the old district has any special claim to fairness.  In fact, old District 24, no less than the old redistricting plan as a whole, was formed for partisan reasons.  See <em>Session,</em> 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 484; see also <em>Balderas</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, Civ.

Applying such standards, I shall explain why the wholly unnecessary replacement of the neutral plan fashioned by the three-judge court in <em>Balderas </em>v. <em>Texas,</em> Civ. Action No. 6:01CV158 (ED Tex., Nov. 14, 2001) (Plan 1151C or<em> Balderas </em>Plan) with Plan 1374C, which creates districts with less compact shapes, violates the Voting Rights Act, and fragments communities of interest\xe2\x80\x94all for purely partisan purposes\xe2\x80\x94violated the State\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional duty to govern impartially.  Prior misconduct by the Texas Legislature neither excuses nor justifies that violation.  Accordingly, while I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to invalidate District 23, I would hold that Plan 1374C is entirely invalid and direct the District Court to reinstate Plan 1151C.  Moreover, as I shall explain, even if the remainder of the plan were valid, the cracking of <em>Balderas</em> District 24 would still be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The maintenance of existing district boundaries is advantageous to both voters and candidates.  Changes, of course, must be made after every census to equalize the population of each district or to accommodate changes in the size of a State\xe2\x80\x99s congressional delegation.  Similarly, changes must be made in response to a finding that a districting plan violates \xc2\xa72 or \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973, 1973c.  But the interests in orderly campaigning and voting, as well as in maintaining communication between representatives and their constituents, underscore the importance of requiring that any decision to redraw district boundaries\xe2\x80\x94like any other state action that affects the electoral process\xe2\x80\x94must, at the very least, serve some legitimate governmental purpose.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Burdick</em> v. <em>Takushi,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/428/index.html">504 U. S. 428</a>, 434, 440 (1992); <em>id.</em>, at 448\xe2\x80\x93450 (Kennedy, J., joined by Blackmun and Stevens, JJ., dissenting).  A purely partisan desire \xe2\x80\x9cto minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial or political elements of the voting population,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fortson</em> v. <em>Dorsey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/433/index.html">379 U. S. 433</a>, 439 (1965), is not such a purpose.  Because a desire to minimize the strength of Texas Democrats was the sole motivation for the adoption of Plan 1374C, see <em>Session </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 451, 470, 472 (ED Tex. 2004) <em>(per curiam),</em> the plan cannot withstand constitutional scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The districting map that Plan 1374C replaced, Plan 1151C, was not only manifestly fair and neutral, it may legitimately be described as a milestone in Texas\xe2\x80\x99 political history because it put an end to a long history of Democratic misuse of power in that State.  For decades after the Civil War, the political party associated with the former Commander in Chief of the Union Army attracted the support of former slaves and a handful of \xe2\x80\x9ccarpetbaggers,\xe2\x80\x9d but had no significant political influence in Texas.  The Democrats maintained their political power by excluding black voters from participating in primary elections, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Allwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/649/index.html">321 U. S. 649</a>, 656\xe2\x80\x93661 (1944), by the artful management of multimember electoral schemes, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>White</em> v. <em>Regester,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/755/index.html">412 U. S. 755</a>, 765\xe2\x80\x93770 (1973)<em>, </em>and, most recently, by outrageously partisan gerrymandering, see <em>ante</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934 (opinion of Kennedy, J.); <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html">517 U.

Unfortunately, some of these tactics are not unique to Texas Democrats; the apportionment scheme they devised in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s is only one example of the excessively gerrymandered districting plans that parties with control of their States\xe2\x80\x99 governing bodies have implemented in recent years.

If, after finally achieving political strength in Texas, the Republicans had adopted a new plan in order to remove the excessively partisan Democratic gerrymander of the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, the decision to do so would unquestionably have been supported by a neutral justification.  But that is not what happened.  Instead, as the following discussion of the relevant events that transpired in Texas following the release of the 2000 census data demonstrates, Texas Republicans abandoned a neutral apportionment map for the sole purpose of manipulating district boundaries to maximize their electoral advantage and thus create their own impermissible stranglehold on political power.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By 2001, Texas Republicans had overcome many of the aforementioned tactics designed to freeze the Democrats\xe2\x80\x99 status as the State\xe2\x80\x99s dominant party, and Republicans controlled the governorship and the State Senate.  Democrats, however, continued to constitute a majority of the State House of Representatives.  In March of that year, the results of the 2000 decennial census revealed that, as a result of its population growth, Texas was entitled to two additional seats in the United States House of Representatives, bringing the size of the Texas congressional delegation to 32.  Texas, therefore, was required to draw 32 equipopulous districts to account for its additional representation and to comply with the one-person, one-vote mandate of Article I, \xc2\xa72, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Karcher,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/725/index.html"></a><a href="/us/462/725/index.html">462 U. S. 725</a>.  Under Texas law, the Texas Legislature was required to draw these new districts.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 457\xe2\x80\x93458.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Texas Legislature, divided between a Republican Senate and a Democratic House, did not reach agreement on a new congressional map in the regular legislative session, and Governor Rick Perry declined to call a special session.  Litigation in the Texas state courts also failed to result in a plan, as the Texas Supreme Court vacated the map created by a state trial judge.  See <em>Perry </em>v. <em>Del Rio</em>, 67 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 85 (2001).  This left a three-judge Federal District Court in the Eastern District of Texas with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the unwelcome obligation of performing in the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s stead.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Balderas </em>v. <em>Texas</em>, Civ.

(quoting <em>Henderson </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 756, 768 (ED Tex. 2005)).  As the court explained, it started with a blank map of Texas, drew in the existing districts protected by the Voting Rights Act, located the new Districts 31 and 32 where the population growth that produced them had occurred, and then applied the neutral criteria of \xe2\x80\x9ccompactness, contiguity, and respecting county and municipal boundaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Juris. Statement 205a.  See <em>id.</em>, at 206a\xe2\x80\x93209a.  The District Court purposely \xe2\x80\x9ceschewed an effort to treat old lines as an independent locator,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that its plan had done much \xe2\x80\x9cto end most of the below-the-surface \xe2\x80\x98ripples\xe2\x80\x99 of the 1991 plan and the myriad of submissions before us.  For example, the patently irrational shapes of Districts 5 and 6 under the 1991 plan, widely-cited as the most extreme but successful gerrymandering in the country, are no more.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 207a\xe2\x80\x93208a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the conclusion of this process, the court believed that it had fashioned a map that was \xe2\x80\x9clikely to produce a congressional delegation roughly proportional to the party voting breakdown across the state.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 209a.  Indeed, reflecting the growing strength of the Republican Party, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s plan, Plan 1151C, offered that party an advantage in 20 of the 32 congressional seats.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 471 (describing Plan 1151C).<em> </em>The State\xe2\x80\x99s expert in this litigation testified that the <em>Balderas </em>Plan was not biased in favor of Democrats and that it was \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aybe slightly\xe2\x80\x9d biased in favor of Republicans.  App. 224 (deposition of Ronald Keith Gaddie, Ph.D.).  Although groups of Latino voters challenged Plan 1151C on appeal, neither major political party did so, and the State of Texas filed a motion asking this Court to affirm the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, which we did, see <em>Balderas </em>v. <em>Texas,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/919/index.html">536 U. S. 919</a> (2002).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 2002 congressional elections, however, Republicans were not able to capitalize on the advantage that the <em>Balderas </em>plan had provided them.  A number of Democratic incumbents were able to attract the votes of ticket-splitters (individuals who voted for candidates from one party in statewide elections and for a candidate from a different party in congressional elections), and thus won elections in some districts that favored Republicans.  As a result, Republicans carried only 15 of the districts drawn by the <em>Balderas</em> court.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the Republicans did not do as well as they had hoped in elections for the United States House of Representatives, they made gains in the Texas House of Representatives and won a majority of seats in that body.  This gave Texas Republicans control over both bodies of the state legislature, as well as the Governor\xe2\x80\x99s mansion, for the first time since Reconstruction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With full control of the State\xe2\x80\x99s legislative and executive branches, the Republicans \xe2\x80\x9cdecided to redraw the state\xe2\x80\x99s congressional districts solely for the purpose of seizing between five and seven seats from Democratic incumbents.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session</em>,<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 472 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  According to former Lieutenant Governor Bill Ratliff, a highly regarded Republican member of the State Senate, \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical gain for the Republicans was 110% of the motivation for the Plan, . . . it was \xe2\x80\x98the entire motivation.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 473 (quoting trial transcript).  Or, as the District Court stated in the first of its two decisions in this litigation, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here is little question but that the single-minded purpose of the Texas Legislature in enacting Plan 1374C was to gain partisan advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 470.  See also <em>ante</em>, at 5 (quoting District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion).  Indeed, as the State itself argued before the District Court: \xe2\x80\x9cThe overwhelming evidence demonstrated that partisan gain was the motivating force behind the decision to redistrict in 2003.\xe2\x80\x9d  State Defendants\xe2\x80\x99 Post-Trial Brief in No. 2:03\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93354 (ED Tex.), p. 51 (hereinafter State Post-Trial Brief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This desire for political gain led to a series of dramatic confrontations between Republicans and Democrats, and ultimately resulted in the adoption of a plan that violated the Voting Rights Act.  The legislature did not pass a new map in the regular 2003 session, in part because Democratic House members absented themselves and thus denied the body a quorum.  Governor Perry then called a special session to take up congressional redistricting\xe2\x80\x94the same step he had declined to take in 2001 after the release of the decennial census figures, when Republicans lacked a majority in the House.  During the first special session, the House approved a new congressional map, but the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s longstanding tradition requiring two-thirds of that body to support a measure before the full Senate will consider it allowed Democrats to block the plan.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lieutenant Governor Dewhurst then announced that he would suspend operation of the two-thirds rule in any future special session considering congressional redistricting.  Nonetheless, in a second special session, Senate Democrats again prevented the passage of a new districting map by leaving the State and depriving the Senate of a quorum.  When a lone Senate Democrat returned to Texas, Governor Perry called a third special session to consider congressional redistricting.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During that third special session, the State Senate and the State House passed maps that would have apparently avoided any violation of the Voting Rights Act, because they would have, <em>inter alia</em>, essentially preserved <em>Balderas</em> District 23, a majority-Latino district in southwest Texas, and <em>Balderas</em> District 24, a majority-minority district in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, where black voters constituted a significant majority of voters in the Democratic primary and usually elected their candidate of choice in the general election.  Representative Phil King, the redistricting legislation\xe2\x80\x99s chief sponsor in the Texas House, had previously proposed fragmenting District 24, but, after lawyers reviewed the map, King expressed concern that redrawing District 24 might violate the Voting Rights Act, and he drafted a new map that left District 24 largely unchanged.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, the conferees seeking to reconcile the House and Senate plans produced a map that, as part of its goal of maximizing Republican political advantage, significantly altered both Districts 23 and 24 as they had existed in the <em>Balderas </em>Plan.  <em>Balderas </em>District 23 was extended north to take in roughly 100,000 new people who were predominately Anglo and Republican, and was also moved west, thus splitting Webb County and the City of Laredo, and pushing roughly 100,000 people who were predominately Latino and Democratic into an adjacent district.  <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.  Black voters who previously resided in <em>Balderas </em>District 24 were fragmented into five new districts, each of which is predominately Anglo and Republican.  See App. 104\xe2\x80\x93106.  Representative King testified at trial that District 24 was cracked even though cracking the district was not \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the path of least resistance\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in terms of avoiding Voting Rights Act liability, because leaving <em>Balderas </em>District 24 intact would not \xe2\x80\x9caccomplish our political objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  State Post-Trial Brief 51\xe2\x80\x9352 (quoting transcript).  This map was ultimately enacted into law as Plan 1374C.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The overall effect of Plan 1374C was to shift more than <em>eight million</em> Texans into new districts, and to split more counties into more pieces than the <em>Balderas </em>Plan.  Moreover, the 32 districts in Plan 1374C are, on average, much less compact under either of two standard measures than their counterparts had been under the <em>Balderas </em>Plan.  See App. 177\xe2\x80\x93178 (expert report of Professor Gaddie).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Numerous parties filed suit in federal court challenging Plan 1374C on the grounds that it violated \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act and that it constituted an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  A three-judge panel\xe2\x80\x94two of whom also were members of the <em>Balderas </em>court\xe2\x80\x94rejected these challenges, over Judge Ward\xe2\x80\x99s partial dissent on the \xc2\xa72 claims.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 451.  Responding to plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 appeals, we remanded for reconsideration in light of <em>Vieth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html">541 U. S. 267</a>.  See <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/941/index.html">543 U. S. 941</a> (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a characteristically thoughtful opinion written by Judge Higginbotham, the District Court again rejected all challenges to the constitutionality of Plan 1374C.  See <em>Henderson</em>, 399 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 756.  It correctly found that the Constitution does not prohibit a state legislature from redrawing congressional districts in the middle of a census cycle, see <em>id.</em>, at 766, and it also correctly recognized that this Court has not yet endorsed clear standards for judging the validity of partisan gerrymanders, see <em>id.</em>, at 760\xe2\x80\x93762.  Because the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s original decision, and its reconsideration of the case in the light of the several opinions in <em>Vieth </em>v. <em>Jubelirer</em>, are successive chapters in the saga that began with <em>Balderas</em>, it is appropriate to quote this final comment from that opinion before addressing the principal question that is now presented.  The <em>Balderas</em> court concluded:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cFinally, to state directly what is implicit in all that we have said: political gerrymandering, a purely partisan exercise, is inappropriate for a federal court drawing a congressional redistricting map.  Even at the hands of a legislative body, political gerrymandering is much a bloodfeud, in which revenge is exacted by the majority against its rival.  We have left it to the political arena, as we must and wisely should.  We do so because our role is limited and not because we see gerrymandering as other than what it is: an abuse of power that, at its core, evinces a fundamental distrust of voters, serving the self-interest of the political parties at the expense of the public good.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Juris. Statement 209a\xe2\x80\x93210a (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unique question of law that is raised in this appeal is one that the Court has not previously addressed.  That narrow question is whether it was unconstitutional for Texas to replace a lawful districting plan \xe2\x80\x9cin the middle of a decade, for the sole purpose of maximizing partisan advantage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Juris. Statement in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93276, p. i.  This question is both different from, and simpler than, the principal question presented in<em> Vieth </em>v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> in which the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d prevented the plurality from deciding the merits of a statewide challenge to a political gerrymander.  541 U.

In defense of the map itself, rather than the basic decision whether to draw the map in the first place, the State notes that Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s district borders frequently follow county lines and other neutral criteria.  At what the State describes as the relevant \xe2\x80\x9clevel of granularity,\xe2\x80\x9d the State correctly points out that appellants have not even attempted to argue that every district line was motivated solely for partisan gain.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See also <em>ante</em>, at 11 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cpartisan aims did not guide every line\xe2\x80\x9d in Plan 1374C).  Indeed, the multitude of \xe2\x80\x9cgranular\xe2\x80\x9d decisions that are made during redistricting was part of why the <em>Vieth </em>plurality concluded, in the context of a statewide challenge to a redistricting plan promulgated in response to a legal obligation to redistrict, that there are no manageable standards to govern whether the predominant motivation underlying the entire redistricting map was partisan.  See 541 U. S., at 285.  But see <em>id.</em>, at 355 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (arguing that there are judicially manageable standards to assess statewide districting challenges even when a plan is enacted in response to a legal obligation to redistrict).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike <em>Vieth,</em> the narrow question presented by the statewide challenge in this litigation is whether the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to draw the map in the first place, when it was under no legal obligation to do so, was permissible.  It is undeniable that identifying the motive for making that basic decision is a readily manageable judicial task.  See <em>Gomillion</em> v. <em>Lightfoot,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/339/index.html">364 U. S. 339</a>, 341 (1960) (noting that plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 allegations, if true, would establish by circumstantial evidence \xe2\x80\x9ctantamount for all practical purposes to a mathematical demonstration,\xe2\x80\x9d that redistricting legislation had been enacted \xe2\x80\x9csolely\xe2\x80\x9d to segregate voters along racial lines); cf. <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U. S. 256</a>, 276\xe2\x80\x93280 (1979) (analyzing whether the purpose of a law was to discriminate against women).  Indeed, although the Constitution places no <em>per se </em>ban on midcycle redistricting, a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to redistrict in the middle of the census cycle, when the legislature is under no legal obligation to do so, makes the judicial task of identifying the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s motive simpler than it would otherwise be.  As Justice Breyer<font b="1" scaps="1"> has pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cthe presence of midcycle redistricting, for any reason, raises a fair inference that partisan machinations played a major role in the map-drawing process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 367 (dissenting opinion).</font></p><font b="1" scaps="1">\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that courts can easily identify the motive for redistricting when the legislature is under no legal obligation to act is reinforced by the record in this very case.  The District Court unambiguously identified the sole purpose behind the decision to promulgate Plan 1374C: a desire to maximize partisan advantage.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 472 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt was clear from the evidence\xe2\x80\x9d that Republicans \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98decided to redraw the state\xe2\x80\x99s congressional districts solely for the purpose of seizing between five and seven seats from Democratic incumbents\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>amicus</em> brief filed in <em>Vieth </em>v. <em>Jubelirer</em>); 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp., at 470 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is little question but that the single-minded purpose of the Texas Legislature in enacting Plan 1374C was to gain partisan advantage\xe2\x80\x9d).  It does not matter whether the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of that purpose qualifies as a specific finding of fact because it is perfectly clear that there is more than ample evidence in the record to support such a finding.  This evidence includes: (1) testimony from state legislators; (2) the procedural irregularities described above that accompanied the adoption of Plan 1374C, including the targeted abolition of the longstanding two-thirds rule, designed to protect the rights of the minority party, in the Texas Senate; (3) Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x99s significant departures from the neutral districting criteria of compactness and respect for county lines; (4) the plan\xe2\x80\x99s excessive deviations from prior districts, which interfere with the development of strong relationships between Members of Congress and their constituents; and (5) the plan\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the Voting Rights Act.  Indeed, the State itself conceded that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he overwhelming evidence demonstrated that partisan gain was the motivating force behind the decision to redistrict in 2003.\xe2\x80\x9d  State Post-Trial Brief 51.  In my judgment, there is not even a colorable basis for contending that the relevant intent\xe2\x80\x94in this case a purely partisan intent[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]\xe2\x80\x94cannot be identified on the basis of admissible evidence in the\nrecord.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the conclusions that courts are fully capable of analyzing the intent behind a decision to redistrict, and that desire for partisan gain was the sole factor motivating the decision to redistrict at issue here, do not resolve the question whether proof of a single-minded partisan intent is sufficient to establish a constitutional violation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the merits of that question, the State seems to assume that our decision in <em>Upham</em> v. <em>Seamon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/37/index.html">456 U. S. 37</a> (1982) <em>(per curiam), </em>has already established the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s right to replace a court-ordered plan with a plan drawn for purely partisan purposes.  Justice Kennedy ultimately indulges in a similar assumption, relying on <em>Upham</em> for the proposition that \xe2\x80\x9cour decisions have assumed that state legislatures are free to replace court-mandated remedial plans by enacting redistricting plans of their own.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Justice Kennedy recognizes that \xe2\x80\x9c[j]udicial respect for legislative plans, however, cannot justify legislative reliance on improper criteria for districting determinations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  But Justice Kennedy then incorrectly concludes that the singular intent to maximize partisan advantage is not, in itself, such an improper criterion.   <em>Ante,</em> at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This reliance on <em>Upham</em> overlooks critical distinctions between the redistricting plan the District Court drew in <em>Upham</em> and the redistricting plan the District Court drew in <em>Balderas</em>.  The judicial plan in <em>Upham </em>was created to provide an interim response to an objection by the Attorney General that two contiguous districts in a plan originally drafted by the Texas Legislature violated \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act.  We concluded that, in fashioning its interim remedy, the District Court had erroneously \xe2\x80\x9csubstituted its own reapportionment preferences for those of the state legislature.\xe2\x80\x9d  456 U. S., at 40.  We held that when judicial relief was necessary because a state legislature had failed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to reapportion according to federal constitutional [or statutory] requisites in a timely fashion after having had an adequate opportunity to do so,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the federal court should, as much as possible \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98follow the policies and preferences of the State,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in creating a new map.  <em>Id.</em>, at 41 (quoting <em>White</em> v. <em>Weiser,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/783/index.html">412 U. S. 783</a>, 794\xe2\x80\x93795 (1973)).  We did not suggest that federal courts should honor partisan concerns, but rather identified the relevant state policies as those \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98expressed in statutory and constitutional provisions or in the reapportionment plans proposed by the state legislature, whenever adherence to state policy does not detract from the requirements of the Federal Constitution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Upham, </em>456 U. S., at 41 (quoting <em>White</em>, 412 U. S., at 794\xe2\x80\x93795).  Because the District Court in <em>Upham</em> had exceeded its authority in drawing a new districting map, we made clear that the legislature was authorized to remedy the \xc2\xa75 violation with a map of its own choosing.  See 456 U. S., at 44.  <em>Upham</em>, then, stands only for the proposition that a state legislature is authorized to redraw a court-drawn congressional districting map when a district court has exceeded its remedial authority.  <em>Upham</em> does not stand for the proposition that, after a State embraces a valid, neutral court-drawn plan by asking this Court to affirm the opinion creating that plan, the State may then redistrict for the sole purpose of disadvantaging a minority political party.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, to conclude otherwise would reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the reason why we have held that state legislatures, rather than federal courts, should have the primary task of creating apportionment plans that comport with federal law.  We have so held because \xe2\x80\x9ca state legislature is the institution that is by far the best situated to identify and then reconcile traditional state policies\xe2\x80\x9d with the requirements of federal law, <em>Finch,</em> 431 U. S., at 414\xe2\x80\x93415, not because we wish to supply a dominant party with an opportunity to disadvantage its political opponents.  Indeed, a straightforward application of settled constitutional law leads to the inescapable conclusion that the State may not decide to redistrict if its sole motivation is \xe2\x80\x9cto minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial <em>or political</em> elements of the voting population,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fortson,</em> 379 U. S., at 439 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirements of the Federal Constitution that limit the State\xe2\x80\x99s power to rely exclusively on partisan preferences in drawing district lines are the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against invidious discrimination, and the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection of citizens from official retaliation based on their political affiliation.  The equal protection component of the Fourteenth Amendment requires actions taken by the sovereign to be supported by some legitimate interest, and further establishes that a bare desire to harm a politically disfavored group is not a legitimate interest.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cleburne</em> v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html">473 U. S. 432</a>, 447 (1985).  Similarly, the freedom of political belief and association guaranteed by the First Amendment prevents the State, absent a compelling interest, from \xe2\x80\x9cpenalizing citizens because of their participation in the electoral process, \xe2\x80\xa6 their association with a political party, or their expression of political views.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 314 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment) (citing <em>Elrod </em>v. <em>Burns</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/index.html">427 U. S. 347</a> (1976) (plurality opinion)).  These protections embodied in the First and Fourteenth Amendments reflect the fundamental duty of the sovereign to govern impartially.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Lehr</em> v. <em>Robertson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/248/index.html">463 U. S. 248</a>, 265 (1983); <em>New York City Transit Authority</em> v. <em>Beazer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/568/index.html">440 U.

By taking an action for the sole purpose of advantaging Republicans and disadvantaging Democrats, the State of Texas violated its constitutional obligation to govern impartially.  \xe2\x80\x9cIf a State passed an enactment that declared \xe2\x80\x98All future apportionment shall be drawn so as most to burden Party X\xe2\x80\x99s rights to fair and effective representation, though still in accord with one-person, one-vote principles,\xe2\x80\x99 we would surely conclude the Constitution had been violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U.

This conclusion\xe2\x80\x94which clearly goes to the merits, rather than the manageability, of a partisan gerrymandering claim\xe2\x80\x94is not only inconsistent with the constitutional requirement that state action must be supported by a legitimate interest, but also provides an insufficient response to appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claim on the merits.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy argues that adopting \xe2\x80\x9cthe modified sole-intent test\xe2\x80\x9d could \xe2\x80\x9cencourage partisan excess at the outset of the decade, when a legislature redistricts pursuant to its decennial constitutional duty and is then immune from the charge of sole-motivation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  But this would be a problem of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own making.  As the decision in <em>Cox </em>v. <em>Larios</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/947/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/947/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/947/index.html"></a><a href="/us/542/947/index.html">542 U.

Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s concern about a heightened incentive to engage in such excessive partisan gerrymandering would be avoided if the Court were willing to enforce those standards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s additional requirement that there be proof that the gerrymander did in fact burden the complainants\xe2\x80\x99 representative rights is clearly satisfied by the record in this litigation.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s accurate exposition of the reasons why the changes to District 23 diluted the voting rights of Latinos who remain in that district simultaneously explains why those changes also disadvantaged Democratic voters and thus demonstrates that the effects of a political gerrymander can be evaluated pursuant to judicially manageable\nstandards.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my judgment the record amply supports the conclusion that Plan 1374C not only burdens the minority party in District 23, but also imposes a severe statewide burden on the ability of Democratic voters and politicians to influence the political process.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In arguing that Plan 1374C does not impose an unconstitutional burden on Democratic voters and candidates, the State takes the position that the plan has resulted in an equitable distribution of political power between the State\xe2\x80\x99s two principal political parties.  The State emphasizes that in the 2004 elections\xe2\x80\x94held pursuant to Plan 1374C\xe2\x80\x94Republicans won 21 of 32, or 66%, of the congressional seats.  That same year, Republicans carried 58% of the vote in statewide elections.  Admittedly, these numbers do suggest that the State\xe2\x80\x99s congressional delegation was \xe2\x80\x9croughly proportional\xe2\x80\x9d to the parties\xe2\x80\x99 share of the statewide vote, Brief for State Appellees 44, particularly in light of the fact that our electoral system tends to produce a \xe2\x80\x9cseat bonus\xe2\x80\x9d in which a party that wins a majority of the vote generally wins an even larger majority of the seats, see Brief for Alan Heslop et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> (describing the seat bonus phenomenon).  Cf. <em>ante</em>, at 12 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (arguing that, compared to the redistricting plan challenged in <em>Vieth</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cPlan 1374C can be seen as making the party balance more congruent to statewide party power\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That Plan 1374C produced a \xe2\x80\x9croughly proportional\xe2\x80\x9d congressional delegation in 2004 does not, however, answer the question whether the plan has a discriminatory effect against Democrats.  As appellants point out, whether a districting map is biased against a political party depends upon the bias in the map itself\xe2\x80\x94in other words, it depends upon the opportunities that the map offers each party, regardless of how candidates perform in a given year.  And, as the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert found in this litigation, Plan 1374C clearly has a discriminatory effect in terms of the opportunities it offers the two principal political parties in Texas.  Indeed, that discriminatory effect is severe.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0According to Professor Gaddie, the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, Plan 1374C gives Republicans an advantage in 22 of 32 congressional seats.  The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 expert, Professor Alford, who had been cited favorably by the <em>Balderas </em>Court as having applied a \xe2\x80\x9cneutral approach\xe2\x80\x9d to redistricting in that litigation, App. to Juris. Statement 207a, agreed.  He added that, in his view, the only surprise from the 2004 elections was \xe2\x80\x9chow far things moved\xe2\x80\x9d toward achieving a 22-to-10 pro-Republican split \xe2\x80\x9cin a single election year,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 226a (declaration of John R. Alford, Ph.D.).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  But this 22-to-10 advantage does not depend on Republicans winning the 58% share of the statewide vote that they received in 2004.  Instead, according to Professor Gaddie, Republicans would be likely to carry 22 of 32 congressional seats if they won only 52% of the statewide vote.  App. 216, 229.  Put differently, Plan 1374C ensures that, even if the Democratic Party succeeds in convincing 10% of the people who voted for Republicans in the last statewide elections to vote for Democratic congressional candidates,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] which would constitute a major electoral shift, there is unlikely to be <em>any</em> change in the number of congressional seats that Democrats win.  Moreover, Republicans would still have an overwhelming advantage if Democrats achieved full electoral parity.  According to Professor Gaddie\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, Republicans would be likely to carry 20 of the 32 congressional seats even if they only won 50% (or, for that matter, 49%) of the statewide vote.  <em>Id.</em>, at 216, 229\xe2\x80\x93230.  This demonstrates that Plan 1374C is inconsistent with the symmetry standard, a measure social scientists use to assess partisan bias, which is undoubtedly \xe2\x80\x9ca reliable standard\xe2\x80\x9d for measuring a \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 on the complainants\xe2\x80\x99 representative rights,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> ante</em>, at 11 (opinion of Kennedy, J.).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The symmetry standard \xe2\x80\x9crequires that the electoral system treat similarly-situated parties equally, so that each receives the same fraction of legislative seats for a particular vote percentage as the other party would receive if it had received the same percentage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Gary King et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae </em>4\xe2\x80\x935.  This standard is widely accepted by scholars as providing a measure of partisan fairness in electoral systems.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> </em>Tufte, The Relationship Between Seats and Votes in Two-Party Systems, 67 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 540, 542\xe2\x80\x93543 (1973); Gelman &amp; King, Enhancing Democracy Through Legislative Redistricting, 88 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 541, 545 (1994); Thompson, Election Time: Normative Implications of Temporal<em> </em>Properties of the Electoral Process in the United States, 98 Am. Pol. Sci. Rev. 51, 53, and n.\xc2\xa07 (2004); Engstrom &amp; Kernell, Manufactured Responsiveness: The Impact of State Electoral Laws on Unified Party Control of the Presidency and House of Representatives, 1840\xe2\x80\x931940, 49 Am. J. Pol. Sci. 531, 541 (2005).  Like other models that experts use in analyzing vote dilution claims, compliance with the symmetry standard is measured by extrapolating from a sample of known data, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Thornburg</em> v. <em>Gingles,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/30/index.html">478 U. S. 30</a>, 53 and n.\xc2\xa020 (1986) (discussing extreme case analysis and bivariate ecological regression analysis).  In this litigation, the symmetry standard was not simply proposed by an <em>amicus</em> to this Court, it was also used by the expert for plaintiffs and the expert for the State in assessing the degree of partisan bias in Plans 1151C and 1374C.  See App. 34\xe2\x80\x9342 (report of Professor Alford); <em>id.</em>, at 189\xe2\x80\x93193, 216 (report of Professor Gaddie).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because, as noted above, Republicans would have an advantage in a significant majority of seats even if the statewide vote were equally distributed between Republicans and Democrats, Plan 1374C constitutes a significant departure from the symmetry standard.  By contrast, based on Professor Gaddie\xe2\x80\x99s evaluation, the <em>Balderas</em> Plan, though slightly biased in favor of Republicans, provided markedly more equitable opportunities to Republicans and Democrats.  For example, consistent with the symmetry standard, under Plan 1151C the parties were likely to each take 16 congressional seats if they won 50% of the statewide vote.  See App. 216.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plan 1374C then, clearly has a discriminatory impact on the opportunities that Democratic citizens have to elect candidates of their choice.  Moreover, this discriminatory effect cannot be dismissed as <em>de minimis</em>.  According to the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, if each party receives half the statewide vote, under Plan 1374C the Republicans would carry 62.5% (20) of the congressional seats, whereas the Democrats would win 37.5% (12) of those seats.  In other words, at the vote distribution point where a politically neutral map would result in zero differential in the percentage of seats captured by each party, Plan 1374C is structured to create a 25% differential.  When a redistricting map imposes such a significant disadvantage on a politically salient group of voters, the State should shoulder the burden of defending the map.  Cf. <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Thomson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/835/index.html">462 U. S. 835</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93843 (1983) (holding that the implementation of a redistricting plan for state legislative districts with population deviations over 10% creates a prima facie case of discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause, thus shifting the burden to the State to defend the plan); <em>Larios </em>v. <em>Cox, </em>300 F.

S. 109</a>, 170 (1986) (Powell, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), the Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cthe power to influence the political process is not limited to winning elections,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 132 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 482 (2003).  In assessing whether members of a group whose candidate is defeated at the polls can nonetheless influence the elected representative, it is \xe2\x80\x9cimportant to consider \xe2\x80\x98the likelihood that candidates elected without decisive minority support would be willing to take the minority\xe2\x80\x99s interests into account.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 482 (quoting <em>Gingles,</em> 478 U. S., at 100 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment)).  One justification for majority rule is that elected officials <em>will</em> generally \xe2\x80\x9ctake the minority\xe2\x80\x99s interests into account,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because the majority recognizes that preferences shift and today\xe2\x80\x99s minority could be tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s majority.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, L. Guinier, Tyranny of the Majority 77 (1994); J. Ely, Democracy and Distrust 84 (1980); cf. Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson, (Oct. 24, 1787), reprinted in Republic of Letters 502 (J. Smith ed. 1995) (arguing that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he great desideratum in Government is . . . to modify the sovereignty as that it may be sufficiently neutral between different parts of the Society\xe2\x80\x9d and thus prevent a fixed majority from oppressing the minority).  Indeed, this Court has concluded that our system of representative democracy is premised on the assumption that elected officials will seek to represent their constituency as a whole, rather than any dominant faction within that constituency.  See <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Reno,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/630/index.html">509 U. S. 630</a>, 648 (1993).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Plan 1374C undermines this crucial assumption that congressional representatives from the majority party (in this case Republicans) will seek to represent their entire constituency.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a district obviously is created solely to effectuate the perceived common interests of one racial group, elected officials are more likely to believe that their primary obligation is to represent only the members of that group, rather than their constituency as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  <em>Shaw</em>\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of representational harms in the racial gerrymandering context applies with at least as much force in the partisan gerrymandering context because, in addition to the possibility that a representative may believe her job is only to represent the interests of a dominant constituency, a representative may feel more beholden to the cartographers who drew her district than to the constituents who live there.  See <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 329\xe2\x80\x93331 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  In short, Plan 1374C reduces the likelihood that Republican representatives elected from gerrymandered districts will act as vigorous advocates for the needs and interests of Democrats who reside within their districts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition, Plan 1374C further weakens the incentives for members of the majority party to take the interests of the minority party into account, because it locks in a Republican congressional majority of 20\xe2\x80\x9322 seats, so long as Republicans achieve at least 49% of the vote.  The result of this lock-in is that, according to the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, between 19 and 22 of these Republican seats are safe seats, meaning seats where one party has at least a 10% advantage over the other.  See App. 227\xe2\x80\x93228 (expert report of Professor Gaddie).  Members of Congress elected from such safe districts need not worry much about the possibility of shifting majorities, so they have little reason to be responsive to political minorities within their\ndistrict.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I think it is clear that Plan 1374C has a severe burden on the capacity of Texas Democrats to influence the political process.  Far from representing an example of \xe2\x80\x9cone of the most significant acts a State can perform to ensure citizen participation in republican self-governance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 9 (opinion of Kennedy, J.),<em> </em>the plan guarantees that the Republican-dominated membership of the Texas congressional delegation will remain constant notwithstanding significant pro-Democratic shifts in public opinion.   Moreover, the harms Plan 1374C imposes on Democrats are not \xe2\x80\x9chypothetical\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccounterfactual,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 13, simply because, in the 2004 elections, Republicans won a share of seats roughly proportional to their statewide voting strength.   By creating 19\xe2\x80\x9322 safe Republican seats, Plan 1374C has already harmed Democrats because, as explained above, it significantly undermines the likelihood that Republican lawmakers from those districts will be responsive to the interests of their Democratic constituents.  In addition, Democrats will surely have a more difficult time recruiting strong candidates, and mobilizing voters and resources, in these safe Republican districts.  Thus, appellants have satisfied any requisite obligation to demonstrate that they have been harmed by the adoption of Plan 1374C.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, as discussed in Part II, <em>supra</em>, the sole intent motivating the Texas Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision to replace Plan 1151C with Plan 1374C was to benefit Republicans and burden Democrats.  Accordingly, in terms of both its intent and effect, Plan 1374C violates the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s duty to govern impartially.</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhen a State adopts rules governing its election machinery or defining electoral boundaries, those rules must serve the interests of the entire community.  If they serve no purpose other than to favor one segment\xe2\x80\x94whether racial, ethnic, religious, or political\xe2\x80\x94that may occupy a position of strength at a particular point in time, or to disadvantage a politically weak segment of the community, they violate the constitutional guarantee of equal protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Karcher</em>,\n462 U. S., at 748 (Stevens, J., concurring) (citation omitted). </p>\n<p align="left">\nAccordingly, even accepting the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view that a gerrymander is tolerable unless it in fact burdens the minority\xe2\x80\x99s representative rights, I would hold that Plan 1374C is unconstitutional.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if I thought that Plan 1374C were not unconstitutional in its entirety, I would hold that the cracking of District 24\xe2\x80\x94which, under the <em>Balderas </em>Plan, was a majority-minority district that consistently elected Democratic Congressman Martin Frost\xe2\x80\x94was unconstitutional.  Readily manageable standards enable us to analyze both the purpose and the effect of the \xe2\x80\x9cgranular\xe2\x80\x9d decisions that produced the replacements for District 24.  Applying these standards, which I set forth below, I believe it is clear that the manipulation of this district for purely partisan gain violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same constitutional principles discussed above concerning the sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s duty to govern impartially inform the proper analysis for claims that a particular district is an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander.  We have on several occasions recognized that a multimember district is subject to challenge under the Fourteenth Amendment if it operates \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to minimize or cancel out the voting strength of racial <em>or political</em> elements of the voting population.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Gaffney</em> v. <em>Cummings,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/735/index.html">412 U. S. 735</a>, 751 (1973) (emphasis added); <em>Burns</em> v. <em>Richardson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/73/index.html">384 U. S. 73</a>, 88 (1966).  There is no constitutionally relevant distinction between the harms inflicted by single-member district gerrymanders that minimize or cancel out the voting strength of a political element of the population and the same harms inflicted by multimember districts.  In both situations, the State has interfered with the voter\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to \xe2\x80\x9cengage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>NAACP</em> v. <em>Alabama ex rel. Patterson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/449/index.html">357 U. S. 449</a>, 460 (1958).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I recognize that legislatures will always be aware of politics and that we must tolerate some consideration of political goals in the redistricting process.  See <em>Cousins </em>v. <em>City Council of Chicago</em>, 466 F.\xc2\xa02d 830, 847 (CA7 1972) (Stevens, J., dissenting).  However, I think it is equally clear that, when a plaintiff can prove that a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s predominant motive in drawing a particular district was to disadvantage a politically salient group, and that the decision has the intended effect, the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights have been violated.  See <em>id.</em>, at 859\xe2\x80\x93860.  Indeed, in <em>Vieth</em>, five Members of this Court explicitly recognized that extreme partisan gerrymandering violates the Constitution.  See 541 U. S., at 307, 312\xe2\x80\x93316 (Kennedy, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id.</em>, at 317\xe2\x80\x93318 (Stevens, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 343, 347\xe2\x80\x93352 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting); <em>id.</em>, at 356\xe2\x80\x93357, 366\xe2\x80\x93367 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  The other four Justices in <em>Vieth </em>stated that they did not disagree with that conclusion.  See <em>id.</em>, at 292 (plurality opinion).  The <em>Vieth</em> plurality nonetheless determined that there were no judicially manageable standards to assess partisan gerrymandering claims.  <em>Id.</em>, at 305\xe2\x80\x93306.  However, the following test, which shares some features of the burden-shifting standard for assessing unconstitutional partisan gerrymandering proposed by Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Vieth</em>, see <em>id.,</em> at 348\xe2\x80\x93351, would provide a remedy for at least the most blatant unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders and would also be eminently manageable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, to have standing to challenge a district as an unconstitutional partisan gerrymander, a plaintiff would have to prove that he is either a candidate or a voter who resided in a district that was changed by a new districting plan.  See <em>id.</em>, at 327\xe2\x80\x93328 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (discussing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hays,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/737/index.html">515 U. S. 737</a> (1995)).  See also 541 U. S.,  at 347\xe2\x80\x93348 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (citing <em>Hays</em>).  A plaintiff with standing would then be required to prove both improper purpose and effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d portion of the inquiry, I would apply the standard fashioned by the Court in its racial gerrymandering cases.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s racial gerrymandering jurisprudence, judges must analyze whether plaintiffs have proved that race was the predominant factor motivating a districting decision such that other, race-neutral districting principles were subordinated to racial considerations.  If so, strict scrutiny applies, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Vera</em>, 517 U. S., at 958\xe2\x80\x93959 (plurality opinion), and the State must justify its districting decision by establishing that it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest, such as compliance with \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act, see <em>King</em> v. <em>Illinois Bd. of Elections</em>, 979 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 619 (ND Ill. 1997), aff\xe2\x80\x99d, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/1087/index.html">522 U. S. 1087</a> (1998); <em>Vera</em>, 517 U. S., at 994 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  However, strict scrutiny does not apply merely because race was one motivating factor behind the drawing of a majority-minority district.  <em>Id.,</em> at 958\xe2\x80\x93959 (plurality opinion); see also <em>Easley </em>v. <em>Cromartie, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/532/234/index.html">532 U. S. 234</a>, 241 (2001).  Applying these standards to the political gerrymandering context, I would hold that, if a plaintiff carried her burden of demonstrating that redistricters subordinated neutral districting principles to political considerations and that their predominant motive was to maximize one party\xe2\x80\x99s power, she would satisfy the intent prong of the constitutional inquiry.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Cf. <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 349\xe2\x80\x93350 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (discussing the importance of a district\xe2\x80\x99s departures from traditional districting principles in determining whether the district is an unconstitutional gerrymander).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the effects inquiry, a plaintiff would be required to demonstrate the following three facts:  (1) her candidate of choice won election under the old plan; (2) her residence is now in a district that is a safe seat for the opposite party; and (3) her new district is less compact than the old district.  The first two prongs of this effects inquiry would be designed to measure whether or not the plaintiff has been harmed, whereas the third prong would be relevant because the shape of the gerrymander has always provided crucial evidence of its character, see <em>Karcher,</em> 462 U. S., at 754\xe2\x80\x93758, 762\xe2\x80\x93763 (Stevens, J., concurring); see also <em>Vieth</em>, 541 U. S., at 348 (Souter, J., joined by Ginsburg, J., dissenting) (noting that compactness is a traditional districting principle, which \xe2\x80\x9ccan be measured quantitatively\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, a safe harbor for more compact districts would allow a newly elected majority to eliminate a prior partisan gerrymander without fear of liability or even the need to devote resources to litigating whether or not the legislature had acted with an impermissible intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If a plaintiff with standing could meet the intent and effects prong of the test outlined above, that plaintiff would clearly have demonstrated a violation of her constitutional rights.  Moreover, I do not think there can be any colorable claim that this test would not be judicially manageable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this test to the facts of this case, I think plaintiffs in new Districts 6, 24, 26, and 32\xe2\x80\x94four of the districts in Plan 1374C that replaced parts of <em>Balderas </em>District 24\xe2\x80\x94can demonstrate that their constitutional rights were violated by the cracking of <em>Balderas </em>District 24.  First, I assume that there are plaintiffs who reside in Districts 6, 24, 26, and 32, and whose homes were previously located in <em>Balderas </em>District 24.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Accordingly, I assume that there are plaintiffs who have standing to challenge the creation of these districts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, plaintiffs could easily satisfy their burden of proving predominant partisan purpose.  Indeed, in this litigation, the State has acknowledged that its predominant motivation for cracking District 24 was to achieve partisan gain.  See State Post-Trial Brief 51\xe2\x80\x9352 (noting that, in spite of concerns that the cracking of District 24 could lead to Voting Rights Act liability, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Legislature \xe2\x80\xa6 chose to pursue a political goal of unseating Congressman Frost instead of following a course that might have lowered risks [of such liability]\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court agreed with the State\xe2\x80\x99s analysis on this issue.  In the District Court, plaintiffs claimed that the creation of District 26 violated the Equal Protection Clause because the decision to create District 26 was motivated by unconstitutional racial discrimination against black voters.  The District Court rejected this argument, concluding that the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to crack <em>Balderas </em>District 24 was driven not by racial prejudice, but rather by the political desire to maximize Republican advantage and to \xe2\x80\x9cremove Congressman Frost,\xe2\x80\x9d which required that Frost \xe2\x80\x9close a large portion of his Democratic constituency, many of whom lived in a predominately Black area of Tarrant County.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 471.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That an impermissible, predominantly partisan, purpose motivated the cracking of former District 24 is further demonstrated by the fact that, in my judgment, this cracking caused Plan 1374C to violate \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa71973c.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to adopt a plan that violated its legal obligations under the Voting Rights Act, combined with the other indicia of partisan intent in this litigation, is compelling evidence that politics was not simply one factor in the cracking of District 24, but rather that it was an impermissible, predominant factor.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act \xe2\x80\x9cwas intended \xe2\x80\x98to insure that that [the gains thus far achieved in minority political participation] shall not be destroyed through new [discriminatory] procedures and techniques.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beer</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/index.html">425 U. S. 130</a>, 140\xe2\x80\x93141 (1976) (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 94\xe2\x80\x93295, p.\xc2\xa019 (1975) (alteration in <em>Beer</em>)).  To effectuate this goal, \xc2\xa75 prevents covered jurisdictions, such as Texas, from making changes to their voting procedures \xe2\x80\x9cthat would lead to a retrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia</em>, 539 U. S., at 477 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  In other words, during the redistricting process, covered jurisdictions may not \xe2\x80\x9cleave minority voters with less chance to be effective in electing preferred candidates than they were\xe2\x80\x9d under the prior districting plan.  See <em>id.</em>, at 494 (Souter, J., dissenting).  By cracking <em>Balderas</em> District 24, and by not offsetting the loss in black voters\xe2\x80\x99 ability to elect preferred candi-\ndates elsewhere, Plan 1374C resulted in impermissible retrogression.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the <em>Balderas</em> Plan, black Americans constituted a majority of Democratic primary voters in District 24.  According to the unanimous report authored by staff attorneys in the Voting Section of the Department of Justice, black voters in District 24 generally voted cohesively, and thus had the ability to elect their candidate of choice in the Democratic primary.  Section 5 Recommendation Memorandum 33 (Dec. 12, 2003), available at http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/documents/\ntexasDOJmemo.pdf (all Internet materials as visited June 21, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Moreover, the black community\xe2\x80\x99s candidates of choice could consistently attract sufficient crossover voting from nonblacks to win the general election, even though blacks did not constitute a majority of voters in the general election.  <em>Id.</em>, at 33\xe2\x80\x9334.  Representative Frost, who is white, was clearly the candidate of choice of the black community in District 24, based on election returns, testimony of community leaders, and \xe2\x80\x9cscorecards\xe2\x80\x9d he received from groups dedicated to advancing the interests of African-Americans.  See <em>id.</em>, at 35.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted above, in Plan 1374C, \xe2\x80\x9cthe minority community in [<em>Balderas</em> District] 24 [was] splintered and submerged into majority Anglo districts in the Dallas-Fort Worth area.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 67.  By dismantling one district where blacks had the ability to elect candidates of their choice,[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] and by not offsetting this loss of a district with another district where black voters had a similar opportunity, Plan 1374C was retrogressive, in violation of \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act.  See <em>id.</em>, at 31, 67\xe2\x80\x9369.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding the unanimous opinion of the staff attorneys in the Voting Section of the Justice Department that Plan 1374C was retrogressive and that the Attorney General should have interposed an objection, the Attorney General elected to preclear the map, thus allowing it to take effect.  We have held that, under the statutory scheme, voters may not directly challenge the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s decision to preclear a redistricting plan, see <em>Morris</em> v. <em>Gressette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/491/index.html">432 U. S. 491</a> (1977), which means that the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s vigilant enforcement of the Act is critical, and which also means that plaintiffs could not bring a \xc2\xa75 challenge as part of this litigation.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  However, judges are frequently called upon to consider whether a redistricting plan violates \xc2\xa75, because a covered jurisdiction has the option of seeking to achieve preclearance by either submitting its plan to the Attorney General or filing a declaratory judgment action in the District Court for the District of Columbia, whose judgment is subject to review by this Court, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>.  Accordingly, we have the tools to analyze whether a redistricting plan is retrogressive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even though the \xc2\xa75 issue is not directly before this Court, for the reasons stated above, I believe that the cracking of District 24 caused Plan 1374C to be retrogressive.  And the fact that the legislature promulgated a retrogressive plan is relevant, because it provides additional evidence that the legislature acted with a predominantly partisan purpose.  Complying with \xc2\xa75 is a neutral districting principle, and the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s promulgation of a retrogressive redistricting plan buttresses my conclusion that the \xe2\x80\x9clegislature subordinated traditional [politically-]neutral districting principles . . . to [political] considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U.

This evidence is particularly compelling in light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Legislature \xe2\x80\xa6 chose to pursue a political goal of unseating Congressman Frost instead of following a course that might have lowered risks in the preclearance process.\xe2\x80\x9d  State Post-Trial Brief 52 (citing, <em>inter alia</em>, trial testimony of state legislators).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the record in this litigation makes clear that the predominant motive underlying the fragmentation of <em>Balderas</em> District 24 was to maximize Republicans\xe2\x80\x99 electoral opportunities and ensure that Congressman Frost was defeated.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Turning now to the effects test I have proposed, plaintiffs in new Districts 6, 24, 36, and 32 could easily meet the three parts of that test because: (1) under the <em>Balderas </em>plan, they lived in District 24 and their candidate of choice (Frost) was the winning candidate; (2) under Plan 1374C, they have been placed in districts that are safe seats for the Republican party, see App. 106 (showing that the Democratic share of the two-party vote in statewide elections from 1996 to 2002 was 40% or less in Districts 6, 24, 26, and 32); and (3) their new districts are less compact than <em>Balderas </em>District 24, see App. 319\xe2\x80\x93320 (compactness scores for districts under the <em>Balderas </em>Plan and Plan 1374C).[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy rejects my proposed effects test, as applied in this case, because, in his view <em>Balderas</em> District 24 lacks \xe2\x80\x9cany special claim to fairness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 36.  But my analysis in no way depends on the proposition that <em>Balderas</em> District 24 was fair.  The district <em>was </em>more compact than four of the districts that replaced it, and, as explained above, compactness serves important values in the districting process.  This is why, in my view, a State that creates more compact districts should enjoy a safe harbor from partisan gerrymandering claims.  However, the mere fact that a prior district was unfair should surely not provide a safe harbor for the creation of an even more unfair district.  Conversely, a State may of course create less compact districts without violating the Constitution so long as its purpose is not to disadvantage a politically disfavored group.  See <em>supra</em>, at 31\xe2\x80\x9332 and n.\xc2\xa013.  The reason I focus on <em>Balderas</em> District 24 is not because the district was fair, but because the prior district provides a clear benchmark in analyzing whether plaintiffs have been harmed.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, applying the judicially manageable test set forth in this Part of my opinion reveals that the cracking of <em>Balderas </em>District 24 created several unconstitutional partisan gerrymanders.

But the existence of ticket-splitting voters hardly demonstrates that Plan 1151C was biased in favor of Democrats.  Instead, as noted above, even the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert in this litigation concluded that Plan 1151C was, if anything, biased in favor of Republicans.  Nor do the circumstances surrounding the replacement of Plan 1151C suggest that the legislature was motivated by a misimpression that Plan 1151C was unfair to Republicans, and accordingly should be replaced with a more equitable map.

Therefore, there is no need at this point to discuss standards that would guide judges in enforcing a rule allowing legislatures to be motivated in part by partisan considerations, but which would impose an \xe2\x80\x9cobligation not to apply <em>too much </em>partisanship in districting.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vieth</em> v. <em>Jubelirer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html"></a><a href="/us/541/267/index.html">541 U.

It would, of course, be an eminently manageable standard for the Court to conclude that deviations of over 10% from symmetry create a prima facie case of an unconstitutional gerrymander, just as population deviations among districts of more than 10% create such a prima facie case.

It is indisputable that, at the very least, <em>Balderas </em>District 24 was a strong influence district for black voters, that is, a district where voters of color can \xe2\x80\x9cplay a substantial, if not decisive, role in the electoral process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Georgia </em>v. <em>Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html"></a><a href="/us/539/461/index.html">539 U.

Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of appellants\xe2\x80\x99 political-gerrymandering claims ably demonstrates that, yet again, no party or judge has put forth a judicially discernable standard by which to evaluate them.  See <em>ante,</em> at 6\xe2\x80\x9316.  Unfortunately, the opinion then concludes that the appellants have failed to state a claim as to political gerrymandering, without ever articulating what the elements of such a claim consist of.  That is not an available disposition of this appeal.  We must either conclude that the claim is nonjusticiable and dismiss it, or else set forth a standard and measure appellant\xe2\x80\x99s claim against it.  <em>Vieth, supra,</em> at 301.  Instead, we again dispose of this claim in a way that provides no guidance to lower-court judges and perpetuates a cause of action with no discernible content.  We should simply dismiss appellants\xe2\x80\x99 claims as nonjusticiable.  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would dismiss appellants\xe2\x80\x99 vote-dilution claims premised on \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for failure to state a claim, for the reasons set forth in Justice Thomas\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, which I joined, in <em>Holder </em>v.<em> Hall</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/874/index.html">512 U.

The GI Forum appellants focus on the removal of 100,000 residents, most of whom are Latino, from District 23.  They assert that this action constituted intentional vote dilution in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.  The Jackson appellants contend that the intentional creation of District 25 as a majority-minority district was an impermissible racial gerrymander.  The District Court rejected the equal protection challenges to both districts.   </p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The GI Forum appellants contend that the Texas Legislature removed a large number of Latino voters living in Webb County from District 23 with the purpose of diminishing Latino electoral power in that district.  Congressional redistricting is primarily a responsibility of state legislatures, and legislative motives are often difficult to discern.  We presume, moreover, that legislatures fulfill this responsibility in a constitutional manner.  Although a State will almost always be aware of racial demographics when it redistricts, it does not follow from this awareness that the State redistricted on the basis of race.  See <em>Miller</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/900/index.html">515 U. S. 900</a>, 915\xe2\x80\x93916 (1995).

Nevertheless, when considerations of race predominate, we do not hesitate to apply the strict scrutiny that the Equal Protection Clause requires.

In the 2002 election, he won with less than 52 percent of the vote, <em>ante,</em> at 17 (opinion of the Court), and received only 8 percent of the Latino vote, <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 488.  The District Court found that the goal of the map-drawers was to adjust the lines of that district to protect the imperiled incumbent: \xe2\x80\x9cThe record presents undisputed evidence that the Legislature desired to increase the number of Republican votes cast in Congressional District 23 to shore up Bonilla\xe2\x80\x99s base and assist in his reelection.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  To achieve this goal, the legislature extended the district north to include counties in the central part of the State with residents who voted Republican, adding 100,000 people to the district.  Then, to comply with the one-person, one-vote requirement, the legislature took one-half of heavily Democratic Webb County, in the southern part of the district, and included it in the neighboring district.  <em>Id.,</em> at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants acknowledge that the State redrew District 23 at least in part to protect Bonilla.  They argue, however, that they assert an intentional vote-dilution claim that is analytically distinct from the racial-gerrymandering claim of the sort at issue in <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Reno,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/509/630/index.html">509 U. S. 630</a>, 642\xe2\x80\x93649 (1993) <em>(Shaw I)</em>.  A vote-dilution claim focuses on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s intent to harm a minority\xe2\x80\x99s voting power; a <em>Shaw I</em> claim focuses instead on the State\xe2\x80\x99s purposeful classification of individuals by their race, regardless of whether they are helped or hurt.  <em>Id.</em>, at 651\xe2\x80\x93652 (distinguishing the vote-dilution claim in <em>United Jewish Organizations of Williamsburgh, Inc.</em> v. <em>Carey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/144/index.html">430 U. S. 144</a> (1977)).  In contrast to a <em>Shaw I</em> claim, appellants contend, in a vote-dilution claim the plaintiff need not show that the racially discriminatory motivation <em>predominated</em>, but only that the invidious purpose was <em>a</em> motivating factor.  Appellants contrast <em>Easley </em>v.<em> Cromartie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/234/index.html">532 U. S. 234</a>, 241 (2001) (in a racial-gerrymandering claim, \xe2\x80\x9c[r]ace must not simply have been <em>a </em>motivation for the drawing of a majority-minority district, but the <em>predominant</em> factor motivating the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s districting decision\xe2\x80\x9d (citation and internal quotation marks omitted)), with <em>Arlington Heights </em>v.<em> Metropolitan Housing Development Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/252/index.html">429 U. S. 252</a>, 265\xe2\x80\x93266 (1977), and <em>Rogers </em>v.<em> Lodge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/613/index.html">458 U. S. 613</a>, 617 (1982).  Whatever the validity of this distinction, on the facts of these cases it is irrelevant.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the legislature was not racially motivated when it drew the plan as a whole, <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d,<em> </em>at 473, and when it split Webb County, <em>id.,</em> at 509, dooms appellants\xe2\x80\x99 intentional-vote-dilution claim.    </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We review a district court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding of a legislature\xe2\x80\x99s motivation for clear error.  See <em>Easley</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 242.  We will not overturn that conclusion unless we are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98left with the definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been committed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Bessemer City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/index.html">470 U. S. 564</a>, 573 (1985) (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>United States Gypsum Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/364/index.html">333 U. S. 364</a>, 395 (1948)).  I cannot say that the District Court clearly erred when it found that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legislative motivation for the division of Webb County between Congressional District 23 and Congressional District 28 in Plan 1374C was political.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 509. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Appellants contend that the District Court had evidence of the State\xe2\x80\x99s intent to minimize Latino voting power.  They note, for instance, that the percentage of Latinos in District 23\xe2\x80\x99s citizen voting-age population decreased significantly as a result of redistricting and that only 8 percent of Latinos had voted for Bonilla in the last election.  They also point to testimony indicating that the legislature was conscious that protecting Bonilla would result in the removal of Latinos from the district and was pleased that, even after redistricting, he would represent a district in which a slight majority of voting-age residents was Latino.  Of the individuals removed from District 23, 90 percent of those of voting age were Latinos, and 87 percent voted for Democrats in 2002.  <em>Id.,</em> at 489.  The District Court concluded that these individuals were removed because they voted for Democrats and against Bonilla, not because they were Latino.  <em>Id.</em>, at 473, 508\xe2\x80\x93510.  This finding is entirely in accord with our case law, which has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9ca jurisdiction may engage in constitutional political gerrymandering, even if it so happens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be black Democrats and even if the State were <em>conscious</em> of that fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hunt</em> v. <em>Cromartie</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/541/index.html">526 U. S. 541</a>, 551 (1999).  See also<em> Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a>, 968 (1996) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf district lines merely correlate with race because they are drawn on the basis of political affiliation, which correlates with race, there is no racial classification to justify\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Appellants argue that in evaluating the State\xe2\x80\x99s stated motivation, the District Court improperly conflated race and political affiliation by failing to recognize that the individuals moved were not Democrats, they just voted against Bonilla.  But the District Court found that the State\xe2\x80\x99s purpose was to protect Bonilla, and not just to create a safe Republican district.  The fact that the redistricted residents voted against Bonilla (regardless of how they voted in other races) is entirely consistent with the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s political and nonracial objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I cannot find, under the clear error standard, that the District Court was required to reach a different conclusion.  See <em>Hunt,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 551.  \xe2\x80\x9cDiscriminatory purpose \xe2\x80\xa6 implies more than intent as volition or intent as awareness of consequences.  It implies that the decisionmaker \xe2\x80\xa6 selected or reaffirmed a particular course of action at least in part \xe2\x80\x98because of,\xe2\x80\x99 not merely \xe2\x80\x98in spite of,\xe2\x80\x99 its adverse effects upon an identifiable group.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U. S. 256</a>, 279 (1979) (citation, some internal quotation marks, and footnote omitted).  The District Court cited ample evidence supporting its finding that the State did not remove Latinos from the district because they were Latinos: The new District 23 is more compact than it was under the old plan, see <em>Session, </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 506, the division of Webb County simply followed the interstate highway, <em>id.,</em> at 509\xe2\x80\x93510, and the district\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9clines did not make twists, turns, or jumps that can be explained only as efforts to include Hispanics or exclude Anglos, or vice-versa,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 511.  Although appellants put forth alternative redistricting scenarios that would have protected Bonilla, the District Court noted that these alternatives would not have furthered the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s goal of increasing the number of Republicans elected statewide.  <em>Id.,</em> at 497.  See <em>Miller,</em> 515 U. S., at 915 (\xe2\x80\x9cElectoral districting is a most difficult subject for legislatures, and so the States must have discretion to exercise the political judgment necessary to balance competing interests\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor is the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding at all impugned by the fact that certain legislators were pleased that Bonilla would continue to represent a nominally Latino-majority district.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ultimate inquiry, as in all cases under the Equal Protection Clause, goes to the State\xe2\x80\x99s purpose, not simply to the effect of state action.  See <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/229/index.html">426 U. S. 229</a>, 238\xe2\x80\x93241 (1976).  Although it is true that the effect of an action can support an inference of intent, see <em>id.,</em> at 242, there is ample evidence here to overcome any such inference and to support the State\xe2\x80\x99s political explanation.  The District Court did not commit clear error by accepting it.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding with respect to District 25 is another matter.  There, too, the District Court applied the approach set forth in <em>Easley</em>, in which the Court held that race may be a motivation in redistricting as long as it is not the predominant one.  532 U. S., at 241.  See also <em>Bush</em>, 517 U. S., at 993 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]o long as they do not subordinate traditional districting criteria to the use of race for its own sake or as a proxy, States may intentionally create majority-minority districts, and may otherwise take race into consideration, without coming under strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d).  In my view, however, when a legislature intentionally creates a majority-minority district, race is necessarily its predominant motivation and strict scrutiny is therefore triggered.  See <em>id.,</em> at 999\xe2\x80\x931003 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  As in <em>Bush</em>, <em>id.,</em> at 1002, the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession here sufficiently establishes that the legislature classified individuals on the basis of their race when it drew District 25:  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o avoid retrogression and achieve compliance with \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act \xe2\x80\xa6 , the Legislature chose to create a new Hispanic-opportunity district\xe2\x80\x94new CD 25\xe2\x80\x94which would allow Hispanics to actually elect its candidate of choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Appellees 106.  The District Court similarly found that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Legislature clearly intended to create a majority Latino citizen voting age population district in Congressional District 25.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session, supra,</em> at 511.  Unquestionably, in my view, the drawing of District 25 triggers strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Texas must therefore show that its use of race was narrowly tailored to further a compelling state interest.  See <em>Shaw II</em>, 517 U. S., at 908.  Texas asserts that it created District 25 to comply with its obligations under \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act.  Brief for State Appellees 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  That provision forbids a covered jurisdiction to promulgate any \xe2\x80\x9cstandard, practice, or procedure\xe2\x80\x9d unless it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not have the purpose and will not have the effect of denying or abridging the right to vote on account of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c.  The purpose of \xc2\xa75 is to prevent \xe2\x80\x9cretrogression in the position of racial minorities with respect to their effective exercise of the electoral franchise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Beer</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/130/index.html">425 U. S. 130</a>, 141 (1976).  Since its changes to District 23 had reduced Latino voting power in that district, Texas asserts that it needed to create District 25 as a Latino-opportunity district in order to avoid \xc2\xa75 liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have in the past left undecided whether compliance with federal antidiscrimination laws can be a compelling state interest.  See <em>Miller</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 921; <em>Shaw II</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 911.  I would hold that compliance with \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act can be such an interest.  We long ago upheld the constitutionality of \xc2\xa75 as a proper exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s authority under \xc2\xa72 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on the denial or abridgment of the right to vote.  See <em>South Carolina</em> v. <em>Katzenbach</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html">383 U. S. 301</a> (1966).  If compliance with \xc2\xa75 were not a compelling state interest, then a State could be placed in the impossible position of having to choose between compliance with \xc2\xa75 and compliance with the Equal Protection Clause.  Moreover, the compelling nature of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in \xc2\xa75 compliance is supported by our recognition in previous cases that race may be used where necessary to remedy identified past discrimination.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Shaw II,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 909 (citing <em>Richmond </em>v.<em> J. A. Croson Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/488/469/index.html">488 U. S. 469</a>, 498\xe2\x80\x93506 (1989).  Congress enacted \xc2\xa75 for just that purpose, see <em>Katzenbach</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 309; <em>Beer,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 140\xe2\x80\x93141, and that provision applies only to jurisdictions with a history of official discrimination, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71973b(b), 1973c; <em>Vera</em> v. <em>Richards</em>, 861 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1304, 1317  (SD Tex. 1994) (recounting that, because of its history of racial discrimination, Texas became a jurisdiction covered by \xc2\xa75 in 1975).  In the proper case, therefore, a covered jurisdiction may have a compelling interest in complying with \xc2\xa75.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To support its use of \xc2\xa75 compliance as a compelling interest with respect to a particular redistricting decision, the State must demonstrate that such compliance was its \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98actual purpose\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that it had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98a strong basis in evidence\xe2\x80\x99 for believing,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shaw II, supra,</em> at 908\xe2\x80\x93909, n.\xc2\xa04 (citations omitted), that the redistricting decision at issue was \xe2\x80\x9creasonably necessary under a constitutional reading and application of\xe2\x80\x9d the Act, <em>Miller</em>, 515 U. S.<em>,</em> at 921.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Moreover, in order to tailor the use of race narrowly to its purpose of complying with the Act, a State cannot use racial considerations to achieve results beyond those that are required to comply with the statute.  See <em>id.,</em> at 926 (rejecting the Department of Justice\xe2\x80\x99s policy that maximization of minority districts was required by \xc2\xa75 and thus that this policy could serve as a compelling state interest).  Section 5 forbids a State to take action that would worsen minorities\xe2\x80\x99 electoral opportunities; it does not require action that would improve them.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In determining whether a redistricting decision was reasonably necessary, a court must bear in mind that a State is permitted great flexibility in deciding how to comply with \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x99s mandate.  See <em>Georgia </em>v.<em> Ashcroft</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 479\xe2\x80\x93483 (2003).  For instance, we have recognized that \xc2\xa75 does not constrain a State\xe2\x80\x99s choice between creating majority-minority districts or minority-influence districts.  <em>Id.,</em> at 480\xe2\x80\x93483.  And we have emphasized that, in determining whether a State has impaired a minority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffective exercise of the electoral franchise,\xe2\x80\x9d a court should look to the totality of the circumstances statewide.  These circumstances include the ability of a minority group \xe2\x80\x9cto elect a candidate of its choice\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cto participate in the political process,\xe2\x80\x9d the positions of legislative leadership held by individuals representing minority districts, and support for the new plan by the representatives previously elected from these districts.  <em>Id.,</em> at 479\xe2\x80\x93485.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of these many factors bearing upon the question whether the State had a strong evidentiary basis for believing that the creation of District 25 was reasonably necessary to comply with \xc2\xa75, I would normally remand for the District Court to undertake that \xe2\x80\x9cfact-intensive\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  See <em>id.,</em> at 484, 490.  Appellants concede, however, that the changes made to District 23 \xe2\x80\x9cnecessitated creating an additional effective Latino district elsewhere, in an attempt to avoid Voting Rights Act liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Appellant Jackson et\xc2\xa0al. in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93276, p. 44.  This is, of course, precisely the State\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Brief for State Appellees 105\xe2\x80\x93106.  Nor do appellants charge that in creating District 25 the State did more than what was required by \xc2\xa75.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In light of these concessions, I do not believe a remand is necessary, and I would affirm the judgment of the District Court.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court did not find that the legislature had two motivations in dividing Webb County, one invidious and the other political, and that the political one predominated.  Rather, it accepted the State\xe2\x80\x99s explanation that although the individuals moved were largely Latino, they were moved because they voted for Democrats and against Bonilla.  For this reason, appellants\xe2\x80\x99 argument that incumbent protection cannot be a compelling state interest is off the mark.  The District Court found that incumbent protection, not race, lay behind the redistricting of District 23.  Strict scrutiny therefore does not apply, and the existence <em>vel non</em> of a compelling state interest is irrelevant. </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0No party here raises a constitutional challenge to \xc2\xa75 as applied\nin these cases, and I assume its application is consistent with the\nConstitution.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Appellants argue that in <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a> (1996), we did not allow the purpose of incumbency protection in one district to justify the use of race in a neighboring district.  That is not so.  What we held in <em>Bush</em> was that the District Court had not clearly erred in concluding that, although the State had political incumbent-protection purposes as well, its use of race predominated.  See <em>id.,</em> at 969 (plurality opinion).  We then applied strict scrutiny, as I do here.  But we said nothing more about incumbency protection as part of that analysis.  Rather, we rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument that compliance with \xc2\xa75 was a compelling interest because the State had gone beyond mere nonretrogression.  <em>Id.,</em> at 983; <em>id.,</em> at, 1003 (Thomas, J., joined by Scalia, J, concurring in judgment).</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962148">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n548 U.

The question whether any such standard exists\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether a challenge to a political gerrymander presents a justiciable case or controversy\xe2\x80\x94has not been argued in these cases.

According to the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings, the State\xe2\x80\x99s drawing of district lines in south and west Texas caused the area to move from five out of seven effective Latino opportunity congressional districts, with an additional district \xe2\x80\x9cmoving\xe2\x80\x9d in that direction, to <em>six </em>out of seven effective Latino opportunity districts.  See <em>Session</em> v. <em>Perry</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 451, 489, 503\xe2\x80\x93504 (ED Tex. 2004) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The end result is that while Latinos make up 58% of the citizen voting age population in the area, they control 85% (six of seven) of the districts under the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the face of these findings, the majority nonetheless concludes that the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan somehow dilutes the voting strength of Latinos in violation of \xc2\xa72 of the Voting Rights Act.  The majority reaches its surprising result because it finds that Latino voters in one of the State\xe2\x80\x99s Latino opportunity  districts\xe2\x80\x94District 25\xe2\x80\x94are insufficiently compact, in that they consist of two different groups, one from around the Rio Grande and another from around Austin.  According to the majority, this may make it more difficult for certain Latino-preferred candidates to be elected from that district\xe2\x80\x94<em>even though Latino voters make up 55% of the citizen voting age population in the district and vote as a bloc</em>.  <em>Id.,</em> at 492, n. 126, 503.  The majority prefers old District 23, despite the District Court determination that new District 25 is \xe2\x80\x9ca more effective Latino opportunity district than Congressional District 23 had been.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 503; see <em>id.,</em> at 489, 498\xe2\x80\x93499.  The District Court based that determination on a careful examination of regression analysis showing that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Hispanic-preferred candidate [would win] <em>every </em>primary and general election examined in District 25,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 503 (emphasis added), compared to the only partial success such candidates enjoyed in former District 23, <em>id.,</em> at 488, 489, 496.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority dismisses the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s careful factfinding on the ground that the experienced judges did not properly consider whether District 25 was \xe2\x80\x9ccompact\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72.  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.  But the District Court opinion itself clearly demonstrates that the court carefully considered the compactness of the minority group in District 25, just as the majority says it should have.  The \nDistrict Court recognized the very features of District  25 highlighted by the majority and unambiguously concluded, under the totality of the circumstances, that the district was an effective Latino opportunity district, and that no violation of \xc2\xa72 in the area had been shown.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unable to escape the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding, the majority is left in the awkward position of maintaining that its <em>theory</em> about compactness is more important under \xc2\xa72 than the actual prospects of electoral success for Latino-preferred candidates under a State\xe2\x80\x99s apportionment plan.  And that theory is a novel one to boot.  Never before has this or any other court struck down a State\xe2\x80\x99s redistricting plan under \xc2\xa72, on the ground that the plan achieves the maximum number of possible majority-minority districts, but loses on style points, in that the minority voters in one of those districts are not as \xe2\x80\x9ccompact\xe2\x80\x9d as the minority voters would be in another district were the lines drawn differently.  Such a basis for liability pushes voting rights litigation into a whole new area\xe2\x80\x94an area far removed from the concern of the Voting Rights Act to ensure minority voters an equal opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.

S. 30</a> (1986),<em> </em>we found that a plaintiff challenging the State\xe2\x80\x99s use of multimember districts could meet this standard by showing that replacement of the multimember district with several single-member districts would likely provide minority voters in at least some of those single-member districts \xe2\x80\x9cthe ability \xe2\x80\xa6 to elect representatives of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 48.  The basis for this requirement was simple: If no districts were possible in which minority voters had prospects of electoral success, then the use of multimember districts could hardly be said to thwart minority voting power under \xc2\xa72.  See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cMinority voters who contend that the multimember form of districting violates \xc2\xa72 must prove that the use of a multimember electoral structure operates to minimize or cancel out their ability to elect their preferred candidates\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The next generation of voting rights litigation confirmed that \xe2\x80\x9cmanipulation of [single-member] district lines\xe2\x80\x9d could also dilute minority voting power if it packed minority voters in a few districts when they might control more, or dispersed them among districts when they might control some.  <em>Voinovich</em> v. <em>Quilter,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/146/index.html">507 U. S. 146</a>, 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (1993).  Again the basis for this application of <em>Gingles </em>was clear: A configuration of district lines could only dilute minority voting strength if under another configuration minority voters had better electoral prospects.  Thus in cases involving single-member districts, the question was whether an <em>additional</em> majority-minority district should be created, see <em>Abrams</em> v. <em>Johnson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/74/index.html">521 U. S. 74</a>, 91\xe2\x80\x9392 (1997); <em>Growe</em> v. <em>Emison,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/25/index.html">507 U. S. 25</a>, 38 (1993), or whether <em>additional</em> influence districts should be created to supplement existing majority-minority districts, see <em>Voinovich</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 154.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have thus emphasized, since <em>Gingles </em>itself, that a \xc2\xa72 plaintiff must at least show an apportionment that is likely to perform <em>better</em> for minority voters, compared to the existing one.  See 478 U. S., at 99 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he relative lack of minority electoral success under a challenged plan, when compared with the success that would be predicted under the measure of undiluted minority voting strength the court is employing, can constitute powerful evidence of vote dilution\xe2\x80\x9d).  And unsurprisingly, in the context of single-member districting schemes, we have invariably understood this to require the possibility of <em>additional</em> single-member districts that minority voters might control.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Johnson</em> v. <em>De Grandy,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/997/index.html">512 U. S. 997</a> (1994), reaffirmed this understanding.  The plaintiffs in <em>De Grandy </em>claimed that, by reducing the size of the Hispanic majority in some districts, <em>additional</em> Hispanic-majority districts could be created.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1008.  The State defended a plan that did not do so on the ground that the proposed additional districts, while containing nominal Hispanic majorities, would \xe2\x80\x9clack enough Hispanic voters to elect candidates of their choice without cross-over votes from other ethnic groups,\xe2\x80\x9d and thus could not bolster Hispanic voting strength under \xc2\xa72.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In keeping with the requirement that a \xc2\xa72 plaintiff must show that an alternative apportionment would present <em>better</em> prospects for minority-preferred candidates, the Court set out the condition that a challenge to an existing set of single-member districts must show the possibility of \xe2\x80\x9ccreating more than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> <em>De Grandy </em>confirmed that simply proposing a set of districts that divides up a minority population in a different manner than the State has chosen, without a gain in minority opportunity districts, does not show vote dilution, but \xe2\x80\x9conly that lines could have been drawn elsewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1015.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the District Court found that six majority-Latino districts were all that south and west Texas could support.  Plan 1374C provides six such districts, just as its predecessor did.  This fact, combined with our precedent making clear that \xc2\xa72 plaintiffs must show an alternative with <em>better </em>prospects for minority success, should have resulted in affirmance of the District Court decision on vote dilution in south and west Texas.  See <em>Gingles, supra,</em> at 79 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he clearly-erroneous test of [Federal Rule of Civil Procedure] 52(a) is the appropriate standard for appellate review of a finding of vote dilution\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.

That district\xe2\x80\x94District 25\xe2\x80\x94is like other districts in the State\xe2\x80\x99s plan, like districts in the predecessor plan, and like districts in the <em>plaintiffs</em>\xe2\x80\x99 proposed seven-district plan, in that it joins population concentrations around the border area with others closer to the center of the State.  The District Court explained that such \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bacon-strip\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d districts are inevitable, given the geography and demography of that area of the State.  <em>Session</em>,<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 486\xe2\x80\x93487, 490, 491, n. 125, 502.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, criticizes the District Court because its consideration of the compactness of District 25 under \xc2\xa72 was deficient.  According to the majority,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe court analyzed the issue only for equal protection purposes.  In the equal protection context, compactness focuses on the contours of district lines to determine whether race was the predominant factor in drawing those lines.  Under \xc2\xa72, by contrast, the injury is vote dilution, so the compactness inquiry embraces different considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 26<em> </em>(citation\nomitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is simply an inaccurate description of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The District Court expressly considered compactness in the \xc2\xa72 context.  That is clear enough from the fact that the majority <em>quotes </em>the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in elaborating on the standard of compactness it believes the District Court <em>should</em> have applied.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18 (quoting <em>Session</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 502); <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 28 (quoting <em>Session</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 502).  The very passage quoted by the majority about the different \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98needs and interests\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the communities in District 25, <em>ante</em>, at 18, appeared in the District Court opinion precisely because the District Court recognized that those concerns \xe2\x80\x9cbear on the extent to which the new districts\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including District 25\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care functionally effective Latino opportunity districts, important to understanding whether <em>dilution </em>results from Plan 1374C.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session</em>,<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 502 (emphasis added); see also <em>ibid.</em> (noting different \xe2\x80\x9cneeds and interests of Latino communities\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98bacon-strip\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d districts and concluding that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he issue is whether these features mean that the newly-configured districts <em>dilute the voting strength </em>of Latinos\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, the District Court addressed compactness in two different sections of its opinion: in Part VI\xe2\x80\x93C with respect to vote dilution under \xc2\xa72, and in Part VI\xe2\x80\x93D with respect to whether race predominated in drawing district lines, for purposes of equal protection analysis.  The District Court even explained, in considering in Part VI\xe2\x80\x93C the differences between the Latino communities in the bacon-strip districts (including District 25) for purposes of vote dilution under \xc2\xa72, how the same concerns bear on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection claim, discussed in Part VI\xe2\x80\x93D.  <em>Id.,</em> at 502, n. 168.  The majority faults the District Court for discussing \xe2\x80\x9cthe relative smoothness of the district lines,\xe2\x80\x9d because that is only pertinent in the equal protection context, <em>ante</em>, at 24, <em>but it was only in the equal protection context that the District Court mentioned the relative smoothness of district lines</em>.<em> </em>See<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 506\xe2\x80\x93508.  In discussing compactness in Part VI\xe2\x80\x93C, with respect to vote dilution under \xc2\xa72, the District Court considered precisely what the majority says it should have: the diverse needs and interests of the different Latino communities in the district.  Unlike the majority, however, the District Court properly recognized that the question under \xc2\xa72 was \xe2\x80\x9cwhether these features mean that the newly-configured districts dilute the voting strength of Latinos.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 502.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to that question was unambiguous:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWitnesses testified that Congressional Districts 15 and 25 would span <em>colonias </em>in Hidalgo County and suburban areas in Central Texas, but the witnesses testified, and the regression data show, that both districts are effective Latino opportunity districts, with the Hispanic-preferred candidate winning every primary and general election examined in District 25.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 503.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe District Court emphasized this point again later on:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe newly-configured Districts 15, 25, 27, and 28 cover more territory and travel farther north than did the corresponding districts in Plan 1151C.  The districts combine more voters from the central part of the State with voters from the border cities than was the case in Plan 1151C.  The population data, regression analyses, and the testimony of both expert witnesses and witnesses knowledgeable about how politics actually works in the area lead to the finding that in Congressional Districts 25 and 28, Latino voters will likely control every primary and general election outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 503\xe2\x80\x93504.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I find it inexplicable how the majority can read these passages and state that the District Court reached its finding on the effectiveness of District 25 \xe2\x80\x9cwithout accounting for the detrimental consequences of its compactness problems.\xe2\x80\x9d   <em>Ante</em>, at 35.  The majority does \xe2\x80\x9cnot question\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s parsing of the statistical evidence to reach the finding that District 25 was an effective Latino opportunity district.  <em>Ante</em>, at 28.  But the majority nonetheless rejects that finding, based on its own theory that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he practical consequence of drawing a district to cover two distant, disparate communities is that one or both groups will be unable to achieve their political goals,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 27, and because the finding rests on the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibited assumption\xe2\x80\x9d that voters of the same race will \xe2\x80\x9cthink alike, share the same political interests, and will prefer the same candidates at the polls,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  It is important to be perfectly clear about the following, out of fairness to the District Court if for no other reason: No one has made any \xe2\x80\x9cassumptions\xe2\x80\x9d about how voters in District 25 will vote based on their ethnic background.  Not the District Court; not this dissent.  There was a trial.  At trials, assumptions and assertions give way to facts.  In voting rights cases, that is typically done through regression analyses of past voting records.  Here, those analyses showed that the Latino candidate of choice prevailed in every primary and general election examined for District 25.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 499\xe2\x80\x93500.  Indeed, a plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 expert conceded that Latino voters in District 25 \xe2\x80\x9chave an effective opportunity to control outcomes in both primary and general elections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 500.  The District Court, far from \xe2\x80\x9cassum[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d that Latino voters in District 25 would \xe2\x80\x9cprefer the same candidate at the polls,\xe2\x80\x9d concluded that they were likely to do so based on statistical evidence of historic voting patterns.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the erroneous statements in the majority opinion, the District Court judges did <em>not </em>simply \xe2\x80\x9caggregat[e]\xe2\x80\x9d minority voters to measure effectiveness.  <em>Ante</em>, at 26.  They did <em>not </em>simply rely on the \xe2\x80\x9cmathematical possibility\xe2\x80\x9d of minority voters voting for the same preferred candidate, <em>ante</em>, at 28, and it is a disservice to them to state otherwise.  It is the majority that is indulging in unwarranted \xe2\x80\x9cassumption[s]\xe2\x80\x9d about voting, contrary to the facts found at trial based on carefully considered evidence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What is blushingly ironic is that the district preferred by the majority\xe2\x80\x94former District 23\xe2\x80\x94suffers from the same \xe2\x80\x9cflaw\xe2\x80\x9d the majority ascribes to District 25, except to a greater degree.  While the majority decries District 25 because the Latino communities there are separated by \xe2\x80\x9cenormous geographical distance,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 29, and are \xe2\x80\x9chundreds of miles apart,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 35, Latino communities joined to form the voting majority in old District 23 are nearly twice as far apart.  Old District 23 runs \xe2\x80\x9cfrom El Paso, over 500 miles, into San Antonio and down into Laredo.  It covers a much longer distance than \xe2\x80\xa6 the 300 miles from Travis to McAllen [in District 25].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 292 (testimony of T. Giberson); see <em>id.,</em> at 314 (report of T. Giberson) (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]istrict 23 in any recent Congressional plan extends from the outskirts of El Paso down to Laredo, dipping into San Antonio and spanning 540 miles\xe2\x80\x9d).  So much for the significance of \xe2\x80\x9cenormous geographical distance.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or perhaps the majority is willing to \xe2\x80\x9cassume\xe2\x80\x9d that Latinos around San Antonio have common interests with those on the Rio Grande rather than those around Austin, even though San Antonio and Austin are a good bit closer to each other (less than 80 miles apart) than either is to the Rio Grande.*<footcall num="*"></footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court considered expert evidence on projected election returns and concluded that District 25 would likely perform impeccably for Latino voters, better indeed than former District 23.  See <em>Session</em>,<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 503\xe2\x80\x93504, 488, 489, 496.  The District Court also concluded that the other districts in Plan 1374C would give Latino voters a favorable opportunity to elect their preferred candidates.  See <em>id.,</em> at 499 (observing the parties\xe2\x80\x99 agreement that Districts 16 and 20 in Plan 1374C \xe2\x80\x9cdo clearly provide effective Latino citizen voting age population majorities\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.,</em> at 504 (\xe2\x80\x9cLatino voters will likely control every primary and general election outcome\xe2\x80\x9d in District 28, and \xe2\x80\x9cevery primary outcome and almost every general election outcome\xe2\x80\x9d in Districts 15 and 27, under Plan 1374C).  In light of these findings, the District Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9ccompared to Plan 1151C \xe2\x80\xa6 Plaintiffs have not shown an impermissible reduction in effective opportunities for Latino electoral control or in opportunities for Latino participation in the political process.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewed against this backdrop, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Plan 1374C violates \xc2\xa72 amounts to this: A State has denied minority voters equal opportunity to \xe2\x80\x9cparticipate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973(b), when the districts in the plan a State has created have <em>better</em> prospects for the success of minority-preferred candidates than an alternative plan, simply because one of the State\xe2\x80\x99s districts combines different minority communities, which, in any event, are likely to vote as a controlling bloc.  It baffles me how this could be vote dilution, let alone how the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary conclusion could be clearly erroneous.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority arrives at the wrong resolution because it begins its analysis in the wrong place.  The majority declares that a <em>Gingles </em>violation is made out \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsidering\xe2\x80\x9d former District 23 \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation,\xe2\x80\x9d and chides the State for suggesting that it can remedy this violation \xe2\x80\x9cby creating new District 25 as an offsetting opportunity district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 22.  According to the majority, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa72 does not forbid the creation of a noncompact majority-minority district,\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he noncompact district cannot \xe2\x80\xa6 remedy a violation elsewhere in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 24.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The issue, however, is not whether a \xc2\xa72 violation in District 23, viewed \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation,\xe2\x80\x9d can be remedied by the creation of a Latino opportunity district in District 25.  When the question is where a fixed number of majority-minority districts should be located, the analysis should never begin by asking whether a <em>Gingles </em>violation can be made out in any one district \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In these circumstances, it is always possible to look at one area of minority population \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation\xe2\x80\x9d and see a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xc2\xa72 under <em>Gingles</em>.  For example, if a State drew three districts in a group, with 60% minority voting age population in the first two, and 40% in the third, the 40% can readily claim that their opportunities are being thwarted because <em>they</em> were not grouped with an additional 20% of minority voters from one of the other districts.  But the remaining minority voters in the other districts would have precisely the same claim if minority voters were shifted from their districts to join the 40%.  See <em>De Grandy</em>, 512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 1015\xe2\x80\x931016 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ome dividing by district lines and combining within them is virtually inevitable and befalls any population group of substantial size\xe2\x80\x9d).  That is why the Court has explained that no individual minority voter has a right to be included in a majority-minority district.  See <em>Shaw</em> v. <em>Hunt,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/899/index.html">517 U. S. 899</a>, 917, and n. 9 (1996) <em>(Shaw II);</em> <em>id.,</em> at 947 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  Any other approach would leave the State caught between incompatible claims by different groups of minority voters.  See <em>Session</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 499 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is neither sufficiently dense and compact population in general nor Hispanic population in particular to support\xe2\x80\x9d retaining former District 23 <em>and</em> adding District 25).</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The correct inquiry under \xc2\xa72 is not whether a <em>Gingles </em>violation can be made out with respect to one district \xe2\x80\x9cin isolation,\xe2\x80\x9d but instead whether line-drawing in the challenged area as a whole dilutes minority voting strength.  A proper focus on the district lines in the area as a whole also demonstrates why the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Vera,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/952/index.html">517 U. S. 952</a> (1996), and <em>Shaw</em> <em>II </em>is misplaced.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In those cases, we rejected on the basis of lack of compactness districts that a State defended against equal protection strict scrutiny on the grounds that they were necessary to avoid a \xc2\xa72 violation.  See <em>Vera</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 977\xe2\x80\x93981 (plurality opinion); <em>Shaw II</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 911, 916\xe2\x80\x93918.  But those cases never suggested that a plaintiff proceeding under \xc2\xa72 could rely on lack of compactness to prove liability.  And the districts in those cases were nothing like District 25 here.  To begin with, they incorporated multiple, small, farflung pockets of minority population, and did so by ignoring the boundaries of political subdivisions.  <em>Vera</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 987\xe2\x80\x93989 (Appendices A\xe2\x80\x93C to plurality opinion) (depicting districts); <em>Shaw II</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 902\xe2\x80\x93903 (describing districts).  Here the District Court found that the long and narrow but more normal shape of District 25 was shared by other districts both in the state plan and the predecessor plan\xe2\x80\x94not to mention the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 own proposed plan\xe2\x80\x94and resulted from the demography and geography of south and west Texas.  See <em>Session</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 487\xe2\x80\x93488, 491, and n. 125.  And <em>none</em> of the minority voters in the <em>Vera </em>and <em>Shaw II</em> districts could have formed part of a <em>Gingles</em>-compliant district, see <em>Vera</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 979 (plurality opinion) (remarking of one of the districts at issue that it \xe2\x80\x9creaches out to grab small and apparently isolated minority communities which, based on the evidence presented, could not possibly form part of a compact majority-minority district\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Shaw II</em>,<em> </em>517 U. S.<em>,</em> at 916\xe2\x80\x93917 (describing the challenged district as \xe2\x80\x9cin no way coincident with the compact <em>Gingles </em>district\xe2\x80\x9d); while here no one disputes that at least the Latino voters in the border area of District 25\xe2\x80\x94the larger concentration\xe2\x80\x94<em>must</em> be part of a majority-Latino district if six are to be placed in south and west Texas.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 This is not, therefore, a case of the State drawing a majority-minority district \xe2\x80\x9canywhere,\xe2\x80\x9d once a \xc2\xa72 violation has been established elsewhere in the State.  <em>Id.,</em> at 917.  The question is instead whether the State has some latitude in deciding where to place the maximum possible number of majority-minority districts, when one of those districts contains a substantial proportion of minority voters who <em>must </em>be in a majority-minority district if the maximum number is to be created at all.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Until today, no court has ever suggested that lack of compactness under \xc2\xa72 might invalidate a district that a State has chosen to create in the first instance.  The \xe2\x80\x9cgeographica[l] compact[ness]\xe2\x80\x9d of a minority population has previously been only an element of the <em>plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s</em> case.  See <em>Gingles</em>, 478 U. S., at 49\xe2\x80\x9350.  That is to say, the \xc2\xa72 plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe minority group \xe2\x80\xa6 is sufficiently large and geographically compact to constitute a majority in a single-member district.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 50.  Thus compactness, when it has been invoked by lower courts to defeat \xc2\xa72 claims, has been applied to a remedial district a <em>plaintiff</em> proposes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Sensley</em> v. <em>Albritton</em>, 385 F.\xc2\xa03d 591, 596\xe2\x80\x93597 (CA5 2004); <em>Mallory</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, 173 F.\xc2\xa03d 377, 382\xe2\x80\x93383 (CA6 1999); <em>Stabler</em> v. <em>County of Thurston</em>, 129 F.\xc2\xa03d 1015, 1025 (CA8 1997).  Indeed, the most we have had to say about the compactness aspect of the <em>Gingles </em>inquiry is to profess doubt whether it was met when the district a \xc2\xa72 plaintiff proposed was \xe2\x80\x9coddly shaped.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Growe</em> v. <em>Emison,</em> 507 U. S., at 38, 41.  And even then, we rejected \xc2\xa72 liability not because of the odd shape, but because no evidence of majority bloc voting had been submitted.  <em>Id.,</em> at 41\xe2\x80\x9342.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Far from imposing a freestanding compactness obligation on the States, we have repeatedly emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cStates retain broad discretion in drawing districts to comply with the mandate of \xc2\xa72,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Shaw II</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 917, n. 9, and that \xc2\xa72 itself imposes \xe2\x80\x9cno <em>per se </em>prohibitions against particular types of districts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Voinovich</em> v. <em>Quilter,</em> 507 U. S., at 155.  We have said that the States retain \xe2\x80\x9cflexibility\xe2\x80\x9d in complying with voting rights obligations that \xe2\x80\x9cfederal courts enforcing \xc2\xa72 lack.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vera</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 978.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s intrusion into line-drawing, under the authority of \xc2\xa72, when the lines already achieve the maximum possible number of majority-minority opportunity districts, suggests that all this is just  so much hollow rhetoric.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority finds fault in a \xe2\x80\x9cone-way rule whereby plaintiffs must show compactness but States need not,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>ante</em>, at 25, without bothering to explain how its contrary rule of equivalence between plaintiffs litigating and the elected representatives of the people legislating comports with our repeated assurances concerning the discretion and flexibility left to the States.  Section 2 is, after all, part of the Voting Rights Act, not the Compactness Rights Act.  The word \xe2\x80\x9ccompactness\xe2\x80\x9d appears nowhere in \xc2\xa72, nor even in the agreed-upon legislative history.  See <em>Gingles</em>, <em>supra,</em> at  36\xe2\x80\x9337.  To bestow on compactness such precedence in the \xc2\xa72 inquiry is the antithesis of the totality test that the statute contemplates.  <em>De Grandy</em>,<em> </em>512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 1011 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he ultimate conclusions about equality or inequality of opportunity were intended by Congress to be judgments resting on comprehensive, not limited, canvassing of relevant facts\xe2\x80\x9d).  Suggesting that determinative weight should have been given this one factor contravenes our understanding of how \xc2\xa72 analysis proceeds, see <em>Gingles, </em>478 U. S.<em>,</em> at 45 (quoting statement from the legislative history of \xc2\xa72 that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98there is no requirement that any particular number of factors be proved, or that a majority of them point one way or the other\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), particularly when the proper standard of review for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate judgment under \xc2\xa72 is clear error.  See <em>id.,</em> at 78\xe2\x80\x9379.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A \xc2\xa72 plaintiff has no legally protected interest in compactness, apart from how deviations from it dilute the equal opportunity of minority voters \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of their choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71973(b).  And the District Court found that any effect on this opportunity caused by the different \xe2\x80\x9cneeds and interests\xe2\x80\x9d of the Latino voters within District 25 was at least offset by the fact that, despite these differences, they were likely to prefer the same candidates at the polls.  This finding was based on the evidence, not assumptions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever the competing merits of old District 23 and new District 25 at the margins, judging between those two majority-minority districts is surely the responsibility of the legislature, not the courts.  See <em>Georgia</em> v. <em>Ashcroft,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/461/index.html">539 U. S. 461</a>, 480 (2003).  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s squeamishness about the supposed challenge facing a Latino-preferred candidate in District 25\xe2\x80\x94having to appeal to Latino voters near the Rio Grande and those near Austin\xe2\x80\x94is not unlike challenges candidates face around the country all the time, as part of a healthy political process.  It is in particular not unlike the challenge faced by a Latino-preferred candidate in the district favored by the majority, former District 23, who must appeal to Latino voters both in San Antonio and in El Paso, 540 miles away.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]inority voters are not immune from the obligation to pull, haul, and trade to find common political ground, the virtue of which is not to be slighted in applying a statute meant to hasten the waning of racism in American politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>De Grandy</em>, 512 U. S., at 1020.  As the Court has explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate right of \xc2\xa72 is equality of opportunity, not a guarantee of electoral success for minority-preferred candidates of whatever race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1014, n.\xc2\xa011.  Holding that such <em>opportunity</em> is denied because a State draws a district with 55% minority citizen voting-age population, rather than keeping one with a similar percentage (but lower turnout) that did not in any event consistently elect minority-preferred candidates, gives an unfamiliar meaning to the word \xe2\x80\x9copportunity.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if a plaintiff satisfies the <em>Gingles </em>factors, a finding of vote dilution under \xc2\xa72 does not automatically follow.  In <em>De Grandy</em>,<em> </em>we identified another important aspect of the totality inquiry under \xc2\xa72: whether \xe2\x80\x9cminority voters form effective voting majorities in a number of districts roughly proportional to the minority voters\xe2\x80\x99 respective shares in the voting-age population.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 1000.  A finding of proportionality under this standard can defeat \xc2\xa72 liability even if a clear <em>Gingles </em>violation has been made out.  In <em>De Grandy </em>itself, we found that \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d defeated a claim that the district lines at issue \xe2\x80\x9cdiluted the votes cast by Hispanic voters,\xe2\x80\x9d 512 U. S.<em>,</em> at 1014\xe2\x80\x931015, even assuming that the plaintiffs had shown \xe2\x80\x9cthe possibility of creating <em>more</em> than the existing number of reasonably compact districts with a sufficiently large minority population to elect candidates of its choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1008\xe2\x80\x931009 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court determined that south and west Texas was the appropriate geographic frame of reference for analyzing proportionality: \xe2\x80\x9cIf South and West Texas is the only area in which <em>Gingles </em>is applied and can be met, as Plaintiffs argue, it is also the relevant area for measuring proportionality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Session</em>,<em> </em>298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d<em>,</em> at 494.  As the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ower courts that have analyzed \xe2\x80\x98proportionality\xe2\x80\x99 in the <em>De Grandy </em>sense have been consistent in using the same frame of reference for that factor and for the factors set forth in <em>Gingles</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 493\xe2\x80\x93494, and n. 131 (citing<em> </em>cases).</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In south and west Texas, Latinos constitute 58% of the relevant population and control 85% (six out of seven) of the congressional seats in that region.  That includes District 25, because the District Court found, without clear error, that Latino voters in that district \xe2\x80\x9cwill likely control every primary and general election outcome.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 504.  But even not counting that district as a Latino opportunity district, because of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s misplaced compactness concerns, Latinos in south and west Texas still control congressional seats in a markedly greater proportion\xe2\x80\x9471% (five out of seven)\xe2\x80\x94than their share of the population there.  In other words, in the only area in which the <em>Gingles </em>factors can be satisfied, Latino voters enjoy effective political power 46% above their numerical strength, or, even disregarding District 25 as an opportunity district, 24% above their numerical strength.  See <em>De Grandy</em>, 512 U. S., at 1017, n.\xc2\xa013.  Surely these figures do not suggest a denial of equal <em>opportunity</em> to <em>participate</em> in the political process.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s only answer is to shift the focus to statewide proportionality.  In <em>De Grandy </em>itself, the Court rejected an argument that proportionality should be analyzed on a statewide basis as \xe2\x80\x9cflaw[ed],\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe argument would recast these cases as they come to us, in order to bar consideration of proportionality except on statewide scope, whereas up until now the dilution claims have been litigated on a smaller geographical scale.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1021\xe2\x80\x931022.  The same is true here: The plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa72 claims concern \xe2\x80\x9cthe impact of the legislative plan on Latino voting strength <em>in South and West Texas</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Session</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 486 (emphasis added), and that is the only area of the State in which they can satisfy the <em>Gingles </em>factors.  That is accordingly the proper frame of reference in analyzing proportionality.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, at a statewide level, 6 Latino opportunity districts out of 32, or 19% of the seats, would certainly seem to be \xe2\x80\x9croughly proportional\xe2\x80\x9d to the Latino 22% share of the population.  See <em>De Grandy</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 1000.  The District Court accordingly determined that proportionality suggested the lack of vote dilution, even considered on a statewide basis.  <em>Session</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 494.  The majority avoids that suggestion by disregarding the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding that District 25 is an effective Latino opportunity district.  That is not only improper, for the reasons given, but the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of District 25 as a Latino opportunity district is also flatly inconsistent with its statewide approach to analyzing proportionality.  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, the Latino voters in the northern end of District 25 cannot \xe2\x80\x9ccount\xe2\x80\x9d along with the Latino voters at the southern end to form an effective majority, because they belong to different communities.  But Latino voters from everywhere around the State of Texas\xe2\x80\x94even those from areas where the <em>Gingles</em> factors are not satisfied\xe2\x80\x94can \xe2\x80\x9ccount\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of calculating the proportion against which effective Latino electoral power should be measured.  Heads the plaintiffs win; tails the State loses.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State has drawn a redistricting plan that provides six of seven congressional districts with an effective majority of Latino voting-age citizens in south and west Texas, and it is not possible to provide more.  The majority nonetheless faults the state plan because of the <em>particular mix </em>of Latino voters forming the majority in one of the six districts\xe2\x80\x94a combination of voters from around the Rio Grande and from around Austin, as opposed to what the majority uncritically views as the more monolithic majority assembled (from more farflung communities) in old District 23.  This despite the express factual findings, from judges far more familiar with Texas than we are, that the State\xe2\x80\x99s new district would be a more effective Latino majority district than old District 23 ever was, and despite the fact that <em>any </em>plan would necessarily leave <em>some </em>Latino voters outside a Latino-majority district.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whatever the majority believes it is fighting with its holding, it is not vote dilution on the basis of race or ethnicity.  I do not believe it is our role to make judgments about which <em>mixes </em>of minority voters should count for purposes of forming a majority in an electoral district, in the face of factual findings that the district is an effective majority-minority district.  It is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.  When a State\xe2\x80\x99s plan already provides the maximum possible number of majority-minority effective opportunity districts, and the minority enjoys effective political power in the area well in <em>excess </em>of its proportion of the population, I would conclude that the courts have no further role to play in rejiggering the district lines under \xc2\xa72.</f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent from Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<casctfnt><footnote num="*"><p align="left">*\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s fig leaf after stressing the distances involved in District 25\xe2\x80\x94while ignoring the greater ones in former District 23\xe2\x80\x94is to note that \xe2\x80\x9cit is the enormous geographical distance separating the Austin and Mexican-border communities, coupled with the disparate needs and interests of these populations\xe2\x80\x94not either factor alone\xe2\x80\x94that renders District 25 noncompact for \xc2\xa72 purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 28, 29.

The majority asserts that Latino voters in old District 23 had found an \xe2\x80\x9cefficacious political identity,\xe2\x80\x9d while doing so would be a challenge for such voters in District 25, <em>ante</em>, at 29, but the latter group has a distinct advantage over the former in this regard: They actually <em>vote </em>to a significantly greater extent.

I see nothing to be gained by working through these cases on the standard I would have applied in <em>Vieth</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 346\xe2\x80\x93355 (dissenting opinion), because here as in <em>Vieth</em> we have no majority for any single criterion of impermissible gerrymander (and none for a conclusion that Plan 1374C is unconstitutional across the board).  I therefore treat the broad issue of gerrymander much as the subject of an improvident grant of certiorari, and add only two thoughts for the future: that I do not share Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s seemingly flat rejection of any test of gerrymander turning on the process followed in redistricting, see <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9314, nor do I rule out the utility of a criterion of symmetry as a test, see, <em>e.g.</em>, King &amp; Browning, Democratic Representation and Partisan Bias in Congressional Elections, 81 Am.

S. 461</a> (2003), that replacement of a majority-minority district by a coalition district with minority voters making up fewer than half can survive the prohibition of retrogression under \xc2\xa75 of the Voting Rights Act, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c, enforced through the preclearance requirement, <em>Georgia</em>, 539 U. S., at 482\xe2\x80\x93483.  At least under \xc2\xa75, a coalition district can take on the significance previously accorded to one with a majority-minority voting population.  Thus, despite the independence of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72 and 5, <em>id.</em>, at 477\xe2\x80\x93479, there is reason to think that the integrity of the minority voting population in a coalition district should be protected much as a majority-minority bloc would be.  While protection should begin through the preclearance process,[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] in jurisdictions where that is required, if that process fails a minority voter has no remedy under \xc2\xa75, because the State and the Attorney General (or the District Court for the District of Columbia) are the only participants in preclearance, see 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973c.  And, of course, vast areas of the country are not covered by \xc2\xa75.  Unless a minority voter is to be left with no recourse whatsoever, then, relief under \xc2\xa72 must be possible, as by definition it would not be if a numerical majority of minority voters in a reconstituted or putative district is a necessary condition.  I would therefore hold that a minority of 50% or less of the voting population might suffice at the <em>Gingles</em> gatekeeping stage.  To have a clear-edged rule, I would hold it sufficient satisfaction of the first gatekeeping condition to show that minority voters in a reconstituted or putative district constitute a majority of those voting in the primary of the dominant party, that is, the party tending to win in the general election.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This rule makes sense in light of the explanation we gave in <em>Gingles </em>for the first condition for entertaining a claim for breach of the \xc2\xa72 guarantee of racially equal opportunity \xe2\x80\x9cto elect representatives of \xe2\x80\xa6 choice,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71973: \xe2\x80\x9cThe reason that a minority group making such a challenge must show, as a threshold matter, that it is sufficiently large . . . is this: Unless minority voters possess the potential to elect representatives in the absence of the challenged structure or practice, they cannot claim to have been injured by that structure or practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  478 U. S., at 50, n.\xc2\xa017 (emphasis deleted); see also <em>id.</em>, at 90, n.\xc2\xa01 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]f a minority group that is not large enough to constitute a voting majority in a single-member district can show that white support would probably be forthcoming in some such district to an extent that would enable the election of the candidates its members prefer, that minority group would appear to have demonstrated that, at least under this measure of its voting strength, it would be able to elect some candidates of its choice\xe2\x80\x9d).  Hence, we emphasized that an analysis under \xc2\xa72 of the political process should be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98functional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 48, n.\xc2\xa015 (majority opinion); see also <em>Voinovich</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 158 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he <em>Gingles</em> factors cannot be applied mechanically and without regard to the nature of the claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  So it is not surprising that we have looked to political-primary data in considering the second and third <em>Gingles</em> conditions, to see whether there is racial bloc voting.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Abrams</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/74/index.html">521 U.

S., at 1009\xe2\x80\x931022, and determine that the black plaintiffs cannot show that submerging them in the five new districts violated their right to equal opportunity to participate in the political process and elect candidates of their choice.  The plurality, on the contrary, is willing to accept the conclusion that the minority voters lost nothing cognizable under \xc2\xa72 because they could not show the degree of control that guaranteed a candidate of their choice in the old District 24.  See <em>ante</em>, at 37\xe2\x80\x9340.  The plurality accepts this conclusion by placing great weight on the fact that Martin Frost, the perennially successful congressional candidate in District 24, was white.

First, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder \xc2\xa72, it is the status of the candidate as the chosen representative of a particular group, not the race of the candidate, that is important.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gingles</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 68 (emphasis deleted).  Second, Frost was convincingly shown to have been the \xe2\x80\x9cchosen representative\xe2\x80\x9d of black voters in old District 24.  In the absence of a black-white primary contest, the unchallenged evidence is that black voters dominated a primary that consistently nominated the same and ultimately successful candidate; it takes more than speculation to rebut the demonstration that Frost was the candidate of choice of the black voters.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  There is no indication that party rules or any other device rigged the primary ballot so as to bar any aspirants the minority voters would have preferred, see n.\xc2\xa05, <em>supra</em>, and the uncontroverted and overwhelming evidence is that Frost was strongly supported by minority voters after more than two decades of sedulously considering minority interests, App. 107 (Frost\xe2\x80\x99s rating of 94% on his voting record from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People exceeded the scores of all other members of the Texas congressional delegation, including black and Hispanic members of both major parties); <em>id.</em>, at 218\xe2\x80\x93219 (testimony by State\xe2\x80\x99s political-science expert that Frost is the African-Americans\xe2\x80\x99 candidate of choice); <em>id.</em>, at 239 (testimony by Ron Kirk, an African-American former mayor of Dallas and U.

See <em>Session </em>v. <em>Perry</em>, 298 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 451, 530 (ED Tex. 2004) (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In any event, although a history or prophecy of success in electing candidates of choice is a powerful touchstone of \xc2\xa72 liability when minority populations are cracked or packed, electoral success is not the only manifestation of equal opportunity to participate in the political process, see <em>De Grandy</em>, 512 U. S., at 1014, n.\xc2\xa011.  The diminution of that opportunity by taking minority voters who previously dominated the dominant party\xe2\x80\x99s primary and submerging them in a new district is not readily discounted by speculating on the effects of a black-white primary contest in the old district.</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The way this third condition is understood when a claim of a putative coalition district is made will have implications for the identification of candidate of choice under the first <em>Gingles </em>condition.  Suffice it to say here that the criteria may not be the same when dealing with coalition districts as in cases of districts with majority-minority populations.  All aspects of our established analysis for majority-minority districts in <em>Gingles </em>and its progeny may have to be rethought in analyzing ostensible coalition districts.</p>\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Notably, under the Texas Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s Plan 1374C, there are three undisputed districts where African-Americans tend to elect their candidates of choice.  African-Americans compose at most a citizen voting age majority (50.6%) in one of the three, District 30, see <em>Session</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 515; even there, the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert pegged the percentage at 48.6%, App. 185\xe2\x80\x93186.  In any event, the others, Districts 9 and 18, are coalition districts, with African-American citizen voting age populations of 46.9% and 48.6% respectively.  <em>Id.</em>, at 184\xe2\x80\x93185.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></div><font caps="1">\n</font></font></font></div>'
