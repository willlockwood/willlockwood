It appears with reasonable certainty that the vote of the township was for a subscription to aid in the construction of the branch road, and was intended to authorize the taking of the stock in the Pacific Railroad set apart under the "Act to aid in the building of branch railroads in the State of Missouri," approved March 21, 1868, to the Pleasant Hill and Lawrence branch.
