The right detaches upon conviction, when this second stage ends.  Before conviction, the accused is shielded by the presumption of innocence, <i>Reed</i> v. <i>Ross</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, which the Speedy Trial Clause implements by minimizing the likelihood of lengthy incarceration before trial, lessening the anxiety and concern associated with a public accusation, and limiting the effects of long delay on the accused\xe2\x80\x99s ability to mount a defense, <i>Marion</i>, 404 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 320.  The Speedy Trial Clause thus loses force upon conviction.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">This reading comports with the historical understanding of the speedy trial right.

Just as the right to speedy trial does not arise prearrest, <i>Marion</i>, 404 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 320\xe2\x80\x93322, adverse consequences of postconviction delay are outside the purview of the Speedy Trial Clause.  The sole remedy for a violation of the speedy trial right\xe2\x80\x94dismissal of the charges\xe2\x80\x94fits the preconviction focus of the Clause, for it would be an unjustified windfall to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions.  This reading also finds support in the federal Speedy Trial Act of 1974 and numerous state analogs, which impose time limits for charging and trial but say nothing about sentencing.  The prevalence of guilty pleas and the resulting scarcity of trials in today\xe2\x80\x99s justice system do not bear on the presumption-of-innocence protection at the heart of the Speedy Trial Clause.  Moreover, a central feature of contemporary sentencing\xe2\x80\x94the preparation and review of a presentence investigation report\xe2\x80\x94requires some amount of wholly reasonable presentencing delay.

That is the sole question this case presents.  We hold that the guarantee protects the accused from arrest or indictment through trial, but does not apply once a defendant has been found guilty at trial or has pleaded guilty to criminal charges.  For inordinate delay in sentencing, although the Speedy Trial Clause does not govern, a defendant may have other recourse, including, in appropriate circumstances, tailored relief under the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.

It would be an unjustified windfall, in most cases, to remedy sentencing delay by vacating validly obtained convictions.  Betterman concedes that a dismissal remedy ordinarily would not be in order once a defendant has been convicted.

With certain exceptions, the Act directs\xe2\x80\x94on pain of dismissal of the charges, \xc2\xa73162(a)\xe2\x80\x94that no more than 30 days pass between arrest and indictment, \xc2\xa73161(b), and that no more than 70 days pass between indictment and trial, \xc2\xa73161(c)(1).  The Act says nothing, however, about the period between conviction and sentencing, suggesting that Congress did not regard that period as falling within the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  Numerous state analogs similarly impose precise time limits for charging and trial; they, too, say nothing about sentencing.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Betterman asks us to take account of the prevalence of guilty pleas and the resulting scarcity of trials in today\xe2\x80\x99s justice system.  See <i>Lafler</i> v. <i>Cooper</i>, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (slip op., at 11) (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]riminal justice today is for the most part a system of pleas, not a system of trials.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The sentencing hearing has largely replaced the trial as the forum for dispute resolution, Betterman urges.  Therefore, he maintains, the concerns supporting the right to a speedy trial now recommend a speedy sentencing hear-ing.  The modern reality, however, does not bear on the presumption-of-innocence protection at the heart of the Speedy Trial Clause.  And factual disputes, if any there be, at sentencing, do not go to the question of guilt;they are geared, instead, to ascertaining the proper sentence within boundaries set by statutory minimums and maximums.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, a central feature of contemporary sentencing in both federal and state courts is preparation by the probation office, and review by the parties and the court, of a presentence investigation report.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73552; Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 32(c)\xe2\x80\x93(g); 6 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, &amp; O.

This aspect of the system requires some amount of wholly reasonable presentencing delay.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Indeed, many\xe2\x80\x94if not most\xe2\x80\x94disputes are resolved, not at the hearing itself, but rather through the presentence-report process.

The primary safeguard comes from statutes and rules.  The federal rule on point directs the court to \xe2\x80\x9cimpose sentence without unnecessary delay.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Crim.

In evaluating whether a delay in instituting judicial proceedings following a civil forfeiture violated the Due Process Clause, the Court applied the test from <i>Barker</i> v. <i>Wingo</i>,\n\n407 U.\xc2\xa0S. 514 (1972)\n\xe2\x80\x94the same test that the Court applies to violations of the Speedy Trial Clause.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>$8,850</i>,\n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 555,\n564 (1983)\n.  Under the <i>Barker</i> test, courts consider four factors\xe2\x80\x94the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.  <i>Ibid.  </i>None of the four factors is \xe2\x80\x9ceither necessary or sufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d and no one factor has a \xe2\x80\x9ctalismanic qualit[y].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Barker</i>, 407 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 533.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Montana Supreme Court did not use the <i>Barker</i> test in evaluating petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause claim.  378 Mont. 182, 193\xe2\x80\x93194, 342 P.\xc2\xa03d 971, 979 (2015).  But it seems to me that the <i>Barker</i> factors capture many of the concerns posed in the sentencing delay context and that because the <i>Barker </i>test is flexible, it will allow courts to take account of any differences between trial and sentencing delays.  See 407 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531.  The majority of the Circuits in fact use the <i>Barker </i>test for that purpose.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Sanders</i>, 452 F.\xc2\xa03d 572, 577 (CA6 2006) (collecting cases).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the appropriate case, I would thus consider the correct test for a Due Process Clause delayed sentencing challenge.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
