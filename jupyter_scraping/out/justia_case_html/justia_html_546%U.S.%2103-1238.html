In No. 04\xe2\x80\x9366, petitioner employees sought compensation for time spent donning and doffing required protective gear at a poultry processing plant operated by respondent Barber Foods, Inc. (Barber), as well as the attendant walking and waiting times.  Barber prevailed on the walking and waiting claims.

IBP claims that, because donning is not the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d that starts the workday, walking occurring immediately after donning and immediately before doffing is not compensable.  That argument, which in effect asks for a third category of activities\xe2\x80\x94those that are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d and thus not excluded from coverage by \xc2\xa74(a)(2), but are not themselves \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by \xc2\xa74(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x94is foreclosed by Steiner,</em> which made clear that \xc2\xa74 does not remove activities that are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d from FLSA coverage precisely because such activities are themselves \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  350 U.

Under the normal rule of statutory interpretation, identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning; and in \xc2\xa74(a)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xe2\x80\x9csaid principal activity or activities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csaid\xe2\x80\x9d is an explicit reference to the use of the identical term in \xc2\xa74(a)(1).

That time, which occurs after the workday begins and before it ends, is more comparable to time spent walking between two different positions on an assembly line than to the walking in <em>Anderson,</em> which occurred before the workday began<em>.  </em>Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9313.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The relevant regulations also support this view of walking.  Contrary to IBP\xe2\x80\x99s claim, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.6 does not strictly define the workday\xe2\x80\x99s limits as the period from \xe2\x80\x9cwhistle to whistle.\xe2\x80\x9d And \xc2\xa7790.7(g), n. 49, which provides that postdonning walking time is not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d excluded from \xc2\xa74(a)(1)\xe2\x80\x99s scope, does not mean that such time is always excluded and is insufficient to overcome clear statements in the regulations\xe2\x80\x99 text that support the holding here.  Pp.\xc2\xa013\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Because donning and doffing gear that is \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to employees\xe2\x80\x99 work is a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute, the continuous workday rule mandates that the time the No. 04\xe2\x80\x9366 petitioners spend walking to and from the production floor after donning and before doffing, as well as the time spent waiting to doff, are not affected by the Portal-to-Portal Act, and are instead covered by the FLSA.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317.\xc2\xa0</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0However, \xc2\xa74(a)(2) excludes from the FLSA\xe2\x80\x99s scope the time employees spend waiting to don the first piece of gear that marks the beginning of the continuous workday.  Such waiting\xe2\x80\x94which is two steps removed from the productive activity on the assembly line\xe2\x80\x94comfortably qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary\xe2\x80\x9d activity.  The fact that certain preshift activities are necessary for employees to engage in their principal activities does not mean that those preshift activities are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Steiner.  </em>No limiting principle allows this Court to conclude that the waiting time here is such an activity without also leading to the logical (but untenable) conclusion that the walking time in <em>Anderson</em> would also be a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d unaffected by the Portal-to-Portal Act.

The principal question, which is presented in both cases, is whether the time employees spend walking between the changing area and the production area is compensable under the FLSA.  The second question, which is presented only in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9366, is whether the time employees spend waiting to put on the protective gear is compensable under the statute.  In No. 03\xe2\x80\x931238, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit answered \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d to the first question, 339 F.\xc2\xa03d 894 (2003); in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9366, the Court of Appeals for the First Circuit answered \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d to both questions, 360 F.\xc2\xa03d 274, 281 (2004).  We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  543 U. S. ___ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As enacted in 1938, the FLSA, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201 <em>et seq.</em>, required employers engaged in the production of goods for commerce to pay their employees a minimum wage of \xe2\x80\x9cnot less than 25 cents an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa76(a)(1), 52 Stat. 1062, and prohibited the employment of any person for workweeks in excess of 40 hours after the second year following the legislation \xe2\x80\x9cunless such employee receives compensation for his employment in excess of [40] hours \xe2\x80\xa6 at a rate not less than one and one-half times the regular rate at which he is employed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa77(a)(3), at 1063.  Neither \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d nor \xe2\x80\x9cworkweek\xe2\x80\x9d is defined in the statute.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our early cases defined those terms broadly.  In<em> Tennessee Coal, Iron &amp; R. Co.</em> v. <em>Muscoda Local No. 123,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/590/index.html">321 U. S. 590</a> (1944), we held that time spent traveling from iron ore mine portals to underground working areas was compensable; relying on the remedial purposes of the statute and Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Dictionary, we described \xe2\x80\x9cwork or employment\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cphysical or mental exertion (whether burdensome or not) controlled or required by the employer and pursued necessarily and primarily for the benefit of the employer and his business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 598; see <em>id.,</em> at 598, n.\xc2\xa011.  The same year, in <em>Armour &amp; Co.</em> v. <em>Wantock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/323/126/index.html">323 U. S. 126</a> (1944), we clarified that \xe2\x80\x9cexertion\xe2\x80\x9d was not in fact necessary for an activity to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cwork\xe2\x80\x9d under the FLSA.  We pointed out that \xe2\x80\x9can employer, if he chooses, may hire a man to do nothing, or to do nothing but wait for something to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 133.  Two years later, in <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/680/index.html"></a><a href="/us/328/680/index.html">328 U.

Accordingly, we held that the time necessarily spent by employees walking from time clocks near the factory entrance gate to their workstations must be treated as part of the workweek.  <em>Id.</em>, at 691\xe2\x80\x93692.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The year after our decision in <em>Anderson</em>, Congress passed the Portal-to-Portal Act, amending certain provisions of the FLSA.  Based on findings that judicial interpretations of the FLSA had superseded \xe2\x80\x9clong-established customs, practices, and contracts between employers and employees, thereby creating wholly unexpected liabilities, immense in amount and retroactive in operation,\xe2\x80\x9d 61 Stat. 84, it responded with two statutory remedies, the first relating to \xe2\x80\x9cexisting claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 85\xe2\x80\x9386, and the second to \xe2\x80\x9cfuture claims,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 87\xe2\x80\x9388.  Both remedies distinguish between working time that is compensable pursuant to contract or custom and practice, on the one hand, and time that was found compensable under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansive reading of the FLSA, on the other.  Like the original FLSA, however, the Portal-to-Portal Act omits any definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cwork.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to existing claims, the Portal-to-Portal Act provided that employers would not incur liability on account of their failure to pay minimum wages or overtime compensation for any activity that was not compensable by either an express contract or an established custom or practice.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  With respect to \xe2\x80\x9cfuture claims,\xe2\x80\x9d the Act preserved potential liability for working time not made compensable by contract or custom but narrowed the coverage of the FLSA by excepting two activities that had been treated as compensable under our cases: walking on the employer\xe2\x80\x99s premises to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity of the employee, and activities that are \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary or postliminary\xe2\x80\x9d to that principal activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, Part III of the Portal-to-Portal Act, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cfuture claims,\xe2\x80\x9d provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cSec. 4.\xe2\x80\x82Relief from Certain Future Claims Under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a)\xe2\x80\x82Except as provided in subsection (b) [which covers work compensable by contract or custom], no employer shall be subject to any liability or punishment under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938, as amended, \xe2\x80\xa6 on account of the failure of such employer to pay an employee minimum wages, or to pay an employee overtime compensation, for or on account of any of the following activities of such employee engaged in on or after the date of the enactment of this Act\xe2\x80\x94</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(1)\xe2\x80\x82walking, riding, or traveling to and from the actual place of performance of the principal activity or activities which such employee is employed to perform, and</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(2)\xe2\x80\x82activities which are preliminary to or postliminary to said principal activity or activities, which occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which such employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases, such principal activity or activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  61 Stat. 86\xe2\x80\x9387 (codified at 29 U.

That regulation states:  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]o the extent that activities engaged in by an employee occur after the employee commences to perform the first principal activity on a particular workday and before he ceases the performance of the last principal activity on a particular workday, the provisions of [\xc2\xa74] have no application\xe2\x80\x9d  29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.6(a) (2005).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Similarly, consistent with our prior decisions interpreting the FLSA, the Department of Labor has adopted the continuous workday rule, which means that the \xe2\x80\x9cworkday\xe2\x80\x9d is generally defined as \xe2\x80\x9cthe period between the commencement and completion on the same workday of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s principal activity or activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7790.6(b).

At its plant in Pasco, Washington, it employs approximately 178 workers in 113 job classifications in the slaughter division and 800 line workers in 145 job classifications in the processing division.  All production workers in both divisions must wear outer garments, hardhats, hairnets, earplugs, gloves, sleeves, aprons, leggings, and boots.  Many of them, particularly those who use knives, must also wear a variety of protective equipment for their hands, arms, torsos, and legs; this gear includes chain link metal aprons, vests, plexiglass armguards, and special gloves.  IBP requires its employees to store their equipment and tools in company locker rooms, where most of them don their protective gear.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Production workers\xe2\x80\x99 pay is based on the time spent cutting and bagging meat.  Pay begins with the first piece of meat and ends with the last piece of meat.  Since 1998, however, IBP has also paid for four minutes of clothes- changing time.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  In 1999, respondents, IBP employees, filed this class action to recover compensation for preproduction and postproduction work, including the time spent donning and doffing protective gear and walking between the locker rooms and the production floor before and after their assigned shifts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a lengthy bench trial, the District Court for the Eastern District of Washington held that donning and doffing of protective gear that was unique to the jobs at issue were compensable under the FLSA because they were integral and indispensable to the work of the employees who wore such equipment.  Moreover, consistent with the continuous workday rule, the District Court concluded that, for those employees required to don and doff unique protective gear, the walking time between the locker room and the production floor was also compensable because it occurs during the workday.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The court did not, however, allow any recovery for ordinary clothes changing and washing, or for the \xe2\x80\x9cdonning and doffing of hard hat[s], ear plugs, safety glasses, boots [or] hairnet[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 03\xe2\x80\x931238, p. 65a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court proceeded to apply these legal conclusions in making detailed factual findings with regard to the different groups of employees.  For example, the District Court found that, under its view of what was covered by the FLSA, processing division knife users were entitled to compensation for between 12 and 14 minutes of preproduction and postproduction work, including 3.3 to 4.4 minutes of walking time.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate conclusions on these issues, but in part for different reasons.  339 F.\xc2\xa03d 894 (CA9 2003).  After noting that the question whether activities \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are an integral and indispensable part of the principal activities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of <em>Steiner, </em>is \xe2\x80\x9ccontext specific,\xe2\x80\x9d 339 F.\xc2\xa03d,<em> </em>at 902, the Court of Appeals endorsed the distinction between the burdensome donning and doffing of elaborate protective gear, on the one hand, and the time spent donning and doffing nonunique gear such as hardhats and safety goggles, on the other.  It did so not because donning and doffing nonunique gear are categorically excluded from being \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d as defined by the Portal-to-Portal Act, but rather because, in the context of this case, the time employees spent donning and doffing nonunique protective gear was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>de minimis </em>as a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 904.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBP does not challenge the holding below that, in light of <em>Steiner</em>, the donning and doffing of unique protective gear are \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74 of the Portal-to-Portal Act.  Moreover, IBP has not asked us to overrule <em>Steiner</em>.  Considerations of <em>stare decisis</em> are particularly forceful in the area of statutory construction, especially when a unanimous interpretation of a statute has been accepted as settled law for several decades.  Thus, the only question for us to decide is whether the Court of Appeals correctly rejected IBP\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the walking between the locker rooms and the production areas is excluded from FLSA coverage by \xc2\xa74(a)(1) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBP argues that the text of \xc2\xa74(a)(1), the history and purpose of its enactment, and the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s interpretive guidance compel the conclusion that the Portal-to-Portal Act excludes this walking time from the scope of the FLSA.  We find each of these arguments unpersuasive.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>Text</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBP correctly points out that our decision in Steiner </em>held only that the donning and doffing of protective gear in that case were activities \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to the workers\xe2\x80\x99 principal activity of making batteries.  350 U. S., at 256.  In IBP\xe2\x80\x99s view, a category of \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d activities that may be compensable because they are not merely preliminary or postliminary within the meaning of \xc2\xa74(a)(2) is not necessarily coextensive with the actual \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d which the employee \xe2\x80\x9cis employed to perform\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of \xc2\xa74(a)(1).  In other words, IBP argues that, even though the court below concluded that donning and doffing of unique protective gear are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to the employees\xe2\x80\x99 principal activity, this means only that the donning and doffing of such gear are themselves covered by the FLSA.  According to IBP, the donning is <em>not</em> a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d that starts the workday, and the walking that occurs immediately<font b="1"> after donning and immediately before doffing is not compensable.  In effect, IBP asks us<font b="1"> to create a third category of activities\xe2\x80\x94those that are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d and thus not excluded from coverage by \xc2\xa74(a)(2), but that are not themselves \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is defined by \xc2\xa74(a)(1).</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 IBP\xe2\x80\x99s submission is foreclosed by <em>Steiner</em>.  As noted above, in <em>Steiner</em>, we made it clear that \xc2\xa74 of the Portal-to-Portal Act does not remove activities which are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98integral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98principal activities\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d from FLSA coverage precisely because such activities are themselves \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 253.  While <em>Steiner</em> specifically addressed the proper interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity or activities\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa74(a)(2), there is no plausible argument that these terms mean something different in \xc2\xa74(a)(2) than they do in \xc2\xa74(a)(1).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  This is not only because of the normal rule of statutory interpretation that identical words used in different parts of the same statute are generally presumed to have the same meaning.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>Sullivan</em> v. <em>Stroop,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/478/index.html">496 U. S. 478</a>, 484 (1990).  It is<font b="1"> also because \xc2\xa74(a)(2) refers to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>said </em>principal activity or activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  61 Stat. 87 (emphasis added).  The \xe2\x80\x9csaid\xe2\x80\x9d is an explicit reference to the use of the identical term in \xc2\xa74(a)(1).</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, IBP has not offered any support for the unlikely proposition that Congress intended to create an intermediate category of activities that would be sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d to be compensable, but not sufficiently principal to commence the workday.  Accepting the necessary import of our holding in <em>Steiner</em>, we conclude that the locker rooms where the special safety gear is donned and doffed are the relevant \xe2\x80\x9cplace of performance\xe2\x80\x9d of the principal activity that the employee was employed to perform within the meaning of \xc2\xa74(a)(1).  Walking to that place before starting work is excluded from FLSA coverage, but the statutory text does not exclude walking from that place to another area within the plant immediately after the workday has commenced.</p>\n<p align="left"><left><em>Purpose</em></left></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBP emphasizes that our decision in Anderson</em> v. <em>Mt. Clemens Pottery Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/328/680/index.html"></a><a href="/us/328/680/index.html">328 U. S. 680</a>, may well have been the proximate cause of the enactment of the Portal-to-Portal Act.  In that case we held that the FLSA mandated compensation for the time that employees spent walking from time clocks located near the plant entrance to their respective places of work prior to the start of their productive labor.  <em>Id.,</em> at 690\xe2\x80\x93691.  In IBP\xe2\x80\x99s view, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 forceful repudiation of that holding reflects a purpose to exclude what IBP regards as the quite similar walking time spent by respondents before and after their work slaughtering cattle and processing meat.  Even if there is ambiguity in the statute, we should construe it to effectuate that important purpose.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is also unpersuasive.  There is a critical difference between the walking at issue in <em>Anderson</em> and the walking at issue in this case.  In <em>Anderson</em> the walking preceded the employees\xe2\x80\x99 principal activity; it occurred before the workday began.  The relevant walking in this case occurs after the workday begins and before it ends.  Only if we were to endorse IBP\xe2\x80\x99s novel submission that an activity can be sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal\xe2\x80\x9d to be compensable, but not sufficiently so to start the workday, would this case be comparable to <em>Anderson.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, there is a significant difference between the open-ended and potentially expansive liability that might result from a rule that treated travel before the workday begins as compensable, and the rule at issue in this case.  Indeed, for processing division knife users, the largest segment of the work force at IBP\xe2\x80\x99s plant, the walking time in dispute here consumes less time than the donning and doffing activities that precede or follow it.  It is more comparable to time spent walking between two different positions on an assembly line than to the prework walking in <em>Anderson.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left"><left>Regulations</left></p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations adopted by the Secretary of Labor in 1947 support respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view that when donning and doffing of protective gear are compensable activities, they may also define the outer limits of the workday.  Under those regulations, the few minutes spent walking between the locker rooms and the production area are similar to the time spent walking between two different workplaces on the disassembly line.  See 29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.7(c) (2005) (explaining that the Portal-to-Portal Act does not affect the compensability of time spent traveling from the place of performance of one principal activity to that of another).  See also \xc2\xa7785.38 (explaining, in a later regulation interpreting the FLSA, that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here an employee is required to report at a meeting place to receive instructions or to perform other work there, or to pick up and to carry tools, the travel from the designated place to the work place is part of the day\xe2\x80\x99s work, and must be counted as hours worked \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0IBP argues, however, that two provisions in the regulations point to a different conclusion\xe2\x80\x94the use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cwhistle to whistle\xe2\x80\x9d in discussing the limits of the \xe2\x80\x9cworkday,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7790.6, and a footnote stating that postchanging walking time is not \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily\xe2\x80\x9d excluded from the scope of \xc2\xa74(a)(1).  \xc2\xa7790.7(g), n.\xc2\xa049.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cwhistle to whistle\xe2\x80\x9d reference does reflect the view  that in most situations the workday will be defined by the beginning and ending of the primary productive activity.  But the relevant text describes the workday as \xe2\x80\x9croughly</em> the period \xe2\x80\x98from whistle to whistle.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7790.6(a) (emphasis added).  Indeed, the next subsection of this same regulation states:  \xe2\x80\x9c \xe2\x80\x98Workday\xe2\x80\x99 as used in the Portal Act means, in general, the period between the commencement and completion on the same workday of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s principal activity or activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7790.6(b).  IBP\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the \xe2\x80\x9cwhistle to whistle\xe2\x80\x9d reference is unavailing.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The footnote on which IBP relies states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWashing up after work, like the changing of clothes, may in certain situations be so directly related to the specific work the employee is employed to perform that it would be regarded as an integral part of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98principal activity.\xe2\x80\x99  This <em>does not necessarily mean</em>, however, that travel between the washroom or clothes-changing place and the actual place of performance of the specific work the employee is employed to perform, would be excluded from the type of travel to which section 4(a) refers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7790.7(g), n.\xc2\xa049 (emphasis added; citations omitted). </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This footnote does indicate that the Secretary assumed that there would be some cases in which walking between a locker room where the employee performs her first principal activity and the production line would be covered by the FLSA and some cases in which it would not be.  That assumption is, of course, inconsistent with IBP\xe2\x80\x99s submission that such walking is <em>always</em> excluded by \xc2\xa74(a), just as it is inconsistent with respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view that such walking is <em>never</em> excluded.  Whatever the correct explanation for the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s ambiguous (and apparently ambivalent) statement may be, it is not sufficient to overcome the clear statements in the text of the regulations that support our holding.  And it surely is not sufficient to overcome the statute itself, whose meaning is definitively resolved by <em>Steiner</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we hold that any activity that is \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d is itself a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.  Moreover, during a<font b="1"> continuous workday, any walking time that occurs after the beginning of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s first principal activity and before the end of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s last principal activity is excluded from the scope of that provision, and as a result is covered by the FLSA.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent in No. 04\xe2\x80\x9366, Barber Foods, Inc. (Barber), operates a poultry processing plant in Portland, Maine, that employs about 300 production workers.  These employees operate six production lines and perform a variety of tasks that require different combinations of protective clothing.  They are paid by the hour from the time they punch in to computerized time clocks located at the entrances to the production floor.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are Barber employees and former employees who brought this action to recover compensation for alleged unrecorded work covered by the FLSA.  Specifically, they claimed that Barber\xe2\x80\x99s failure to compensate them for (a) donning and doffing required protective gear and (b) the attendant walking and waiting violated the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After extensive discovery, the Magistrate Judge issued a comprehensive opinion analyzing the facts in detail, and recommending the entry of partial summary judgment in favor of Barber.  That opinion, which was later adopted by the District Court for Maine, included two critical rulings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, the Magistrate held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe donning and doffing of clothing and equipment required by the defendant or by government regulation, as opposed to clothing and equipment which employees choose to wear or use at their option, is an integral part of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 work [and therefore are] not excluded from compensation under the Portal-to-Portal Act as preliminary or postliminary activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. in 04\xe2\x80\x9366, pp. 36a\xe2\x80\x9340a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, the Magistrate rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims for \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation for the time spent before obtaining their clothing and equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 33a.  Such time, in the Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9ccould [not] reasonably be construed to be an integral part of employees\xe2\x80\x99 work activities any more than walking to the cage from which hairnets and earplugs are dispensed\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Accordingly, Barber was \xe2\x80\x9centitled to summary judgment on any claims based on time spent walking from the plant entrances to an employee\xe2\x80\x99s workstation, locker, time clock or site where clothing and equipment required to be worn on the job is to be obtained and any claims based on time spent waiting to punch in or out for such clothing or equipment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 33a\xe2\x80\x9334a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s opinion<font b="1"> did not specifically address the question<font b="1"> whether the walking time between the production line and the place of donning and doffing was encompassed by \xc2\xa74 of the Portal-to-Portal Act, and thus excluded from coverage under the FLSA.  Whatever the intended scope of the Magistrate\xe2\x80\x99s grant of partial summary judgment, the questions submitted to the jury after trial asked jurors to consider only whether Barber was required to compensate petitioners for the time they spent actually donning and doffing various gear.</font></font></p><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the case was submitted to the jury, the parties stipulated that four categories of workers\xe2\x80\x94rotating, set-up, meatroom, and shipping and receiving associates\xe2\x80\x94were required to don protective gear at the beginning of their shifts and were required to doff this gear at the end of their shifts.  The jury then made factual findings with regard to the amount of time reasonably required for each category of employees to don and doff such items; the jury concluded that such time was <em>de minimis </em>and therefore not compensable.  The jury further concluded that two other categories of employees\xe2\x80\x94maintenance and sanitation associates\xe2\x80\x94were not required to don protective gear before starting their shifts.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Accordingly, the jury ruled for Barber on all counts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, petitioners argued, among other things, that the District Court had improperly excluded as noncompensable the time employees spend walking to the production floor after donning required safety gear and the time they spend walking from the production floor to the area where they doff such gear.  The Court of Appeals rejected petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 argument, concluding that such walking time was a species of preliminary and postliminary activity excluded from FLSA coverage by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74(a)(1) and (2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act.  360 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 281.  As we have explained in our discussion of IBP\xe2\x80\x99s submission, see Part II, <em>supra</em>, that categorical conclusion was incorrect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners also argued in the Court of Appeals that the waiting time associated with the donning and doffing of clothes was compensable.  The Court of Appeals disagreed, holding that the waiting time qualified as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary or postliminary activity\xe2\x80\x9d and thus was excluded from FLSA coverage by the Portal-to-Portal Act.  360 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 282.  Our analysis in Part II, <em>supra</em>, demonstrates that the Court of Appeals was incorrect with regard to the predoffing waiting time.  Because doffing gear that is \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to employees\xe2\x80\x99 work is a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute, the continuous workday rule mandates that time spent waiting to doff is not affected by the Portal-to-Portal Act and is instead covered by the FLSA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The time spent waiting to don\xe2\x80\x94time that elapses <em>before </em>the principal activity of donning integral and indispensable gear\xe2\x80\x94presents the quite different question whether it should have the effect of advancing the time when the workday begins.  Barber argues that such predonning waiting time is explicitly covered by \xc2\xa74(a)(2) of the Portal-to-Portal Act, which, as noted above, excludes \xe2\x80\x9cactivities which are preliminary to or postliminary to [a] principal activity or activities\xe2\x80\x9d from the scope of the FLSA.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7254(a)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By contrast, petitioners, supported by the United States as <em>amicus curiae,</em> maintain that the predonning waiting time is \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d of donning, and is therefore itself a principal activity.  However, unlike the donning of certain types of protective gear, which is <em>always</em> essential if the worker is to do his job, the waiting may or may not be necessary in particular situations or for every employee.  It is certainly not \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d in the same sense that the donning is.  It does, however, always comfortably qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary\xe2\x80\x9d activity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus do not agree with petitioners that the predonning waiting time at issue in this case is a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As Barber points out, the fact that certain preshift activities are necessary for employees to engage in their principal activities does not mean that those preshift activities are \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Steiner</em>.  For example, walking from a time clock near the factory gate to a workstation is certainly necessary for employees to begin their work, but it is indisputable that the Portal-to-Portal Act evinces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to repudiate <em>Anderson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that such walking time was compensable under the FLSA.  We discern no limiting principle that would allow us to conclude that the waiting time in dispute here is a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a), without also leading to the logical (but untenable) conclusion that the walking time at issue in <em>Anderson</em> would be a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa74(a) and would thus be unaffected by the Portal-to-Portal Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government also relies on a regulation promulgated by the Secretary of Labor as supporting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 view.  That regulation, 29 CFR \xc2\xa7790.7(h) (2005), states that when an employee \xe2\x80\x9cis required by his employer to report at a particular hour at his workbench or other place where he performs his principal activity, if the employee is there at that hour ready and willing to work but for some reason beyond his control there is no work for him to perform until some time has elapsed, waiting for work would be an integral part of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s principal activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  That regulation would be applicable if Barber required its workers to report to the changing area at a specific time only to find that no protective gear was available until after some time had elapsed, but there is no such evidence in the record in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0More pertinent, we believe, is the portion of \xc2\xa7790.7 that characterizes the time that employees must spend waiting to check in or waiting to receive their paychecks as generally a \xe2\x80\x9cpreliminary\xe2\x80\x9d activity covered by the Portal-to-Portal Act.  See \xc2\xa7790.7(g).  That regulation is fully consistent with the statutory provisions that allow the compensability of such collateral activities to depend on either the agreement of the parties or the custom and practice in the particular industry.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, we are not persuaded that such waiting\xe2\x80\x94which in this case is two steps removed from the productive activity on the assembly line\xe2\x80\x94is \xe2\x80\x9cintegral and indispensable\xe2\x80\x9d to a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal activity\xe2\x80\x9d that identifies the time when the continuous workday begins.  Accordingly, we hold that \xc2\xa74(a)(2) excludes from the scope of the FLSA the time employees spend waiting to don the first piece of gear that marks the beginning of the continuous workday.</f></p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in No. 03\xe2\x80\x931238.

Under the provisions of section 4, one of the conditions that must be present before \xe2\x80\x98preliminary\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98postliminary\xe2\x80\x99 activities are excluded from hours worked is that they \xe2\x80\x98occur either prior to the time on any particular workday at which the employee commences, or subsequent to the time on any particular workday at which he ceases\xe2\x80\x99 the principal activity or activities which he is employed to perform.  Accordingly, to the extent that activities engaged in by an employee occur after the employee commences to perform the first principal activity on a particular workday and before he ceases the performance of the last principal activity on a particular workday, the provisions of that section have no application.  Periods of time between the commencement of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s first principal activity and the completion of his last principal activity on any workday must be included in the computation of hours worked to the same extent as would be required if the Portal Act had not been enacted.  The principles for determining hours worked within the \xe2\x80\x98workday\xe2\x80\x99 proper will continue to be those established under the Fair Labor Standards Act without reference to the Portal Act, which is concerned with this question only as it relates to time spent outside the \xe2\x80\x98workday\xe2\x80\x99 in activities of the kind described in section 4.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7790.6(a) (footnotes omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0IBP does not contend that this clothes-changing time fully compensated respondents for<font b="1"> the preproduction and postproduction time at issue in this case.</font></p><font b="1">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The District Court explained:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWalking time is compensable if it occurs after the start of the workday.  29 U.
