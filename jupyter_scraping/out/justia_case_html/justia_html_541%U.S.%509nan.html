Argued January 13, 2004\xe2\x80\x94Decided May 17, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">Respondent paraplegics filed this action for damages and equitable relief, alleging that Tennessee and a number of its counties had denied them physical access to that State\xe2\x80\x99s courts in violation of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), which provides: \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation or denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity,\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S. C. \xc2\xa712132.  After the District Court denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss on Eleventh Amendment immunity grounds, the Sixth Circuit held the appeal in abeyance pending <em>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</em> v. <em>Garrett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/356/index.html">531 U. S. 356</a>.  This Court later ruled in <em>Garrett</em> that the Eleventh Amendment bars private money damages actions for state violations of ADA Title I, which prohibits employment discrimination against the disabled.  The en banc Sixth Circuit then issued its <em>Popovich </em>decision, in which it interpreted <em>Garrett</em> to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles, but not those relying on due process, and therefore permitted a Title II damages action to proceed despite the State\xe2\x80\x99s immunity claim.  Thereafter, a Sixth Circuit panel affirmed the dismissal denial in this case, explaining that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles.  In response to a rehearing petition arguing that <em>Popovich </em>did not control because respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion, explaining that due process protects the right of access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II established, <em>inter alia</em>, that physical barriers in courthouses and courtrooms have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity for such access.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>As it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts, Title II constitutes a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 authority under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment to enforce that Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s substantive guarantees.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Determining whether Congress has constitutionally abrogated a State\xe2\x80\x99s Eleventh Amendment immunity requires resolution of two predicate questions: (1) whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate; and (2), if so, whether it acted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.  <em>Kimel</em> v. <em>Florida Bd. of Regents, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/62/index.html">528 U. S. 62</a>, 73.  The first question is easily answered here, since the ADA specifically provides for abrogation.  See \xc2\xa712202.  With regard to the second question, Congress can abrogate state sovereign immunity pursuant to a valid exercise of its power under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>E.g., Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Bitzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/index.html">427 U. S. 445</a>, 456.  That power is not, however, unlimited.  While Congress must have a wide berth in devising appropriate remedial and preventative measures for unconstitutional actions, those measures may not work a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive change in the governing law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Boerne</em> v. <em>Flores,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/index.html">521 U. S. 507</a>, 519.  In <em>Boerne</em>, the Court set forth the test for distinguishing between permissible remedial legislation and unconstitutional substantive redefinition: Section 5 legislation is valid if it exhibits \xe2\x80\x9ca congruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d between an injury and the means adopted to prevent or remedy it.  <em>Id.,</em> at 520.  Applying the <em>Boerne</em> test in <em>Garrett</em>, the Court concluded that ADA Title I was not a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 power because the historical record and the statute\xe2\x80\x99s broad sweep suggested that Title I\xe2\x80\x99s true aim was not so much enforcement, but an attempt to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.  531 U. S., at 372\xe2\x80\x93374.  In view of significant differences between Titles I and II, however, <em>Garrett</em> left open the question whether Title II is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 power, <em>id.,</em> at 360, n.\xc2\xa01.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Title II is a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 enforcement power.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9323.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The <em>Boerne</em> inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s first step requires identification of the constitutional rights Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II.  <em>Garrett,</em> 531 U. S., at 365.  Like Title I, Title II seeks to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on irrational disability discrimination, <em>Garrett,</em> 531 U. S., at 366.  But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, including some, like the right of access to the courts here at issue, infringements of which are subject to heightened judicial scrutiny.  See, <em>e.g., Dunn</em> v. <em>Blumstein,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/index.html">405 U. S. 330</a>, 336\xe2\x80\x93337.  Whether Title II validly enforces such constitutional rights is a question that \xe2\x80\x9cmust be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g., South Carolina</em> v. <em>Katzenbach,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html">383 U. S. 301</a>, 308.  Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment of persons with disabilities in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.  The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in the decisions of this and other courts, which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of public programs and services.  With respect to the particular services at issue, Congress learned that many individuals, in many States, were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities.  A Civil Rights Commission report before Congress showed that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by such persons.  Congress also heard testimony from those persons describing the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses.  And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of their exclusion from state judicial services and programs, including failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities.  The sheer volume of such evidence far exceeds the record in last Term\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Nevada Dept. of Human Resources </em>v. <em>Hibbs, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/721/index.html">538 U. S. 721</a>, 728\xe2\x80\x93733, in which the Court approved the family-care leave provision of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 as valid \xc2\xa75 legislation.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 finding in the ADA that \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as \xe2\x80\xa6 access to public services,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa712101(a)(3), together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment.  Unquestionably, it is valid \xc2\xa75 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination at issue, Title II\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts.  The long history of unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has persisted despite several state and federal legislative efforts to remedy the problem.  Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of these previous efforts, Congress was justified in concluding that the difficult and intractable problem of disability discrimination warranted added prophylactic measures.  <em>Hibbs, </em>538 U. S., at 737.  The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.  Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.  \xc2\xa712132.  But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible or to compromise essential eligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only \xe2\x80\x9creasonable modifications\xe2\x80\x9d that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service.  <em>Ibid</em>.  Title II\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations make clear that the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in various ways, including less costly measures than structural changes.  This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established due process principle that, within the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard in its courts.  <em>Boddie, </em>401 U. S., at 379.  A number of affirmative obligations flow from this principle.  Cases such as <em>Boddie, Griffin</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/351/12/index.html">351 U. S. 12</a>, and <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a>, make clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone cannot justify a State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts.  Judged against this backdrop, Title II\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative obligation to accommodate is a reasonable prophylactic measure, reasonably targeted to a legitimate end.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712131\xe2\x80\x9312165, provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa712132.  The question presented in this case is whether Title II exceeds Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In August 1998, respondents George Lane and Beverly Jones filed this action against the State of Tennessee and a number of Tennessee counties, alleging past and ongoing violations of Title II.  Respondents, both of whom are paraplegics who use wheelchairs for mobility, claimed that they were denied access to, and the services of, the state court system by reason of their disabilities.  Lane alleged that he was compelled to appear to answer a set of criminal charges on the second floor of a county courthouse that had no elevator.  At his first appearance, Lane crawled up two flights of stairs to get to the courtroom.  When Lane returned to the courthouse for a hearing, he refused to crawl again or to be carried by officers to the courtroom; he consequently was arrested and jailed for failure to appear.  Jones, a certified court reporter, alleged that she has not been able to gain access to a number of county courthouses, and, as a result, has lost both work and an opportunity to participate in the judicial process.  Respondents sought damages and equitable relief.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State moved to dismiss the suit on the ground that it was barred by the Eleventh Amendment.  The District Court denied the motion without opinion, and the State appealed.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The United States intervened to defend Title II\xe2\x80\x99s abrogation of the States\xe2\x80\x99 Eleventh Amendment immunity.  On April 28, 2000, after the appeal had been briefed and argued, the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit entered an order holding the case in abeyance pending our decision in <em>Board of Trustees of Univ. of Ala.</em> v. <em>Garrett,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/356/index.html"></a><a href="/us/531/356/index.html">531 U. S. 356</a> (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Garrett</em>, we concluded that the Eleventh Amendment bars private suits seeking money damages for state violations of Title I of the ADA.  We left open, however, the question whether the Eleventh Amendment permits suits for money damages under Title II.  <em>Id.,</em> at 360, n.\xc2\xa01.  Following the <em>Garrett</em> decision, the Court of Appeals, sitting en banc, heard argument in a Title II suit brought by a hearing-impaired litigant who sought money damages for the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to accommodate his disability in a child custody proceeding.  <em>Popovich</em> v. <em>Cuyahoga County Court</em>, 276 F.\xc2\xa03d 808 (CA6 2002).  A divided court permitted the suit to proceed despite the State\xe2\x80\x99s assertion of Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The majority interpreted <em>Garrett</em> to bar private ADA suits against States based on equal protection principles, but not those that rely on due process principles.  276 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>, </em>at 811\xe2\x80\x93816.  The minority concluded that Congress had not validly abrogated the States\xe2\x80\x99 Eleventh Amendment immunity for any Title II claims, <em>id., </em>at 821, while the concurring opinion concluded that Title II validly abrogated state sovereign immunity with respect to both equal protection and due process claims, <em>id., </em>at 818. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following the en banc<em> </em>decision in <em>Popovich</em>, a panel of the Court of Appeals entered an order affirming the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss in this case.  Judgt. order reported at 40 Fed. Appx. 911 (CA6 2002).  The order explained that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims were not barred because they were based on due process principles.  In response to a petition for rehearing arguing that <em>Popovich </em>was not controlling because the complaint did not allege due process violations, the panel filed an amended opinion.  It explained that the Due Process Clause protects the right of access to the courts, and that the evidence before Congress when it enacted Title II \xe2\x80\x9cestablished that physical barriers in government buildings, including courthouses and in the courtrooms themselves, have had the effect of denying disabled people the opportunity to access vital services and to exercise fundamental rights guaranteed by the Due Process Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  315 F.\xc2\xa03d 680, 682 (CA6 2003).  Moreover, that \xe2\x80\x9crecord demonstrated that public entities\xe2\x80\x99 failure to accommodate the needs of qualified persons with disabilities may result directly from unconstitutional animus and impermissible stereotypes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 683.  The panel did not, however, categorically reject the State\xe2\x80\x99s submission.  It instead noted that the case presented difficult questions that \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be clarified absent a factual record,\xe2\x80\x9d and remanded for further proceedings.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/941/index.html">539 U. S. 941</a> (2003), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The ADA was passed by large majorities in both Houses of Congress after decades of deliberation and investigation into the need for comprehensive legislation to address discrimination against persons with disabilities.  In the years immediately preceding the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Congress held 13 hearings and created a special task force that gathered evidence from every State in the Union.  The conclusions Congress drew from this evidence are set forth in the task force and Committee Reports, described in lengthy legislative hearings, and summarized in the preamble to the statute.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Central among these conclusions was Congress\xe2\x80\x99 finding that</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cindividuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712101(a)(7).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Invoking \xe2\x80\x9cthe sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce,\xe2\x80\x9d the ADA is designed \xe2\x80\x9cto provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712101(b)(1), (b)(4).  It forbids discrimination against persons with disabilities in three major areas of public life: employment, which is covered by Title I of the statute; public services, programs, and activities, which are the subject of Title II; and public accommodations, which are covered by Title III.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title II, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712131\xe2\x80\x9312134, prohibits any public entity from discriminating against \xe2\x80\x9cqualified\xe2\x80\x9d persons with disabilities in the provision or operation of public services, programs, or activities.  The Act defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cpublic entity\xe2\x80\x9d to include state and local governments, as well as their agencies and instrumentalities.  \xc2\xa712131(1).  Persons with disabilities are \xe2\x80\x9cqualified\xe2\x80\x9d if they, \xe2\x80\x9cwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, mee[t] the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa712131(2).  Title II\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement provision incorporates by reference \xc2\xa7505 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 92 Stat. 2982, as added, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7794a, which authorizes private citizens to bring suits for money damages.  42 U.

S., at 363; <em>Kimel</em> v. <em>Florida Bd. of Regents, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/528/62/index.html"></a><a href="/us/528/62/index.html"></a><a href="/us/528/62/index.html">528 U. S. 62</a>, 72\xe2\x80\x9373 (2000).  Our cases have also held that Congress may abrogate the State\xe2\x80\x99s Eleventh Amendment immunity.  To determine whether it has done so in any given case, we \xe2\x80\x9cmust resolve two predicate questions: first, whether Congress unequivocally expressed its intent to abrogate that immunity; and second, if it did, whether Congress acted pursuant to a valid grant of constitutional authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 73.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first question is easily answered in this case.  The Act specifically provides: \xe2\x80\x9cA State shall not be immune under the eleventh amendment to the Constitution of the United States from an action in Federal or State court of competent jurisdiction for a violation of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712202.  As in <em>Garrett</em>, see 531 U. S., at 363\xe2\x80\x93364, no party disputes the adequacy of that expression of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to abrogate the States\xe2\x80\x99 Eleventh Amendment immunity.  The question, then, is whether Congress had the power to give effect to its intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Fitzpatrick </em>v. <em>Bitzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/427/445/index.html"></a><a href="/us/427/445/index.html">427 U.

We upheld the FMLA as a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 power to combat unconstitutional sex discrimination, even though there was no suggestion that the State\xe2\x80\x99s leave policy was adopted or applied with a discriminatory purpose that would render it unconstitutional under the rule of <em>Personnel Administrator of Mass.</em> v. <em>Feeney,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/256/index.html">442 U.

We began by noting that Congress enacted RFRA \xe2\x80\x9cin direct response\xe2\x80\x9d to our decision in <em>Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore.</em> v. <em>Smith,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/872/index.html">494 U.

Though the respondent attempted to defend the statute as a reasonable means of enforcing the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in <em>Smith</em>, we concluded that RFRA was \xe2\x80\x9cso out of proportion\xe2\x80\x9d to that objective that it could be understood only as an attempt to work a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive change in constitutional protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 529, 532.  Indeed, that was the very purpose of the law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court further defined the contours of <em>Boerne</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d test in <em>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed.

At issue in that case was the validity of the Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (hereinafter Patent Remedy Act), a statutory amendment Congress enacted in the wake of our decision in <em>Atascadero State Hospital</em> v. <em>Scanlon,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/234/index.html">473 U.

Noting the virtually complete absence of a history of unconstitutional patent infringement on the part of the States, as well as the Act\xe2\x80\x99s expansive coverage, the Court concluded that the Patent Remedy Act\xe2\x80\x99s apparent aim was to serve the Article I concerns of \xe2\x80\x9cprovid[ing] a uniform remedy for patent infringement and \xe2\x80\xa6 plac[ing] States on the same footing as private parties under that regime,\xe2\x80\x9d and not to enforce the guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 647\xe2\x80\x93648.

As in <em>Florida Prepaid</em>, we concluded Congress\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of its prophylactic \xc2\xa75 power was unsupported by a relevant history and pattern of constitutional violations.  531 U.

Although the dissent pointed out that Congress had before it a great deal of evidence of discrimination by the States against persons with disabilities, <em>id.</em>, at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion noted that the \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming majority\xe2\x80\x9d of that evidence related to \xe2\x80\x9cthe provision of public services and public accommodations, which areas are addressed in Titles II and III,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than Title I, <em>id.,</em> at 371, n.\xc2\xa07.  We also noted that neither the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s legislative findings nor its legislative history reflected a concern that the States had been engaging in a pattern of unconstitutional employment discrimination.  We emphasized that the House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA focused on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discrimination [in] \xe2\x80\xa6<em> employment in the private sector</em>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and made no mention of discrimination in public employment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 371\xe2\x80\x93372 (quoting S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

Finally, we concluded that Title I\xe2\x80\x99s broad remedial scheme was insufficiently targeted to remedy or prevent unconstitutional discrimination in public employment.  Taken together, the historical record and the broad sweep of the statute suggested that Title I\xe2\x80\x99s true aim was not so much to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions against disability discrimination in public employment as it was to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite\xe2\x80\x9d this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence.  531 U.

It is to that question that we now turn.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first step of the <em>Boerne</em> inquiry requires us to identify the constitutional right or rights that Congress sought to enforce when it enacted Title II.  <em>Garrett,</em> 531 U. S., at 365.  In <em>Garrett</em> we identified Title I\xe2\x80\x99s purpose as enforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s command that \xe2\x80\x9call persons similarly situated should be treated alike.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Cleburne</em> v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/432/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/432/index.html">473 U. S. 432</a>, 439 (1985).  As we<em> </em>observed, classifications based on disability violate that constitutional command if they lack a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental purpose.  <em>Garrett,</em> 531 U. S., at 366 (citing <em>Cleburne,</em> 473 U. S., at 446).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title II, like Title I, seeks to enforce this prohibition on irrational disability discrimination.  But it also seeks to enforce a variety of other basic constitutional guarantees, infringements of which are subject to more searching judicial review.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Dunn</em> v. <em>Blumstein,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/index.html">405 U. S. 330</a>, 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (1972); <em>Shapiro</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/index.html">394 U. S. 618</a>, 634 (1969); <em>Skinner</em> v. <em>Oklahoma ex rel. Williamson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/316/535/index.html">316 U. S. 535</a>, 541 (1942).  These rights include some, like the right of access to the courts at issue in this case, that are protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  The Due Process Clause and the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment, as applied to the States via the Fourteenth Amendment, both guarantee to a criminal defendant such as respondent Lane the \xe2\x80\x9cright to be present at all stages of the trial where his absence might frustrate the fairness of the proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Faretta</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/index.html">422 U. S. 806</a>, 819, n.\xc2\xa015 (1975).  The Due Process Clause also requires the States to afford certain civil litigants a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to be heard\xe2\x80\x9d by removing obstacles to their full participation in judicial proceedings.  <em>Boddie</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/371/index.html">401 U.

We have held that the Sixth Amendment guarantees to criminal defendants the right to trial by a jury composed of a fair cross section of the community, noting that the exclusion of \xe2\x80\x9cidentifiable segments playing major roles in the community cannot be squared with the constitutional concept of jury trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/index.html">419 U. S. 522</a>, 530 (1975).  And, finally, we have recognized that members of the public have a right of access to criminal proceedings secured by the First Amendment.  <em>Press&amp;nbhyph;Enterprise Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/index.html">478 U. S. 1</a>, 8\xe2\x80\x9315 (1986).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether Title II validly enforces these constitutional rights is a question that \xe2\x80\x9cmust be judged with reference to the historical experience which it reflects.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>South Carolina</em> v. <em>Katzenbach,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html"></a><a href="/us/383/301/index.html">383 U.

While \xc2\xa75 authorizes Congress to enact reasonably prophylactic remedial legislation, the appropriateness of the remedy depends on the gravity of the harm it seeks to prevent.  \xe2\x80\x9cDifficult and intractable problems often require powerful remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kimel, </em>528 U. S., at 88, but it is also true that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]trong measures appropriate to address one harm may be an unwarranted response to another, lesser one,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Boerne,</em> 521 U. S., at 530.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not difficult to perceive the harm that Title II is designed to address.  Congress enacted Title II against a backdrop of pervasive unequal treatment in the administration of state services and programs, including systematic deprivations of fundamental rights.  For example, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s of 1979, most States \xe2\x80\xa6 categorically disqualified \xe2\x80\x98idiots\xe2\x80\x99 from voting, without regard to individual capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The majority of these laws remain on the books,[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and have been the subject of legal challenge as recently as 2001.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Similarly, a number of States have prohibited and continue to prohibit persons with disabilities from engaging in activities such as marrying[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and serving as jurors.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The historical experience that Title II reflects is also documented in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, which have identified unconstitutional treatment of disabled persons by state agencies in a variety of settings, including unjustified commitment, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Indiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/715/index.html">406 U. S. 715</a> (1972); the abuse and neglect of persons committed to state mental health hospitals, <em>Youngberg</em> v. <em>Romeo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/307/index.html">457 U.

The decisions of other courts, too, document a pattern of unequal treatment in the adminis-\ntration of a wide range of public services, programs,\nand activities, including the penal system,[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] public\neducation,[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>] and voting.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Notably, these decisions also demonstrate a pattern of unconstitutional treatment in the administration of justice.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This pattern of disability discrimination persisted despite several federal and state legislative efforts to address it.  In the deliberations that led up to the enactment of the ADA, Congress identified important shortcomings in existing laws that rendered them \xe2\x80\x9cinadequate to address the pervasive problems of discrimination that people with disabilities are facing.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

See <em>Garrett,</em> 531 U. S., at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  See also <em>id.,</em> at 391 (App. C to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting).  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Garrett</em> observed, the \xe2\x80\x9coverwhelming majority\xe2\x80\x9d of these examples concerned discrimination in the administration of public programs and services.  <em>Id.,</em> at 371, n.\xc2\xa07; Government\xe2\x80\x99s Lodging in <em>Garrett, </em>O.\xc2\xa0T. 2000, No. 99\xe2\x80\x931240 (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the particular services at issue in this case, Congress learned that many individuals, in many States across the country, were being excluded from courthouses and court proceedings by reason of their disabilities.  A report before Congress showed that some 76% of public services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible to and unusable by persons with disabilities, even taking into account the possibility that the services and programs might be restructured or relocated to other parts of the buildings.  U. S. Civil Rights Commission, Accommodating the Spectrum of Individual Abilities 39 (1983).  Congress itself heard testimony from persons with disabilities who described the physical inaccessibility of local courthouses.

And its appointed task force heard numerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs, including exclusion of persons with visual impairments and hearing impairments from jury service, failure of state and local governments to provide interpretive services for the hearing impaired, failure to permit the testimony of adults with developmental disabilities in abuse cases, and failure to make courtrooms accessible to witnesses with physical disabilities.

Just last Term in <em>Hibbs</em>, we approved the family-care leave provision of the FMLA as valid \xc2\xa75 legislation based primarily on evidence of disparate provision of parenting leave, little of which concerned unconstitutional state conduct.  538 U. S., at 728\xe2\x80\x93733.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  We explained that because the FMLA was targeted at sex-based classifications, which are subject to a heightened standard of judicial scrutiny, \xe2\x80\x9cit was easier for Congress to show a pattern of state constitutional violations\xe2\x80\x9d than in <em>Garrett </em>or <em>Kimel</em>, both of which concerned legislation that targeted classifications subject to rational-basis review.  538 U. S.<em>,</em> at 735\xe2\x80\x93737.  Title II is aimed at the enforcement of a variety of basic rights, including the right of access to the courts at issue in this case, that call for a standard of judicial review at least as searching, and in some cases more searching, than the standard that applies to sex-based classifications.  And in any event, the record of constitutional violations in this case\xe2\x80\x94including judicial findings of unconstitutional state action, and statistical, legislative, and anecdotal evidence of the widespread exclusion of persons with disabilities from the enjoyment of public services\xe2\x80\x94far exceeds the record in <em>Hibbs</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The conclusion that Congress drew from this body of evidence is set forth in the text of the ADA itself: \xe2\x80\x9c[D]iscrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as \xe2\x80\xa6 education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and <em>access to public services</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712101(a)(3) (emphasis added).  This finding, together with the extensive record of disability discrimination that underlies it, makes clear beyond peradventure that inadequate provision of public services and access to public facilities was an appropriate subject for prophylactic legislation.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only question that remains is whether Title II is an appropriate response to this history and pattern of unequal treatment.  At the outset, we must determine the scope of that inquiry.  Title II\xe2\x80\x94unlike RFRA, the Patent Remedy Act, and the other statutes we have reviewed for validity under \xc2\xa75\xe2\x80\x94reaches a wide array of official conduct in an effort to enforce an equally wide array of constitutional guarantees.  Petitioner urges us both to examine the broad range of Title II\xe2\x80\x99s applications all at once, and to treat that breadth as a mark of the law\xe2\x80\x99s invalidity.  According to petitioner, the fact that Title II applies not only to public education and voting-booth access but also to seating at state-owned hockey rinks indicates that Title II is not appropriately tailored to serve its objectives.  But nothing in our case law requires us to consider Title II, with its wide variety of applications, as an undifferentiated whole.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Whatever might be said about Title II\xe2\x80\x99s other applications, the question presented in this case is not whether Congress can validly subject the States to private suits for money damages for failing to provide reasonable access to hockey rinks, or even to voting booths, but whether Congress had the power under \xc2\xa75 to enforce the constitutional right of access to the courts.  Because we find that Title II unquestionably is valid \xc2\xa75 legislation as it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services, we need go no further.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 26 (1960).[<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Congress\xe2\x80\x99 chosen remedy for the pattern of exclusion and discrimination described above, Title II\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of program accessibility, is congruent and proportional to its object of enforcing the right of access to the courts.  The unequal treatment of disabled persons in the administration of judicial services has a long history, and has persisted despite several legislative efforts to remedy the problem of disability discrimination.  Faced with considerable evidence of the shortcomings of previous legislative responses, Congress was justified in concluding that this \xe2\x80\x9cdifficult and intractable proble[m]\xe2\x80\x9d warranted \xe2\x80\x9cadded prophylactic measures in response.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hibbs,</em> 538 U. S., at 737 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remedy Congress chose is nevertheless a limited one.  Recognizing that failure to accommodate persons with disabilities will often have the same practical effect as outright exclusion, Congress required the States to take reasonable measures to remove architectural and other barriers to accessibility.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712131(2).  But Title II does not require States to employ any and all means to make judicial services accessible to persons with disabilities, and it does not require States to compromise their essential eligibility criteria for public programs.  It requires only \xe2\x80\x9creasonable modifications\xe2\x80\x9d that would not fundamentally alter the nature of the service provided, and only when the individual seeking modification is otherwise eligible for the service.  <em>Ibid</em>.  As Title II\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations make clear, the reasonable modification requirement can be satisfied in a number of ways.  In the case of facilities built or altered after 1992, the regulations require compliance with specific architectural accessibility standards.  28 CFR \xc2\xa735.151 (2003).  But in the case of older facilities, for which structural change is likely to be more difficult, a public entity may comply with Title II by adopting a variety of less costly measures, including relocating services to alternative, accessible sites and assigning aides to assist persons with disabilities in accessing services.  \xc2\xa735.150(b)(1).  Only if these measures are ineffective in achieving accessibility is the public entity required to make reasonable structural changes.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And in no event is the entity required to undertake measures that would impose an undue financial or administrative burden, threaten historic preservation interests, or effect a fundamental alteration in the nature of the service.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa735.150(a)(2), (a)(3).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This duty to accommodate is perfectly consistent with the well-established due process principle that, \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the limits of practicability, a State must afford to all individuals a meaningful opportunity to be heard\xe2\x80\x9d in its courts.  <em>Boddie, </em>401 U. S., at 379 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).[<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Our cases have recognized a number of affirmative obligations that flow from this principle: the duty to waive filing fees in certain family-law and criminal cases,[<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] the duty to provide transcripts to criminal defendants seeking review of their convictions,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>] and the duty to provide counsel to certain criminal defendants.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  Each of these cases makes clear that ordinary considerations of cost and convenience alone cannot justify a State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide individuals with a meaningful right of access to the courts.  Judged against this backdrop, Title II\xe2\x80\x99s affirmative obligation to accommodate persons with disabilities in the administration of justice cannot be said to be \xe2\x80\x9cso out of proportion to a supposed remedial or preventive object that it cannot be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Boerne,</em> 521 U.

This argument rests on the mistaken premise that a valid exercise of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 power must always be predicated solely on evidence of constitutional violations by the States themselves.  To operate on that premise in this case would be particularly inappropriate because this case concerns the provision of judicial services, an area in which local governments are typically treated as \xe2\x80\x9carm[s] of the State\xe2\x80\x9d for Eleventh Amendment purposes, <em>Mt.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712101\xe2\x80\x9312213, is a measure expected to advance equal-citizenship stature for persons with disabilities.  See Bagenstos, Subordination, Stigma, and \xe2\x80\x9cDisability,\xe2\x80\x9d 86 Va. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 397, 471 (2000) (ADA aims both to \xe2\x80\x9cguarante[e] a baseline of equal citizenship by protecting against stigma and systematic exclusion from public and private opportunities, and [to] protec[t] society against the loss of valuable talents\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion relates, see <em>ante</em>, at 5, the Act comprises three parts, prohibiting discrimination in employment (Title I), public services, programs, and activities (Title II), and public accommodations (Title III).  This case concerns Title II, which controls the conduct of administrators of public undertakings.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Including individuals with disabilities among people who count in composing \xe2\x80\x9cWe the People,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress understood in shaping the ADA, would sometimes require not blindfolded equality, but responsiveness to difference; not indifference, but accommodation.  Central to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s primary objective, Congress extended the statute\xe2\x80\x99s range to reach all government activities, \xc2\xa712132 (Title II), and required \xe2\x80\x9creasonable modifications to [public actors\xe2\x80\x99] rules, policies, or practices,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712131(2)\xe2\x80\x9312132 (Title II).  See also \xc2\xa712112(b)(5) (defining discrimination to include the failure to provide \xe2\x80\x9creasonable accommodations\xe2\x80\x9d) (Title I); \xc2\xa712182(b)(2)(A)(ii) (requiring \xe2\x80\x9creasonable modifications in [public accommodations\xe2\x80\x99] policies, practices, or procedures\xe2\x80\x9d) (Title III); Bagenstos, <em>supra</em>, at 435 (ADA supporters sought \xe2\x80\x9cto eliminate the practices that combine with physical and mental conditions to create what we call \xe2\x80\x98disability.\xe2\x80\x99  The society-wide universal access rules serve this function on the macro level, and the requirements of individualized accommodation and modification fill in the gaps on the micro level.\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Olmstead</em> v. <em>L. C., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/581/index.html">527 U. S. 581</a> (1999), this Court responded with fidelity to the ADA\xe2\x80\x99s accommodation theme when it held a State accountable for failing to provide community residential placements for people with disabilities.  The State argued in <em>Olmstead</em> that it had acted impartially, for it provided no community placements for individuals without disabilities.  <em>Id</em>., at 598.  Congress, the Court observed, advanced in the ADA \xe2\x80\x9ca more comprehensive view of the concept of discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., one that embraced failures to provide \xe2\x80\x9creasonable accommodations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 601.  The Court today is similarly faithful to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s demand for reasonable accommodation to secure access and avoid exclusion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Legislation calling upon all government actors to respect the dignity of individuals with disabilities is entirely compatible with our Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to federalism, properly conceived.  It seems to me not conducive to a harmonious federal system to require Congress, before it exercises authority under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment, essentially to indict each State for disregarding the equal-citizenship stature of persons with disabilities.  But see <em>post</em>, at 11 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may impose prophylactic \xc2\xa75 legislation only upon those particular States in which there has been an identified history of relevant constitutional violations.\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Nevada Dept. of Human Resources </em>v. <em>Hibbs, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/721/index.html">538 U.

Members of Congress are understandably reluctant to condemn their own States as constitutional violators, complicit in maintaining the isolated and unequal status of persons with disabilities.  I would not disarm a National Legislature for resisting an adversarial approach to lawmaking better suited to the courtroom.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion documents, see <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9318, Congress considered a body of evidence showing that in diverse parts of our Nation, and at various levels of government, persons with disabilities encounter access barriers to public facilities and services.  That record, the Court rightly holds, at least as it bears on access to courts, sufficed to warrant the barrier-lowering, dignity-respecting national solution the People\xe2\x80\x99s representatives in Congress elected to order.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961525">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSOUTER, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nTENNESSEE V.

Three generations of imbeciles are enough\xe2\x80\x9d).  Laws compelling sterilization were often accompanied by others indiscriminately requiring institutionalization, and prohibiting certain individuals with disabilities from marrying, from voting, from attending public schools, and even from appearing in public.  One administrative action along these lines was judicially sustained in part as a justified precaution against the very sight of a child with cerebral palsy, lest he \xe2\x80\x9cproduc[e] a depressing and nauseating effect\xe2\x80\x9d upon others.  <em>State ex rel.

Though those tests were not themselves in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, we held that \xc2\xa75 authorizes prophylactic legislation\xe2\x80\x94that is, \xe2\x80\x9clegislation that proscribes facially constitutional conduct,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nevada Dept. of Human Resources </em>v. <em>Hibbs, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/538/721/index.html">538 U.

But the Fourteenth Amendment, unlike the Fifteenth, is not limited to denial of the franchise and not limited to the denial of other rights on the basis of race.  In <em>City of Boerne</em> v. <em>Flores,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/index.html">521 U.

To avoid placing in congressional hands effective power to rewrite the Bill of Rights through the medium of \xc2\xa75, we formulated the \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d test for determining what legislation is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  When Congress enacts prophylactic legislation, we said, there must be \xe2\x80\x9cproportionality or congruence between the means adopted and the legitimate end to be achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  521 U.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72612 <em>et seq.</em>, which required States to provide their employees up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave (for various purposes) annually, was \xe2\x80\x9ccongruent and proportional to its remedial object [of preventing sex discrimination], and can be understood as responsive to, or designed to prevent, unconstitutional behavior.\xe2\x80\x9d  538 U. S., at 740 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I joined Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s dissent, which established (conclusively, I thought) that Congress had identified no unconstitutional state action to which the statute could conceivably be a proportional response.  And now we have today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, holding that Title II of the ADA is congruent and proportional to the remediation of constitutional violations, in the face of what seems to me a compelling demonstration of the opposite by The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I yield to the lessons of experience.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d standard, like all such flabby tests, is a standing invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policy-driven decisionmaking.  Worse still, it casts this Court in the role of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s taskmaster.  Under it, the courts (and ultimately this Court) must regularly check Congress\xe2\x80\x99s homework to make sure that it has identified sufficient constitutional violations to make its remedy congruent and proportional.  As a general matter, we are ill advised to adopt or adhere to constitutional rules that bring us into constant conflict with a coequal branch of Government.  And when conflict is unavoidable, we should not come to do battle with the United States Congress armed only with a test (\xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d) that has no demonstrable basis in the text of the Constitution and cannot objectively be shown to have been met or failed.  As I wrote for the Court in an earlier case, \xe2\x80\x9clow walls and vague distinctions will not be judicially defensible in the heat of interbranch conflict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Plaut</em> v. <em>Spendthrift Farm, Inc.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/211/index.html">514 U. S. 211</a>, 239 (1995).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would replace \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d with another test\xe2\x80\x94one that provides a clear, enforceable limitation supported by the text of \xc2\xa75.  Section 5 grants Congress the power \xe2\x80\x9cto<em> enforce</em>, by appropriate legislation,\xe2\x80\x9d the other provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment.  U. S. Const., Amdt. 14 (emphasis added).  <em>Morgan</em> notwithstanding, one does not, within any normal meaning of the term, \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d a prohibition by issuing a still broader prohibition directed to the same end.  One does not, for example, \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d a 55-mile-per-hour speed limit by imposing a 45-mile-per-hour speed limit\xe2\x80\x94even though that is indeed directed to the same end of automotive safety and will undoubtedly result in many fewer violations of the 55-mile-per-hour limit.  And one does not \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d the right of access to the courts at issue in this case, see <em>ante</em>, at 19, by requiring that disabled persons be provided access to <em>all</em> of the \xe2\x80\x9cservices, programs, or activities\xe2\x80\x9d furnished or conducted by the State, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712132.  That is simply not what the power to enforce means\xe2\x80\x94or ever meant.  The 1860 edition of Noah Webster\xe2\x80\x99s American Dictionary of the English Language,<em> </em>current when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, defined \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d as: \xe2\x80\x9cTo put in execution; to cause to take effect; as, to <em>enforce</em> the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 396.  See also J. Worcester, Dictionary of the English Language 484 (1860) (\xe2\x80\x9cTo put in force; to cause to be applied or executed; as, \xe2\x80\x98To <em>enforce</em> a law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing in \xc2\xa75 allows Congress to go <em>beyond</em> the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment to proscribe, prevent, or \xe2\x80\x9cremedy\xe2\x80\x9d conduct that does not <em>itself </em>violate any provision of the Fourteenth Amendment.  So-called \xe2\x80\x9cprophylactic legislation\xe2\x80\x9d is reinforcement rather than enforcement.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Morgan</em> asserted that this commonsense interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cwould confine the legislative power . . . to the insignificant role of abrogating only those state laws that the judicial branch was prepared to adjudge unconstitutional, or of merely informing the judgment of the judiciary by particularizing the \xe2\x80\x98majestic generalities\xe2\x80\x99 of \xc2\xa71 of the Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  384 U. S., at 648\xe2\x80\x93649.  That is not so.  One must remember \xe2\x80\x9cthat in 1866 the lower federal courts had no general jurisdiction of cases alleging a deprivation of rights secured by the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  R. Berger, Government By Judiciary 147 (2d ed. 1997).  If, just after the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified, a State had enacted a law imposing racially discriminatory literacy tests (different questions for different races) a citizen prejudiced by such a test would have had no means of asserting his constitutional right to be free of it.  Section 5 authorizes Congress to create a cause of action through which the citizen may vindicate his Fourteenth Amendment rights.  One of the first pieces of legislation passed under Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa75 power was the Ku Klux Klan Act of April 20, 1871, 17 Stat. 13, entitled \xe2\x80\x9c<em>An Act</em> <em>to enforce the Provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment</em> <em>to the Constitution of the United States, and for other Purposes.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1 of that Act, later codified as Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, authorized a cause of action against \xe2\x80\x9cany person who, under color of any law, statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State, shall subject, or cause to be subjected, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  17 Stat. 13.  Section 5 would also authorize measures that do not restrict the States\xe2\x80\x99 substantive scope of action but impose requirements directly related to the <em>facilitation</em> of \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for example, reporting requirements that would enable violations of the Fourteenth Amendment to be identified.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But what \xc2\xa75 does <em>not</em> authorize is so-called \xe2\x80\x9cprophylactic\xe2\x80\x9d measures, prohibiting primary conduct that is itself not forbidden by the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The major impediment to the approach I have suggested is <em>stare decisis</em>.  A lot of water has gone under the bridge since <em>Morgan</em>, and many important and well-accepted measures, such as the Voting Rights Act, assume the validity of <em>Morgan</em> and <em>South Carolina</em>.  As Prof. Archibald Cox put it in his Supreme Court Foreword: \xe2\x80\x9cThe etymological meaning of section 5 may favor the narrower reading.  Literally, \xe2\x80\x98to enforce\xe2\x80\x99 means to compel performance of the obligations imposed; but the linguistic argument lost much of its force once the <em>South Carolina</em> and <em>Morgan</em> cases decided that the power to enforce embraces any measure appropriate to effectuating the performance of the state\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional duty.\xe2\x80\x9d  Foreword: Constitutional Adjudication and the Promotion of Human Rights, 80 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 91, 110\xe2\x80\x93111 (1966).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However, <em>South Carolina</em> and <em>Morgan</em>, all of our later cases except <em>Hibbs</em> that give an expansive meaning to \xe2\x80\x9cenforce\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment, and all of our earlier cases that even suggest such an expansive meaning in dicta, involved congressional measures that were directed exclusively against, or were used in the particular case to remedy, <em>racial discrimination</em>.  See <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/112/index.html"></a><a href="/us/400/112/index.html">400 U.

In the <em>Slaughter-House Cases</em>, 16 Wall. 36, 81 (1873), the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first confrontation with the Fourteenth Amendment, we said the following with respect to the Equal Protection Clause:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe doubt very much whether any action of a State not directed by way of discrimination against the negroes as a class, or on account of their race, will ever be held to come within the purview of this provision.  It is so clearly a provision for that race and that emergency, that a strong case would be necessary for its application to any other.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nRacial discrimination was the practice at issue in the early cases (cited in <em>Morgan</em>) that gave such an expansive description of the effects of \xc2\xa75.  See 384 U. S., at 648 (citing <em>Ex parte Virginia</em>); 384 U. S., at 651 (citing <em>Strauder </em>v. <em>West Virginia</em>, and <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Rives</em>).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In those early days, bear in mind, the guarantee of equal protection had not been extended beyond race to sex, age, and the many other categories it now covers.  Also still to be developed were the incorporation doctrine (which holds that the Fourteenth Amendment incorporates and applies against the States the Bill of Rights, see <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Louisiana,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/145/index.html">391 U. S. 145</a>, 147\xe2\x80\x93148 (1968)) and the doctrine of so-called \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive due process\xe2\x80\x9d (which holds that the Fourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause protects unenumerated liberties, see generally <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a> (2003); <em>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</em> v. <em>Casey,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/833/index.html"></a><a href="/us/505/833/index.html">505 U. S. 833</a> (1992)).  Thus, the Fourteenth Amendment did not include the many guarantees that it now provides.  In such a seemingly limited context, it did not appear to be a massive expansion of congressional power to interpret \xc2\xa75 broadly.  Broad interpretation was particularly appropriate with regard to racial discrimination, since that was the principal evil against which the Equal Protection Clause was directed, and the principal constitutional prohibition that some of the States stubbornly ignored.  The former is still true, and the latter remained true at least as late as <em>Morgan</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When congressional regulation has not been targeted at racial discrimination, we have given narrower scope to \xc2\xa75.  In <em>Oregon</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/400/112/index.html"></a><a href="/us/400/112/index.html">400 U. S. 112</a> (1970), the Court upheld, under \xc2\xa72 of the Fifteenth Amendment, that provision of the Voting Rights Act Amendments of 1970, 84 Stat. 314, which barred literacy tests and similar voter-eligibility requirements\xe2\x80\x94classic tools of the racial discrimination in voting that the Fifteenth Amendment forbids; but found to be <em>beyond</em> the \xc2\xa75 power of the Fourteenth Amendment the provision that lowered the voting age from 21 to 18 in state elections.  See 400 U. S., at 124\xe2\x80\x93130 (opinion of Black, J.); <em>id.</em>, at 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); <em>id.</em>, at 293\xe2\x80\x93296 (Stewart, J., joined by Burger, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  A third provision, which forbade States from disqualifying voters by reason of residency requirements, was also upheld\xe2\x80\x94but only a minority of the Justices believed that \xc2\xa75 was adequate authority.  Justice Black\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in that case described exactly the line I am drawing here, suggesting that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement power is broadest when directed \xe2\x80\x9cto the goal of eliminating discrimination on account of race.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 130.  And of course the <em>results</em> reached in <em>Boerne</em>, <em>Florida Prepaid</em>, <em>Kimel</em>, <em>Morrison</em>, and <em>Garrett</em> are consistent with the narrower compass afforded congressional regulation that does not protect against or prevent racial discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, principally for reasons of <em>stare decisis</em>, I shall henceforth apply the permissive <em>McCulloch</em> standard to congressional measures designed to remedy racial discrimination by the States.  I would not, however, abandon the requirement that Congress may impose prophylactic \xc2\xa75 legislation only upon those particular States in which there has been an identified history of relevant constitutional violations.  See <em>Hibbs</em>, 538 U. S., at 741\xe2\x80\x93743 (Scalia, J., dissenting); <em>Morrison</em>, 529 U. S., at 626\xe2\x80\x93627; <em>Morgan</em>, 384 U. S., at 666\xe2\x80\x93667, 669, 670\xe2\x80\x93671 (Harlan, J., dissenting).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  I would also adhere to the requirement that the prophylactic remedy predicated upon such state violations must be directed against the States or state actors rather than the public at large.  See <em>Morrison</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 625\xe2\x80\x93626.  And I would not, of course, permit any congressional measures that violate other provisions of the Constitution.  When those requirements have been met, however, I shall leave it to Congress, under constraints no tighter than those of the Necessary and Proper Clause, to decide what measures are appropriate under \xc2\xa75 to prevent or remedy racial discrimination by the States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I shall also not subject to \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d analysis congressional action under \xc2\xa75 that is <em>not</em> directed to racial discrimination.  Rather, I shall give full effect to that action when it consists of \xe2\x80\x9cenforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, within the broad but not unlimited meaning of that term I have described above.  When it goes beyond enforcement to prophylaxis, however, I shall consider it ultra vires.  The present legislation is plainly of the latter sort.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Requiring access for disabled persons to all public buildings cannot remotely be considered a means of \xe2\x80\x9cenforcing\xe2\x80\x9d the Fourteenth Amendment.  The considerations of long accepted practice and of policy that sanctioned such distortion of language where state racial discrimination is at issue do not apply in this field of social policy far removed from the principal object of the Civil War Amendments.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe seductive plausibility of single steps in a chain of evolutionary development of a legal rule is often not perceived until a third, fourth, or fifth \xe2\x80\x98logical\xe2\x80\x99 extension occurs.  Each step, when taken, appeared a reasonable step in relation to that which preceded it, although the aggregate or end result is one that would never have been seriously considered in the first instance.  This kind of gestative propensity calls for the \xe2\x80\x98line drawing\xe2\x80\x99 familiar in the judicial, as in the legislative process: \xe2\x80\x98thus far but not beyond.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>12 200&amp;nbhyph;ft.

While the Court today pays lipservice to the \xe2\x80\x9ccongruence and proportionality\xe2\x80\x9d test, see <em>ante</em>, at 8, it applies it in a manner inconsistent with our recent precedents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Garrett, </em>we conducted the three-step inquiry first enunciated in <em>City of Boerne</em> to determine whether Title I of the ADA satisfied the congruence-and-proportionality test.  A faithful application of that test to Title II reveals that it too \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantively redefine[s],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d rather than permissibly enforces, the rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Hibbs, supra, </em>at 728.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first step is to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify with some precision the scope of the constitutional right at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Garrett, supra, </em>at 365.  This task was easy in <em>Garrett, Hibbs, Kimel, </em>and <em>City of Boerne</em> because the statutes in those cases sought to enforce only one constitutional right.  In <em>Garrett</em>, for example, the statute addressed the equal protection right of disabled persons to be free from unconstitutional employment discrimination.  <em>Garrett, supra, </em>at 365.  See also <em>Hibbs, supra</em>, at 728 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe [Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA)] aims to protect the right to be free from gender-based discrimination in the workplace\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Kimel, supra</em>, at 83 (right to be free from unconstitutional age discrimination in employment); <em>City of Boerne, supra,</em> at 529 (right of free exercise of religion).  The scope of that right, we explained, is quite limited; indeed, the Equal Protection Clause permits a State to classify on the basis of disability so long as it has a rational basis for doing so.  <em>Garrett, supra, </em>at 366\xe2\x80\x93368 (discussing <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/432/index.html">473 U. S. 432</a> (1985)); see also <em>ante</em>, at 11.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, the task of identifying the scope of the relevant constitutional protection is more difficult because Title II purports to enforce a panoply of constitutional rights of disabled persons: not only the equal protection right against irrational discrimination, but also certain rights protected by the Due Process Clause.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  However, because the Court ultimately upholds Title II \xe2\x80\x9cas it applies to the class of cases implicating the fundamental right of access to the courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 19, the proper inquiry focuses on the scope of those due process rights.  The Court cites four access-to-the-courts rights that Title II purportedly enforces: (1) the right of the criminal defendant to be present at all critical stages of the trial, <em>Faretta</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/806/index.html">422 U. S. 806</a>, 819 (1975); (2) the right of litigants to have a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to be heard\xe2\x80\x9d in judicial proceedings, <em>Boddie</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/371/index.html">401 U. S. 371</a>, 379 (1971); (3) the right of the criminal defendant to trial by a jury composed of a fair cross section of the commun-\nity, <em>Taylor</em> v. <em>Louisiana</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/419/522/index.html">419 U. S. 522</a>, 530 (1975); and (4) the public right of access to criminal proceedings, <em>Press&amp;nbhyph;Enterprise Co.</em> v. <em>Superior Court of Cal., County of Riverside,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/1/index.html">478 U. S. 1</a>, 8\xe2\x80\x9315 (1986).  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Having traced the \xe2\x80\x9cmetes and bounds\xe2\x80\x9d of the constitutional rights at issue, the next step in the congruence-and-proportionality inquiry requires us to examine whether Congress \xe2\x80\x9cidentified a history and pattern\xe2\x80\x9d of violations of these constitutional rights by the States with respect to the disabled.  <em>Garrett, </em>531 U. S., at 368.  This step is crucial to determining whether Title II is a legitimate attempt to remedy or prevent actual constitutional violations by the States or an illegitimate attempt to rewrite the constitutional provisions it purports to enforce.  Indeed, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 power is appropriately exercised <em>only</em> in response to state transgressions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  But the majority identifies nothing in the legislative record that shows Congress was responding to widespread violations of the due process rights of disabled persons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than limiting its discussion of constitutional violations to the due process rights on which it ultimately relies, the majority sets out on a wide-ranging account of societal discrimination against the disabled.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9315.  This digression recounts historical discrimination against the disabled through institutionalization laws, restrictions on marriage, voting, and public education, conditions in mental hospitals, and various other forms of unequal treatment in the administration of public programs and services.  Some of this evidence would be relevant if the Court were considering the constitutionality of the statute as a whole; but the Court rejects that approach in favor of a narrower \xe2\x80\x9cas-applied\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  We discounted much the same type of outdated, generalized evidence in <em>Garrett </em>as unsupportive of Title I\xe2\x80\x99s ban on employment discrimination.  531 U. S., at 368\xe2\x80\x93372; see also <em>City of Boerne, </em>521 U.

The evidence here is likewise irrelevant to Title II\xe2\x80\x99s purported enforcement of Due Process access-to-the-courts rights.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if it were proper to consider this broader category of evidence, much of it does not concern <em>unconstitutional</em> action by the <em>States</em>.  The bulk of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s evidence concerns discrimination by nonstate governments, rather than the States themselves.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  We have repeatedly held that such evidence is irrelevant to the inquiry whether Congress has validly abrogated Eleventh Amendment immunity, a privilege enjoyed only by the sovereign States.  <em>Garrett, supra</em>, at 368\xe2\x80\x93369; <em>Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Ed. Expense Bd.</em> v. <em>College Savings Bank, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/527/627/index.html"></a><a href="/us/527/627/index.html">527 U. S. 627</a>, 640 (1999); <em>Kimel, </em>528 U. S.<em>, </em>at 89.  Moreover, the majority today cites the same congressional task force evidence we rejected in <em>Garrett</em>.  <em>Ante</em>, at 15 (citing <em>Garrett, supra</em>, at 379 (Breyer, J., dissenting), and 531 U. S.,<em> </em>at 391\xe2\x80\x93424 (App. C to opinion of Breyer, J., dissenting) (chronicling instances of \xe2\x80\x9cunequal treatment\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9cadministration of public programs\xe2\x80\x9d)).  As in <em>Garrett</em>, this \xe2\x80\x9cunexamined, anecdotal\xe2\x80\x9d evidence does not suffice.  531 U. S., at 370.  Most of the brief anecdotes do not involve States at all, and those that do are not sufficiently detailed to determine whether the instances of \xe2\x80\x9cunequal treatment\xe2\x80\x9d were irrational, and thus unconstitutional under our decision in <em>Cleburne.  Garrett, supra</em>, at 370\xe2\x80\x93371.<em> </em>Therefore, even outside the \xe2\x80\x9caccess to the courts\xe2\x80\x9d context, the Court identifies few, if any, constitutional violations perpetrated by the States against disabled persons.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to the due process \xe2\x80\x9caccess to the courts\xe2\x80\x9d rights on which the Court ultimately relies, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to identify a pattern of actual constitutional violations by the States is even more striking.  Indeed, there is <em>nothing</em> in the legislative record or statutory findings to indicate that disabled persons were systematically denied the right to be present at criminal trials, denied the meaningful opportunity to be heard in civil cases, unconstitutionally excluded from jury service, or denied the right to attend criminal trials.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to disguise the lack of congressional documentation with a few citations to judicial decisions cannot retroactively provide support for Title II, and in any event, fails on its own terms.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Garrett, </em>531 U. S., at 368 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e examine whether <em>Congress </em>identified a history and pattern\xe2\x80\x9d of constitutional violations); <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>legislative record</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 fails to show that <em>Congress </em>did in fact identify a pattern\xe2\x80\x9d of constitutional violations) (emphases added).  Indeed, because this type of constitutional violation occurs in connection with litigation, it is particularly telling that the majority is able to identify only <em>two</em> reported cases finding that a disabled person\xe2\x80\x99s federal constitutional rights were violated.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  See <em>ante</em>, at 14, n.\xc2\xa014 (citing <em>Ferrell </em>v. <em>Estelle</em>, 568 F.\xc2\xa02d 1128, 1132\xe2\x80\x931133 (CA5), opinion withdrawn as moot, 573 F.\xc2\xa02d 867 (1978); <em>People</em> v. <em>Rivera,</em> 125 Misc. 2d 516, 528, 480 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 2d 426, 434 (Sup. Ct. 1984)).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lacking any real evidence that Congress was responding to actual due process violations, the majority relies primarily on three items to justify its decision: (1) a 1983 U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report showing that 76% of \xe2\x80\x9cpublic services and programs housed in state-owned buildings were inaccessible\xe2\x80\x9d to persons with disabilities, <em>ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316; (2) testimony before a House subcommittee regarding the \xe2\x80\x9cphysical inaccessibility\xe2\x80\x9d of local courthouses, <em>ante</em>, at 16; and (3) evidence submitted to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 designated ADA task force that purportedly contains \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous examples of the exclusion of persons with disabilities from state judicial services and programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On closer examination, however, the Civil Rights Commission\xe2\x80\x99s finding consists of a single conclusory sentence in its report, and it is far from clear that its finding even includes courthouses. The House subcommittee report, for its part, contains the testimony of <em>two</em> witnesses, neither of whom reported being denied the right to be present at constitutionally protected court proceedings.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Indeed, the witnesses\xe2\x80\x99 testimony, like the U. S. Civil Rights Commission Report, concerns only physical barriers to access, and does not address whether States either provided means to overcome those barriers or alternative locations for proceedings involving disabled persons.  Cf., n.\xc2\xa04, <em>supra</em> (describing alternative means of access offered to respondent Lane).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s description, <em>ante, </em>at 16, the report of the ADA Task Force on the Rights and Empowerment of Americans with Disabilities sounds promising.  But the report itself says nothing about any disabled person being denied access to court.  The Court thus apparently relies solely on a general citation to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s Lodging in <em>Garrett</em>, O. T. 2000, No. 99\xe2\x80\x931240 which, amidst thousands of pages, contains only a few anecdotal handwritten reports of physically inaccessible courthouses, again with no mention of whether States provided alternate means of access.  This evidence, moreover, was submitted not to Congress, but only to the task force, which itself made no findings regarding disabled persons\xe2\x80\x99 access to judicial proceedings.  Cf. <em>Garrett</em>,<em> </em>531 U. S., at 370\xe2\x80\x93371 (rejecting anecdotal task force evidence for similar reasons).  As we noted in <em>Garrett</em>, \xe2\x80\x9chad Congress truly understood this [task force] information as reflecting a pattern of unconstitutional behavior by the States, one would expect some mention of that conclusion in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s legislative findings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 371.  Yet neither the legislative findings, nor even the Committee Reports, contain a single mention of the seemingly vital topic of access to the courts.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Cf. <em>ibid.;</em> <em>Florida Prepaid, </em>527 U. S., at 641 (observing that Senate Report on Patent and Plant Variety Protection Remedy Clarification Act (Patent Remedy Act) \xe2\x80\x9ccontains no evidence that unremedied patent infringement by States had become a problem of national import\xe2\x80\x9d).  To the contrary, the Senate Report on the ADA observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll states currently mandate accessibility in newly constructed state-owned public buildings.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 101\xe2\x80\x93116, p. 92 (1989).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the anecdotal evidence and conclusory statements relied on by the majority could be properly considered, the mere existence of an architecturally \xe2\x80\x9cinaccessible\xe2\x80\x9d courthouse\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, one a disabled person cannot utilize without assistance\xe2\x80\x94does not state a constitutional violation.  A violation of due process occurs only when a person is actually denied the constitutional right to access a given  judicial proceeding.  We have never held that a person has a <em>constitutional</em> right to make his way into a courtroom without any external assistance.  Indeed, the fact that the State may need to assist an individual to attend a hearing has no bearing on whether the individual successfully exercises his due process right to be present at the proceeding.  Nor does an \xe2\x80\x9cinaccessible\xe2\x80\x9d courthouse violate the Equal Protection Clause, unless it is irrational for the State not to alter the courthouse to make it \xe2\x80\x9caccessible.\xe2\x80\x9d  But financial considerations almost always furnish a rational basis for a State to decline to make those alterations.  See <em>Garrett, </em>531 U. S.<em>, </em>at 372 (noting that it would be constitutional for an employer to \xe2\x80\x9cconserve scarce financial resources\xe2\x80\x9d by hiring employees who can use existing facilities rather than making the facilities accessible to disabled employees).  Thus, evidence regarding inaccessible courthouses, because it is not evidence of constitutional violations, provides no basis to abrogate States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign immunity.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The near-total lack of actual constitutional violations in the congressional record is reminiscent of <em>Garrett</em>, wherein we found that the same type of minimal anecdotal evidence \xe2\x80\x9cf[e]ll far short of even suggesting the pattern of unconstitutional [state action] on which \xc2\xa75 legislation must be based.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 370.  See also <em>Kimel, </em>528 U. S.<em>, </em>at 91 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 failure to uncover any significant pattern of unconstitutional discrimination here confirms that Congress had no reason to believe that broad prophylactic legislation was necessary\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Florida Prepaid, supra, </em>at 645 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe legislative record thus suggests that the Patent Remedy Act did not respond to a history of \xe2\x80\x98widespread and persisting deprivation of constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x99 of the sort Congress has faced in enacting proper prophylactic \xc2\xa75 legislation\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>City of Boerne</em>, 521 U. S., at 526)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The barren record here should likewise be fatal to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding that Title II is valid legislation enforcing due process rights that involve access to the courts.  This conclusion gains even more support when Title II\xe2\x80\x99s nonexistent record of constitutional violations is compared with legislation that we have sustained as valid \xc2\xa75 enforcement legislation.  See, <em>e.g., Hibbs, </em>538 U. S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93732 (tracing the extensive legislative record documenting States\xe2\x80\x99 gender discrimination in employment leave policies); <em>South Carolina </em>v. <em>Katzenbach</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/383/301/index.html"></a><a href="/us/383/301/index.html">383 U. S. 301</a>, 312\xe2\x80\x93313 (1966) (same with respect to racial discrimination in voting rights).  Accordingly, Title II can only be understood as a congressional attempt to \xe2\x80\x9crewrite the Fourteenth Amendment law laid down by this Court,\xe2\x80\x9d rather than a legitimate effort to remedy or prevent state violations of that Amendment.  <em>Garrett, supra, </em>at 374.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third step of our congruence-and-proportionality inquiry removes any doubt as to whether Title II is valid \xc2\xa75 legislation.  At this stage, we ask whether the rights and remedies created by Title II are congruent and proportional to the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of constitutional violations adduced by Congress.  <em>Hibbs, supra,</em> at 737\xe2\x80\x93739; <em>Garrett, supra,</em> at 372\xe2\x80\x93373.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title II provides that \xe2\x80\x9cno qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712132.  A disabled person is considered \xe2\x80\x9cqualified\xe2\x80\x9d if he \xe2\x80\x9cmeets the essential eligibility requirements\xe2\x80\x9d for the receipt of the entity\xe2\x80\x99s services or participation in the entity\xe2\x80\x99s programs, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa712131(2) (emphasis added).  The ADA\xe2\x80\x99s findings make clear that Congress believed it was attacking \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrimination\xe2\x80\x9d in all areas of public services, as well as the \xe2\x80\x9cdiscriminatory effect\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9carchitectural, transportation, and communication barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712101(a)(3), (a)(5).  In sum, Title II requires, on pain of money damages, special accommodations for disabled persons in virtually every interaction they have with the State.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cDespite subjecting States to this expansive liability,\xe2\x80\x9d the broad terms of Title II \xe2\x80\x9cd[o] nothing to limit the coverage of the Act to cases involving arguable constitutional violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Florida Prepaid, </em>527 U. S.<em>,</em> at 646.  By requiring special accommodation and the elimination of programs that have a disparate impact on the disabled, Title II prohibits far more state conduct than does the equal protection ban on irrational discrimination.  We invalidated Title I\xe2\x80\x99s similar requirements in <em>Garrett</em>, observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.

Title II fails for the same reason.   Like Title I, Title II may be laudable public policy, but it cannot be seriously disputed that it is also an attempt to legislatively \xe2\x80\x9credefine the States\xe2\x80\x99 legal obligations\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em>Kimel</em>, 528 U. S., at 88.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority, however, claims that Title II also vindicates fundamental rights protected by the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x94in addition to access to the courts\xe2\x80\x94that are subject to heightened Fourteenth Amendment scrutiny.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11 (citing <em>Dunn</em> v. <em>Blumstein,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/330/index.html">405 U. S. 330</a>, 336\xe2\x80\x93337 (1972) (voting); <em>Shapiro</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/618/index.html">394 U.

S. 535</a>, 541 (1942) (marriage and procreation)).  But Title II is not tailored to provide prophylactic protection of these rights; instead, it applies to any service, program, or activity provided by any entity.  Its provisions affect transportation, health, education, and recreation programs, among many others, all of which are accorded only rational-basis scrutiny under the Equal Protection Clause.  A requirement of accommodation for the disabled at a state-owned amusement park or sports stadium, for example, bears no permissible prophylactic relationship to enabling disabled persons to exercise their fundamental constitutional rights.  Thus, as with Title I in <em>Garrett</em>, the Patent Remedy Act in <em>Florida Prepaid</em>, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967 in <em>Kimel</em>, and the RFRA in <em>City of Boerne</em>, all of which we invalidated as attempts to substantively redefine the Fourteenth Amendment, it is unlikely \xe2\x80\x9cthat many of the [state actions] affected by [Title II] ha[ve] any likelihood of being unconstitutional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>City of Boerne, supra</em>, at 532.  Viewed as a whole, then, there is little doubt that Title II of the ADA does not validly abrogate state sovereign immunity.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority concludes that Title II\xe2\x80\x99s massive overbreadth can be cured by considering the statute only \xe2\x80\x9cas it applies to the class of cases implicating the accessibility of judicial services.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 20 (citing <em>United States</em> v. <em>Raines,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/362/17/index.html">362 U. S. 17</a>, 26 (1960)).  I have grave doubts about importing an \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d approach into the \xc2\xa75 context.  While the majority is of course correct that this Court normally only considers the application of a statute to a particular case, the proper inquiry under <em>City of Boerne </em>and its progeny is somewhat different.  In applying the congruence-and-proportionality test, we ask whether Congress has attempted to statutorily redefine the constitutional rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  This question can only be answered by measuring the breadth of a statute\xe2\x80\x99s coverage against the scope of the constitutional rights it purports to enforce and the record of violations it purports to remedy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In conducting its as-applied analysis, however, the majority posits a hypothetical statute, never enacted by Congress, that applies only to courthouses.  The effect is to rig the congruence-and-proportionality test by artificially constricting the scope of the statute to closely mirror a recognized constitutional right.  But Title II is not susceptible of being carved up in this manner; it applies indiscriminately to all \xe2\x80\x9cservices,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cprograms,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cactivities\xe2\x80\x9d of any \xe2\x80\x9cpublic entity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach is not really an assessment of whether Title II is \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate <em>legislation</em>\xe2\x80\x9d at all, U. S. Const., Amdt. 14, \xc2\xa75 (emphasis added), but a test of whether the Court can conceive of a hypothetical statute narrowly tailored enough to constitute valid prophylactic legislation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our \xc2\xa75 precedents do not support this as-applied approach.  In each case, we measured the full breadth of the statute or relevant provision that Congress enacted against the scope of the constitutional right it purported to enforce.  If we had arbitrarily constricted the scope of the statutes to match the scope of a core constitutional right, those cases might have come out differently.  In <em>Garrett</em>, for example, Title I might have been upheld \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d to irrational employment discrimination; or in <em>Florida Prepaid</em>, the Patent Remedy Act might have been upheld \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d to intentional, uncompensated patent infringements.  It is thus not surprising that the only authority cited by the majority is <em>Raines</em>, <em>supra</em>, a case decided long before we enunciated the congruence-and-proportionality test.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I fear that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s adoption of an as-applied approach eliminates any incentive for Congress to craft \xc2\xa75 legislation for the purpose of remedying or deterring actual constitutional violations.  Congress can now simply rely on the courts to sort out which hypothetical applications of an undifferentiated statute, such as Title II, may be enforced against the States.  All the while, States will be subjected to substantial litigation in a piecemeal attempt to vindicate their Eleventh Amendment rights.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s as-applied approach simply cannot be squared with either our recent precedent or the proper role of the Judiciary.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even in the limited courthouse-access context, Title II does not properly abrogate state sovereign immunity.  As demonstrated in depth above, Congress utterly failed to identify any evidence that disabled persons were denied constitutionally protected access to judicial proceedings.  Without this predicate showing, Title II, even if we were to hypothesize that it applies only to courthouses, cannot be viewed as a congruent and proportional response to state constitutional violations.  <em>Garrett</em>, 531 U. S., at 368 (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa75 authority is appropriately exercised only in response to state transgressions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even in the courthouse-access context, Title II requires substantially more than the Due Process Clause.  Title II subjects States to private lawsuits if, <em>inter alia,</em> they fail to make \xe2\x80\x9creasonable modifications\xe2\x80\x9d to fa-\ncilities, such as removing \xe2\x80\x9carchitectural \xe2\x80\xa6 barriers.\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U. S., C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712131(2), 12132.  Yet the statute is not limited to occasions when the failure to modify results, or will likely result, in an actual due process violation\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the inability of a disabled person to participate in a judicial proceeding.  Indeed, liability is triggered if an inaccessible building results in a disabled person being \xe2\x80\x9csubjected to discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a term that presumably encompasses any sort of inconvenience in accessing the facility, for whatever purpose.  \xc2\xa712132.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Boddie</em> v. <em>Connecticut,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/371/index.html"></a><a href="/us/401/371/index.html">401 U. S. 371</a> (1971), and other cases in which we held that due process requires the State to waive filing fees for indigent litigants, is unavailing.  While these cases support the principle that the State must remove financial requirements that in fact prevent an individual from exercising his constitutional rights, they certainly do not support a statute that subjects a State to liability for failing to make a vast array of special accommodations, <em>without regard for whether the failure to accommodate results in a constitutional wrong.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this respect, Title II is analogous to the Patent Remedy Act at issue in <em>Florida Prepaid.</em>  That statute subjected States to monetary liability for any act of patent infringement.  527 U. S., at 646\xe2\x80\x93647.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did nothing to limit\xe2\x80\x9d the Act\xe2\x80\x99s coverage \xe2\x80\x9cto cases involving arguable [Due Process] violations,\xe2\x80\x9d such as when the infringement was nonnegligent or uncompensated.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Similarly here, Congress has authorized private damages suits against a State for merely maintaining a courthouse that is not readily accessible to the disabled, without regard to whether a disabled person\xe2\x80\x99s due process rights are ever violated.  Accordingly, even as applied to the \xe2\x80\x9caccess to the courts\xe2\x80\x9d context, Title II\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cindiscriminate scope offends [the congruence-and-proportionality] principle,\xe2\x80\x9d particularly in light of the lack of record evidence showing that inaccessible courthouses cause actual Due Process violations.  <em>Id.,</em> at 647.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For further discussion of the propriety of this approach, see <em>infra</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>E.g., ante, </em>at 13 (citing <em>Cleburne </em>v. <em>Cleburne Living Center, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/432/index.html"></a><a href="/us/473/432/index.html">473 U.
