Cross claimed that A.\xc2\xa0S. had consented to sex in exchange for money and drugs.  Despite her avowed fear of taking the stand, A.\xc2\xa0S. testified as the State\xe2\x80\x99s primary witness at Cross\xe2\x80\x99 trial in November 1999 and was cross-examined by Cross\xe2\x80\x99 attorney.  According to the trial judge, A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was halting.  The jury found Cross not guilty of kidnaping but was unable to reach a verdict on the sexual assault charges, and the trial judge declared a mistrial.

See Exh. K, at E\xe2\x80\x9314 to E\xe2\x80\x9317, E\xe2\x80\x9321; App. to Pet. for Cert. 18a.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s investigator was assisted in the search by a police detective and a victim\xe2\x80\x99s advocate.  The detective visited A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s father\xe2\x80\x99s home once and went to A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s home\xe2\x80\x94A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s last-known residence\xe2\x80\x94on numerous occasions, approximately once every three days, at different hours of the day and night.  Exh. K, at E27 to E29, E35.  On one visit, A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s mother told the victim\xe2\x80\x99s advocate that A.\xc2\xa0S. could be staying with an ex-boyfriend in Waukegan, Illinois, 40 miles away.  Id., at E42 to E43.  The police detective visited the Waukegan address but was informed by the ex-boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s mother that she had not seen A.\xc2\xa0S. in several months and that A.\xc2\xa0S. was not staying with her or her son.  Id., at E33 to E34.  The efforts to find A.\xc2\xa0S. continued until March 28, the day of the hearing on the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  Id., at E30.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn a final visit to A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s mother on the morning of March 28, the mother informed the police detective that A.\xc2\xa0S. had called approximately two weeks earlier and had said that she did not want to testify and would not return to Chicago.  See id., at E\xe2\x80\x9330; 632 F.\xc2\xa03d 356, 359 (CA7 2011).  A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s mother told the detective that she still did not know where A.\xc2\xa0S. was or how to contact her.  Exh. K, at E30.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion and admitted A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s earlier testimony.  The trial court concluded that the State had \xe2\x80\x9cexpended efforts that go way beyond due diligence,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at E\xe2\x80\x9365, and that A.\xc2\xa0S. \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] made it impossible for anybody to find where she is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in spite of what I think are superhuman efforts to locate [her],\xe2\x80\x9d id., at E\xe2\x80\x9367.  At Cross\xe2\x80\x99 retrial, a legal intern from the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office read A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s prior, cross-examined testimony to the jury.  According to the opinion below, the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the prior testimony did not include the long pauses that occurred at the first trial, and the clerk read the transcript with a slight inflection.  See 632 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 359.  The jury acquitted Cross of aggravated sexual assault but found him guilty of two counts of criminal sexual assault.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal, the Illinois Court of Appeals agreed that A.\xc2\xa0S. was unavailable because \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is clear from her telephone conversation with her mother that she was not in the city\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9calso evident that she was in hiding and did not want to be located.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 83a.  The court found that the State had conducted a good-faith, diligent search to locate A.\xc2\xa0S., and that the trial court had properly allowed the introduction of A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s cross-examined testimony from the first trial.  The court, therefore, affirmed Cross\xe2\x80\x99 convictions and sentence.  The Supreme Court of Illinois denied Cross\xe2\x80\x99 petition for leave to appeal, and we denied Cross\xe2\x80\x99 petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCross then filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus under \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Cross argued, among other things, that the state court had unreason- ably applied clearly established Supreme Court prece-dents holding that the Confrontation Clause of the \n \nSixth Amendment precludes the admission of the prior testimony of an allegedly unavailable witness unless the prosecution made a good-faith effort to obtain the declarant\xe2\x80\x99s presence at trial.  The District Court denied Cross\xe2\x80\x99 petition, but the Seventh Circuit reversed. According to the Seventh Circuit, the Illinois Court of Appeals was unreasonable in holding that the State had made a sufficient effort to secure A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the retrial.  The Seventh Circuit stressed the importance of A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and the manner of her testimony at the first trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Barber v. Page, \n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 719 (1968)\n, we held that \xe2\x80\x9ca witness is not \xe2\x80\x98unavailable\xe2\x80\x99 for purposes of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. confrontation requirement unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 724\xe2\x80\x93725.  In Barber, we held that a witness had not been unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes because the State, which could have brought the witness to court by seeking a writ of habeas corpus ad testificandum, had \xe2\x80\x9cmade absolutely no effort to obtain [his] presence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at trial\xe2\x80\x9d apart from determining that he was serving a sentence in a federal prison.  Id., at 723; see also id., at 725.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe again addressed the question of witness unavailability in Ohio v. Roberts, \n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56 (1980)\n.  In that case, we held, the State had discharged its \xe2\x80\x9cduty of good-faith effort.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 75.  We noted that the prosecutor had spoken to the witness\xe2\x80\x99 mother, who reported that she had no knowledge of her daughter\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts and \xe2\x80\x9cknew of no way to reach [her] even in an emergency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We also noted that the State had served five subpoenas in the witness\xe2\x80\x99 name to her parents\xe2\x80\x99 residence over a 4-month period prior to the trial.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The lengths to which the prosecution must go to produce a witness,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court made clear, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is a question of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 74 (quoting California v. Green, \n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 149, \n189, n. \n22 (1970)\n (Harlan, J., concurring)).  We acknowledged that there were some additional steps that the prosecutor might have taken in an effort to find the witness, but we observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne, in hindsight, may always think of other things.\xe2\x80\x9d  448 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75.  But \xe2\x80\x9cthe great improbability that such efforts would have resulted in locating the witness, and would have led to her production at trial, neutralizes any intimation that a concept of reasonableness required their execution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 76.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the present case, the holding of the Illinois Court of Appeals that the State conducted the requisite good-faith search for A.\xc2\xa0S. did not represent an unreasonable appli- cation of our Confrontation Clause precedents.  Whether or not the state court went too far in characterizing the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s efforts as \xe2\x80\x9csuperhuman,\xe2\x80\x9d the state court identified the correct \n \nSixth Amendment standard and applied it in a reasonable manner.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Seventh Circuit found that the State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were inadequate for three main reasons.  First, the Seventh Circuit faulted the State for failing to contact \xe2\x80\x9cA.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s current boyfriend\xe2\x80\x94whom she was with just moments before the alleged assault\xe2\x80\x94or any of her other friends in the Chicago area.\xe2\x80\x9d  632 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 362.  But the record does not show that any of A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s family members or any other persons interviewed by the State provided any reason to believe that any of these individuals had information about A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Seventh Circuit criticized the State because it did not make inquiries at the cosmetology school where A.\xc2\xa0S. had once been enrolled, ibid., but the court\xe2\x80\x99s own opinion observed that the information about A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s enrollment at the cosmetology school after the mistrial was not \xe2\x80\x9cnoteworthy\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly helpful.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Since A.\xc2\xa0S. had not attended the school for some time, Exh. K, at E\xe2\x80\x9342, there is no reason to believe that anyone at the school had better information about A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s location than did the members of her family.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Seventh Circuit found that the State\xe2\x80\x99s efforts were insufficient because it had neglected to serve her with a subpoena after she expressed fear about testifying at the retrial.  A.\xc2\xa0S., however, had expressed fear about testifying at the first trial but had nevertheless appeared in court and had taken the stand.  The State represented that A.\xc2\xa0S., although fearful, had agreed to testify at the retrial as well.  632 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 362.  We have never held that the prosecution must have issued a subpoena if it wishes to prove that a witness who goes into hiding is unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes, and the issuance of a subpoena may do little good if a sexual assault witness is so fearful of an assailant that she is willing to risk his acquittal by failing to testify at trial.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs we observed in Roberts, when a witness disappears before trial, it is always possible to think of additional steps that the prosecution might have taken to secure the witness\xe2\x80\x99 presence, see 448 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 75, but the \n \nSixth Amendment does not require the prosecution to exhaust every avenue of inquiry, no matter how unpromising.  And, more to the point, the deferential standard of review set out in \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d) does not permit a federal court to overturn a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision on the question of unavailability merely because the federal court identifies additional steps that might have been taken.  Under AEDPA, if the state-court decision was reasonable, it cannot be disturbed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for a writ of certiorari and Cross\xe2\x80\x99 motion to proceed in forma pauperis are granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit is\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tReversed.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s motion does not mention the investigator\xe2\x80\x99s March 3 visit with A.\xc2\xa0S.\xe2\x80\x99s mother and brother, and the record in this case does not make entirely clear when A.\xc2\xa0S. disappeared and when the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorney actually became aware of this fact.
