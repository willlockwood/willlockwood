JACKSON<br/>\n542 U. S. ____ (2004)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">FLORA HOLLAND, WARDEN <em>v.</em> JESSIE L. JACKSON</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931200. Decided June 28, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Jessie Jackson was tried in 1987 by the State of Tennessee for the murder of James Crawley.  The State asserted that he had shot Crawley after an argument over drugs.  Its principal evidence at trial was the eyewitness testimony of Jonathan Hughes, who claimed to have been at the scene with his girlfriend Melissa Gooch when the shooting occurred.  Gooch did not testify.  The jury convicted, and respondent was sentenced to life\nimprisonment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After unsuccessfully moving for a new trial, respondent sought state postconviction relief, alleging, <em>inter alia</em>, that his trial counsel had been ineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation.  See <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  The state court held an evidentiary hearing and then denied the petition, finding that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient and that, in any event, respondent suffered no prejudice.  Respondent then filed a \xe2\x80\x9cMotion for Hearing in Nature of Motion for New Trial,\xe2\x80\x9d alleging newly discovered evidence.  He claimed for the first time\xe2\x80\x94seven years after his conviction\xe2\x80\x94that Gooch would now testify that, contrary to Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 trial testimony, she was not with Hughes on the night of the shooting.  The state court denied this motion, and respondent appealed both rulings to the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That court affirmed.  It upheld the denial of new trial, observing that respondent had already filed an earlier such motion, that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno satisfactory reason given for the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to locate this witness\xe2\x80\x9d during the seven years that had elapsed, and that the proposed testimony \xe2\x80\x9cwould serve merely to impeach Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 memory about having seen [Gooch] that night.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 88.  It also affirmed the denial of postconviction relief, noting that there had never \xe2\x80\x9cbeen any showing <em>on the record</em> of favorable testimony that would have been elicited\xe2\x80\x9d from Gooch had counsel interviewed her, and that even crediting respondent\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunsubstantiated pleading,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cit in no way rises to the level of contradicting what Hughes claims to have seen\xe2\x80\x9d respecting the shooting itself.  <em>Id.</em>, at 96\xe2\x80\x9397 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent then sought federal habeas relief, and the District Court granted the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment.  It found that there had been ineffective assistance of counsel, noting several shortcomings and opining that there was a reasonable probability of prejudice.  It observed, however, that it could grant relief only if the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim was \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  It concluded that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Strickland</em>, while erroneous, was not unreasonable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit reversed.  Although it found a number of flaws in counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance, its grant of relief under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) was based on only two specific grounds: first, that the state court had unreasonably applied <em>Strickland</em>, given that Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s statement undermined the credibility of Hughes\xe2\x80\x99 testimony; and second, that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was contrary to <em>Strickland</em> because it assessed prejudice under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard rather than a reasonable-probability standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We now grant the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari and respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion for leave to proceed <em>in forma pauperis</em>, and reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit erred in finding the state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of <em>Strickland</em> unreasonable on the basis of evidence not properly before the state court.  Although the state court had ventured that it would deny relief on the merits even taking Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s statement into account, its judgment also rested on the holding that the statement was not properly before it.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 86\xe2\x80\x9389, 95\xe2\x80\x9398.  Granting relief in disregard of this independent basis for decision was error.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d clause of \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) applies when the \xe2\x80\x9cstate court identifies the correct governing legal principle from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 413 (2000).  In this and related contexts we have made clear that whether a state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was unreasonable must be assessed in light of the record the court had before it.  See <em>Yarborough</em> v. <em>Gentry,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1/index.html">540 U. S. 1</a>, ___ (2003) <em>(per curiam)</em> (slip op., at 5) (denying relief where state court\xe2\x80\x99s application of federal law was \xe2\x80\x9csupported by the record\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Miller-El</em> v. <em>Cockrell,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/322/index.html">537 U. S. 322</a>, 348 (2003) (reasonableness of state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding assessed \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the record before the court\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Bell</em> v. <em>Cone, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/535/685/index.html">535 U. S. 685</a>, 697, n.\xc2\xa04 (2002) (declining to consider evidence not presented to state court in determining whether its decision was contrary to federal law).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the habeas statute, Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s statement could have been the subject of an evidentiary hearing by the District Court, but only if respondent was not at fault in failing to develop that evidence in state court, or (if he was at fault) if the conditions prescribed by \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) were met.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/529/420/index.html">529 U. S. 420</a>, 431\xe2\x80\x93437 (2000).  Those same restrictions apply <em>a fortiori</em> when a prisoner seeks relief based on new evidence <em>without</em> an evidentiary hearing.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cargle</em> v. <em>Mullin</em>, 317 F.\xc2\xa03d 1196, 1209 (CA10 2003), and cases cited.  Where new evidence is admitted, some Courts of Appeals have conducted <em>de novo</em> review on the theory that there is no relevant state-court determination to which one could defer.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Monroe</em> v. <em>Angelone</em>, 323 F.\xc2\xa03d 286, 297\xe2\x80\x93299, and n.\xc2\xa019 (CA4 2003).  Assuming, <em>arguendo</em>, that this analysis is correct and that it applies where, as here, the evidence does not support a new claim but merely buttresses a previously rejected one, it cannot support the Sixth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court made no finding that respondent had been diligent in pursuing Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s testimony (and thus that \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) was inapplicable) or that the limitations set forth in \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) were met.  Nor did the Sixth Circuit independently inquire into these matters; it simply ignored entirely the state court\xe2\x80\x99s independent ground for its decision, that Gooch\xe2\x80\x99s statement was not properly before it.  It is difficult to see, moreover, how respondent could claim due diligence given the 7-year delay.  He complains that his state postconviction counsel did not heed his pleas for assistance.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 65.  Attorney negligence, however, is chargeable to the client and precludes relief unless the conditions of \xc2\xa72254(e)(2) are satisfied.  See <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 439\xe2\x80\x93440; cf. <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Thompson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/722/index.html">501 U. S. 722</a>, 753\xe2\x80\x93754 (1991).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit therefore erred in finding the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision an unreasonable application of\n<em>Strickland</em>.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Circuit also erred in holding that the state court acted contrary to federal law by requiring proof of prejudice by a preponderance of the evidence rather than by a reasonable probability.  The state court began by reciting the correct <em>Strickland</em> standard:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he defendant must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 95 (quoting <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 694).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Sixth Circuit nevertheless concluded that the state court had actually applied a preponderance standard, based on three subsequent passages from its opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First was the statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n a post-conviction proceeding, the defendant has the burden of proving his allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 95.  In context, however, this statement is reasonably read as addressing the general burden of proof in postconviction proceedings with regard to factual contentions\xe2\x80\x94for example, those relating to whether defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was deficient.  Although it is possible to read it as referring also to the question whether the deficiency was prejudicial, thereby supplanting <em>Strickland</em>, such a reading would needlessly create internal inconsistency in the opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second was the statement that \xe2\x80\x9cit is asking too much that we draw the inference that the jury would not have believed Hughes at all had Melissa Gooch testified.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 96.  Although the Court of Appeals evidently thought that this passage intimated a preponderance standard, it is difficult to see why.  The quoted language does not imply any particular standard of probability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Last was the statement that respondent had \xe2\x80\x9cfailed to carry his burden of proving that the outcome of the trial would probably have been different but for those errors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 98.  We have held that such use of the unadorned word \xe2\x80\x9cprobably\xe2\x80\x9d is permissible shorthand when the complete <em>Strickland</em> standard is elsewhere recited.  See <em>Woodford</em> v. <em>Visciotti,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/537/19/index.html">537 U. S. 19</a>, 23\xe2\x80\x9324 (2002) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As we explained in <em>Visciotti</em>, \xc2\xa72254(d) requires that \xe2\x80\x9cstate-court decisions be given the benefit of the doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 24.  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eadiness to attribute error is inconsistent with the presumption that state courts know and fol-\nlow the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Sixth Circuit ignored those\nprescriptions.</p>\n<p align="left">*  *  *</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Sixth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens, Justice Souter, Justice Ginsburg, and Justice Breyer would deny the petition for a writ of certiorari.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We reject respondent\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the State failed adequately to preserve this error.
