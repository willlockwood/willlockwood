The grievance at issue here was not reported within the 5-day period. The employer therefore refused to submit the grievance to arbitration. </p><p> The union brought an action to compel arbitration in the District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. The court dismissed the action on summary judgment on the ground that the employer "did not agree to submit to arbitration grievances which on their face are untimely and to which the timeliness issue is not disputed." The court rejected the union\'s contention that the timeliness issue ought to have been submitted to the arbitrator. "To permit an arbitrator to arbitrate the issue of timeliness where there is no dispute over the facts bearing on the timeliness issue would be to waste the time of the arbitrator and of the parties," reasoned the court, "and if an arbitrator should erroneously find that this particular grievance was timely filed, the finding would be so manifestly arbitrary and capricious as to require a reviewing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1039">Page 485 U.S. 1038 , 1039</a></p><p> court to set it aside."

Livingston, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/543/case.html">376 U.S. 543</a>d 898 (1964), as requiring that the arbitrator resolve all procedural objections to arbitration so long as the subject matter of the grievance is covered by an arbitration agreement.

It was nonetheless held that the arbitrability of the grievance had to be decided by the arbitrator rather than the courts.
