In Brooks Furniture Mfg., Inc. v. Dutailier Int\xe2\x80\x99l, Inc., 393 F.\xc2\xa03d 1378 (2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit interpreted \xc2\xa7285 as authorizing fee awards only in two circumstances.

We granted certiorari to determine whether an appellate court should accord deference to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that litigation is \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless.\xe2\x80\x9d  On the basis of our opinion in Octane Fitness, LLC v.

Patent No. 5,301,105 (\xe2\x80\x99105 patent), which covers \xe2\x80\x9cutilization review\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98managed health care systems.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  687 F.\xc2\xa03d 1300, 1306 (CA Fed 2012).  Highmark Inc., a health insurance company, sued Allcare seeking a declaratory judgment that the \xe2\x80\x99105 patent was invalid and unenforceable and that, to the extent it was valid, Highmark\xe2\x80\x99s actions were not infringing it.  Allcare counterclaimed for patent infringement.  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment, and the District Court entered a final judgment of noninfringement in favor of Highmark.  The Federal Circuit affirmed.  329 Fed. Appx. 280 (2009) (per curiam).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Highmark then moved for fees under \xc2\xa7285.  The District Court granted Highmark\xe2\x80\x99s motion.  706 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 713 (ND Tex. 2010).  The court reasoned that Allcare had engaged in a pattern of \xe2\x80\x9cvexatious\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdeceitful\xe2\x80\x9d conduct throughout the litigation.  Id., at 737.  Specifically, it found that Allcare had \xe2\x80\x9cpursued this suit as part of a bigger plan to identify companies potentially infringing the \xe2\x80\x99105 patent under the guise of an informational survey, and then to force those companies to purchase a license of the \xe2\x80\x99105 patent under threat of litigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 736\xe2\x80\x93737.  And it found that Allcare had \xe2\x80\x9cmaintained infringement claims [against Highmark] well after such claims had been shown by its own experts to be without merit\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9casserted defenses it and its attorneys knew to be frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 737.  In a subsequent opinion, the District Court fixed the amount of the award at $4,694,727.40 in attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and $209,626.56 in expenses, in addition to $375,400.05 in expert fees.  2010 WL 6432945, *7 (ND Tex., Nov. 5, 2010).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Federal Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  687 F.\xc2\xa03d 1300.  It affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s exceptional-case determination with respect to the allegations that Highmark\xe2\x80\x99s system infringed one claim of the \xe2\x80\x99105 patent, id., at 1311\xe2\x80\x931313, but reversed the determination with respect to another claim of the patent, id., at 1313\xe2\x80\x931315.  In reversing the exceptional-case determination as to one claim, the court reviewed it de\xc2\xa0novo.  The court held that because the question whether litigation is \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless\xe2\x80\x9d under Brooks Furniture \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98is a question of law based on underlying mixed questions of law and fact,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d an objective-baselessness determination is reviewed on appeal \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98de\xc2\xa0novo\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cwithout deference.\xe2\x80\x9d  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1309; see also ibid., n.\xc2\xa01.  It then determined, contrary to the judgment of the District Court, that \xe2\x80\x9cAllcare\xe2\x80\x99s argument\xe2\x80\x9d as to claim construction \xe2\x80\x9cwas not \xe2\x80\x98so unreasonable that no reasonable litigant could believe it would succeed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1315.  The court further found that none of Allcare\xe2\x80\x99s conduct warranted an award of fees under the litigation-misconduct prong of Brooks Furniture.  687 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1315\xe2\x80\x931319.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Judge Mayer dissented in part, disagreeing with the view \xe2\x80\x9cthat no deference is owed to a district court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the infringement claims asserted by a litigant at trial were objectively unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1319.  He would have held that \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness is a finding of fact which may be set aside only for clear error.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Federal Circuit denied rehearing en banc, over the dissent of five judges.  701 F.\xc2\xa03d 1351 (2012).  The dissenting judges criticized the court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to adopt a de\xc2\xa0novo standard of review for the \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless\xe2\x80\x9d determination as an impermissible invasion of the province of the district court.

ICON Health &amp; Fitness, Inc., rejects the Brooks Furniture framework as unduly rigid and inconsistent with the text of \xc2\xa7285.  It holds, instead, that the word \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7285 should be interpreted in accordance with its ordinary meaning.  Ante, at 7.  An \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d case, it explains, \xe2\x80\x9cis simply one that stands out from others with respect to the substantive strength of a party\xe2\x80\x99s litigating position (considering both the governing law and the facts of the case) or the unreasonable manner in which the case was litigated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  And it instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]istrict courts may determine whether a case is \xe2\x80\x98exceptional\xe2\x80\x99 in the case-by-case exercise of their discretion, considering the totality of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  Our holding in Octane settles this case: Because \xc2\xa7285 commits the determination whether a case is \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d to the discretion of the district court, that decision is to be reviewed on appeal for abuse of discretion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Traditionally, decisions on \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of law\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9creviewable de\xc2\xa0novo,\xe2\x80\x9d decisions on \xe2\x80\x9cquestions of fact\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9creviewable for clear error,\xe2\x80\x9d and decisions on \xe2\x80\x9cmatters of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d are \xe2\x80\x9creviewable for \xe2\x80\x98abuse of discretion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Pierce v. Underwood,\n\n487 U.\xc2\xa0S. 552,\n558 (1988)\n.  For reasons we explain in Octane, the determination whether a case is \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7285 is a matter of discretion.  And as in our prior cases involving similar determinations, the exceptional-case determination is to be reviewed only for abuse of discretion.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  See Pierce, 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 559 (determinations whether a litigating position is \xe2\x80\x9csubstan-tially justified\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of fee-shifting under the Equal Access to Justice Act are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion); Cooter &amp; Gell v. Hartmarx Corp.,\n\n496 U. S. 384,\n405 (1990)\n (sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11 are to be reviewed for abuse of discretion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As in Pierce, the text of the statute \xe2\x80\x9cemphasizes the fact that the determination is for the district court,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9csuggests some deference to the district court upon appeal,\xe2\x80\x9d 487 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 559.  As in Pierce, \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of the sound administration of justice,\xe2\x80\x9d the district court \xe2\x80\x9cis better positioned\xe2\x80\x9d to decide whether a case is exceptional, id., at 559\xe2\x80\x93560, because it lives with the case over a prolonged period of time.  And as in Pierce, the question is \xe2\x80\x9cmultifarious and novel,\xe2\x80\x9d not susceptible to \xe2\x80\x9cuseful generalization\xe2\x80\x9d of the sort that de\xc2\xa0novo review provides, and \xe2\x80\x9clikely to profit from the experience that an abuse-of-discretion rule will permit to develop,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 562.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We therefore hold that an appellate court should apply an abuse-of-discretion standard in reviewing all aspects of a district court\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7285 determination.
