For the reasons stated in my dissent in Miller v. California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/15/case.html#47">413 U.S. 15, 47</a> ( 1973), I would therefore grant certiorari, and, since the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit was rendered after Orito, reverse1 </p><p> In that circumstance, I have no occasion to consider whether the other questions presented merit plenary review. See Heller v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/483/case.html#494">413 U.S. 483, 494</a> (1973) (Brennan, J., dissenting). </p><p> Finally, it appears from the petition and response that the obscenity of the disputed materials was not adjudged by applying local community standards. Based on my dissent in Hamling v. United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/87/case.html#141">418 U.S. 87, 141</a> (1974), I believe that, consistent with the Due Process Clause, petitioner must be given an opportunity to have his case decided on, and introduce evidence relevant to, the legal standard upon which his convictions have ultimately come to depend. Thus, even on its own terms, the Court should vacate the judgment below and remand for a determination whether petitioner should be afforded a new trial under local community standards. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Miller v.
