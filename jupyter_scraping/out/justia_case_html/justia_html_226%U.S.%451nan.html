Unlike the record in the <em>Preston</em> case, however, the record in this case does not contain the final judgment to which the writ of error is directed.  As we cannot assume that a judgment was in fact entered in the Supreme Court of Illinois, it results that we are without authority to exert jurisdiction.</p>\n<p><em>Writ of error dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
