In every case, the last lien given will supersede the preceding.  The last bottomry bond will ride over all that precede it, and an abandonment to a salvor will supersede every prior claim.

S. 89</a></span>-90, Mr. Justice Grier, speaking for this Court, said:</p>\n<p>"The maritime privilege or lien is adopted from the civil law, and imports a tacit hypothecation of the subject of it.  It is a <em>jus in re,</em> without actual possession or any right of possession.  It accompanies the property into the hands of a <em>bona fide</em> purchaser.  It can be executed and divested only by a proceeding <em>in rem.</em>  This sort of proceeding against personal property is unknown to the common law, and is peculiar to the process of courts of admiralty.  The foreign and other attachments of property in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="10">Page 148 U. S. 10</a></p><p> the state courts, though by analogy loosely termed \'proceedings <em>in rem,</em>\' are evidently not within the category. . . .  These principles will be found stated, and fully vindicated by authority, in the cases of <em>The Young Mechanic,</em> 2 Curtis C.C. 404, and <em>The Kiersage,</em> 2 Curtis C.C. 421."</p>\n<p>Both the decisions of Mr. Justice Curtis thus referred to depended on a statute of Maine giving in general terms a lien upon a vessel for labor performed or materials furnished in her construction or repair, without undertaking to fix the comparative precedence of such liens.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Young Mechanic,</em> after elaborate discussion of the nature of such a lien, it was held to be a <em>jus in re</em> -- a right of property in the thing itself -- existing independently of possession;</p>\n<p>"an appropriation made by the law of a particular thing as security for a debt or claim, the law creating an encumbrance thereon and vesting in the creditor what we term a special property in the thing, which subsists from the moment when the debt or claim arises, and accompanies the thing even into the hands of a purchaser. . . .  Though tacitly created by the law, and to be executed only by the aid of a court of justice, and resulting in a judicial sale, it is as really a property in the thing, as the right of a pledgee, or the lien of a bailee for work,"</p>\n<p>and is not</p>\n<p>"only a privilege to arrest the vessel for the debt, which, of itself, constitutes no encumbrance on the vessel, and becomes such only by virtue of an actual attachment."</p>\n<p>2 Curtis C.C. 406, 410-412.</p>\n<p>In <em>The Kiersage,</em> Mr. Justice Curtis held that the lien for labor and materials in the home port had precedence over a prior mortgage, and, after observing that, as he had held in <em>The Young Mechanic,</em> this lien</p>\n<p>"was, in substance, a tacit hypothecation of the vessel, as security for the debt, . . . a <em>jus in re</em> constituting an encumbrance on the property by operation of law,"</p>\n<p>he added:</p>\n<p>"And there can be no doubt that it takes effect wholly irrespective of the State of the title to the vessel.  Whether the vessel belongs to one or more persons -- whether the title has been so divided that one is a special and another a general owner -- and however it may be encumbered, the law gives the lien on the thing.  The mortgagees can have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="11">Page 148 U. S. 11</a></p><p> no claim to be preferred over the lienholder because of their priority in time, for their interest in the vessel is as much subject to the statute lien as the interest of any other party.  It is not in the power of the owner, by his voluntary act, to withdraw any part of the title from the operation of the lien.  If he could, he might altogether defeat it."</p>\n<p>2 Curtis C.C. 422-423.</p>\n<p>It was assumed in each of those cases that a lien given by the local law for building a ship stood on the same ground as a lien under the same law for repairing her.  It has since been decided, and is now settled, that a contract for building a ship, being a contract made on land and to be performed on land, is not a maritime contract, and that a lien to secure it, given by local statute, is not a maritime lien, and cannot therefore be enforced in admiralty.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/61/393/case.html">The Jefferson,</a></span></em> 20 How. 393; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/63/129/case.html">The Capitol,</a></span></em> 22 How. 129; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/532/case.html">Edwards v. Elliott,</a></span></em> 21 Wall. 532.  That fact, however, does not affect the strength of the reasoning or the justness of the conclusions of Mr. Justice Curtis as regards liens for repairs and supplies, and, in relation to such liens, his view has been generally accepted in the admiralty courts of the United States.</p>\n<p>"A maritime lien, unlike a lien at common law, may," said MR. JUSTICE FIELD, speaking for this Court,</p>\n<p>"exist without possession of the thing upon which it is asserted, either actual or constructive.  It confers, however, upon its holder such a right in the thing that he may subject it to condemnation and sale to satisfy his claim for damages. . . .  The only object of the proceedings <em>in rem</em> is to make this right, where it exists, available -- to carry it into effect.

No state legislation, therefore, can bring within the admiralty jurisdiction of the national courts a subject not maritime in its nature.  But when a right, maritime in its nature and to be enforced by process in the nature of admiralty process, has been given by the statute of a state, the admiralty courts of the United States have jurisdiction, and exclusive jurisdiction, to enforce that right according to their </p><p><a class="page-number" name="13">Page 148 U.

State laws, it is true, cannot exclude the contract for furnishing such necessaries from the domain of admiralty jurisdiction, for it is a maritime contract, and they cannot alter the limits of that jurisdiction; nor can they confer it upon the state courts, so as to enable them to proceed <em>in rem</em> for the enforcement of liens created by such state laws, for it is exclusively conferred upon the district courts of the United States.  They can only authorize the enforcement thereof by common law remedies, or such remedies as are equivalent thereto.

By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3, 4, the lien may be enforced by a petition filed in a court of record in the county where the vessel is found, within five years, but cannot be enforced "as against </p><p><a class="page-number" name="14">Page 148 U. S. 14</a></p><p> or to the prejudice of any other creditor or subsequent encumbrancer or <em>bona fide</em> purchaser" unless the petition is filed within nine months after the debt accrues or becomes due.  By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 5-8, upon the filing of the petition and of a bond from the petitioner to the owner of the vessel to prosecute the suit with effect, or, in case of failure to do so, to pay all costs and damages caused to the owner or other persons interested in the vessel by the wrongful suing out of the attachment, a writ of attachment is to issue to the sheriff to seize and keep the vessel.  By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 10, 11, notice is to be given to the owners in person, and by publication to all other persons interested, and they may intervene to protect their interests.  By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 15-17, the vessel may be delivered up to the owner, or to any other person interested, upon his giving bond or making a deposit of money.  By \xc2\xa7 19, the owner and other claimants are to file answers.  By \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 21-27, upon judgment for the petitioner, the vessel, if remaining in custody, is to be sold by the sheriff and the proceeds (deducting certain costs) are to be applied, first, to the wages due to seamen, including the master, for certain periods, and then to all other claims, filed before the distribution, on which judgment has been rendered in favor of the claimant, and to any balance due to seamen, and any remnant is to be applied first, to all other liens enforceable under the statute before distribution; second, to all mortgages or other encumbrances of the vessel by the owner, "in proportion to the interest they cover and priority;" third, to judgments at law or decrees in chancery against the owner, and any surplus to the owner.</p>\n<p>It thus appears that for all supplies or provisions furnished for the use of a vessel, or for work done and materials furnished in repairing her, in her home port, the statute gives a lien upon the vessel, to be enforced by proceedings <em>in rem</em> analogous to such proceedings in admiralty.</p>\n<p>In the present case, the district court has found and adjudged that the sums claimed by the appellants for supplies, repairs, and services were due to them, and the circuit court of appeals has stated in its certificate that for these supplies, repairs, and services there was a lien upon the vessel under the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="15">Page 148 U. S. 15</a></p><p> laws of the State of Illinois, and has certified to this Court the single question</p>\n<p>"whether a claim arising upon a vessel mortgage is to be preferred to the claim for supplies and necessaries furnished to a vessel in its home port in the State of Illinois subsequently to the date of the recording of the mortgage."</p>\n<p>It must be assumed, therefore, for the purpose of deciding this question, that all the claims of the appellants for supplies and repairs were contracted under such circumstances that a lien upon the vessel for their payment existed under the statute of Illinois, and should be enforced in admiralty by the courts of the United States against the proceeds of the vessel unless the mortgagees are entitled to priority in the distribution.</p>\n<p>An ordinary mortgage of a vessel, whether made to secure the purchase money upon the sale thereof or to raise money for general purposes, is not a maritime contract.  A court of admiralty therefore has no jurisdiction of a libel to foreclose it, or to assert either title or right of possession under it.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/58/399/case.html">The John Jay,</a></span></em> 17 How. 399; <em>The Eclipse,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/135/599/case.html">135 U.

It manifests no intention to confer upon the mortgagee any new right, or to make the mortgage a maritime contract, or the lien created thereby a maritime lien, or in any way to interfere with maritime contracts or liens or with the jurisdiction and procedure in admiralty.  The only mention of any other lien on the vessel is of a bottomry bond, in the latter part of the section, originally inserted in the form of a proviso, and with the obvious purpose of precluding the possibility of construing such a bond to be an hypothecation within the meaning of the previous clause, and therefore required to be recorded.  And, as was well observed in <em>The William T. Graves,</em> 14 Blatchford 189, 195, by Judge Johnson:</p>\n<p>"If this proviso be construed to mean that such a lien only is out of the purview of the statute, and that all other liens are postponed to that of a mortgagee, then the claims of salvors, and all those having other strictly maritime liens, would be thus postponed, to the subversion of the whole principle upon which efficacy is given to such claims, and the overthrow of the best-settled and most salutary principles of the maritime law.  Indeed, any principle upon which this statute can be expounded to give such a priority to a recorded mortgage would also extend to bills of sale and other conveyances recorded under the same law, and thus practically overthrow the whole scheme of maritime law upon the subject of maritime liens."</p>\n<p>In <em>The Lottawanna,</em> the mortgage was preferred to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="17">Page 148 U. S. 17</a></p><p> claim of the materialmen in the home port only because the latter had not recorded their lien as required by the law of the state to make it valid, and it was clearly implied in the opinion of the Court, delivered by Mr. Justice Bradley, as well as distinctly asserted in the dissenting opinion of Mr. Justice Clifford, that their lien, if valid, would take precedence of the mortgage.  21 Wall.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/558/case.html#578">88 U.

And as already stated at the outset of this opinion, the same rule was laid down in the opinion of Mr. Justice Curtis in <em>The Kiersage,</em> 2 Curtis C.C. 421, approved by this Court in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/60/82/case.html">The Yankee Blade,</a></span></em> 19 How. 82.</p>\n<p>The appellees rely on a line of cases in the courts of the United States held in Illinois, beginning with a decision of Judge Drummond in 1869, and upon similar cases in the supreme court of the state, as establishing, as a rule of property that a mortgage takes precedence of a lien for supplies afterwards furnished to a vessel in her home port under the statute of Illinois.  <em>The Grace Greenwood,</em> 2 Bissell 131 (1869); <em>The Skylark,</em> 2 Bissell 251 (1870); <em>The Kate Hinchman,</em> 6 Bissell 367 (1875), and 7 Bissell 238 (1876); <em>The Great West No. 2 v.

Upon such a question, neither the decisions of the highest court of a state nor those of the circuit and district courts of the United States can relieve this Court from the duty of exercising its own judgment.  <em>Liverpool Steam Co. v.

A. Travis,</em> 7 Chicago Legal News 275, and it appears to prevail in every other judicial circuit of the United States. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 148 U.

Graves,</em> 8 Benedict 568 (1876), and (1877) 14 Blatchford 189; in the Third Circuit, by Judge McCandless, and by Mr. Justice Grier on appeal in <em>The Collier,</em> 2 Pittsburgh Rep. 304, 318-320 (1861), and by Judge Acheson in <em>The Venture,</em> 26 F. 285 (1885), and in the Fourth Circuit by Judge Hughes in <em>The Raleigh,</em> 2 Hughes 44 (1876), and by Judge Seymour in <em>Clyde v. Steam Transportation Co.,</em> 36 F. 501 (1888).  <em>In The Marcelia Ann,</em> 34 F. 142 (1887), Judge Bond gave priority to the mortgage because the statute of Maryland expressly so provided.</p>\n<p>In the Fifth Circuit, Mr. Justice Woods, then circuit judge, while admitting that the lien of a mortgage duly recorded was inferior to all strictly maritime liens, yet held that it was superior to any subsequent lien for supplies in the home port, given by the legislation of a state.  <em>The John T. Moore,</em> 3 Woods 61 (1877); <em>The Bradish Johnson,</em> 3 Woods 582 (1878).  His ruling was followed by Judge Hill, who had previously decided otherwise in <em>The Emma,</em> 3 Central Law Journal 285 (1876); and, with much doubt of its soundness, by Judge Pardee, <em>The Josephine Spangler,</em> 9 F. 773, and 11 F. 440 (1881); <em>The De Smet,</em> 10 F. 483 (1881).  But in a very recent case, Mr. Justice Lamar, upon full consideration and with the concurrence of Judge Pardee, overruled those decisions in a clear and convincing opinion.  <em>The Madrid,</em> 40 F. 677 (1889).</p>\n<p>In the Sixth Circuit, Judge Sherman, sitting in bankruptcy, held that a mortgage must be preferred to a subsequent lien for supplies under a state statute.  <em>Scott\'s Case,</em> 1 Abbott (U.S.) 336 (1869).  But the opposite rule has since been recognized as clearly established in admiralty in that circuit by decisions of Judge Withey in <em>The St. Joseph,</em> Brown Adm. 202 (1869), and <em>The Alice Getty,</em> 2 Flip. 18 (1877); of Judge Hammond in <em>The Illinois,</em> 2 Flip. 383, 433 (1879); of Mr. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 148 U.

Each rests upon the furnishing of supplies to the ship on the credit of the ship herself, to preserve her existence and secure her usefulness for the benefit of all having any title or interest in her.  Each creates a <em>jus in re,</em> a right of property in the vessel, existing independently of possession, and arising as soon as the contract is made, and before the institution of judicial proceedings to enforce it.  The contract in each case is maritime, and the lien which the law gives to secure it is maritime in its nature, and is enforced in admiralty by reason of its maritime nature only.  The mortgage, on the other hand, is not a maritime contract, and constitutes no maritime lien, and the mortgagee can only share in the proceeds in the registry after all maritime liens have been satisfied.</p>\n<p>It would seem to follow that any priority given by the statute of a state, or by decisions at common law or in equity, is immaterial, and that the admiralty courts of the United States, enforcing the lien because it is maritime in its nature, arising upon a maritime contract, must give it the rank to which it is entitled by the principles of the maritime and admiralty law. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 148 U. S. 20</a></p><p></p>\n<p>As was forcibly said by Mr. Justice Matthews in <em>The Guiding Star,</em> above cited:</p>\n<p>"In enforcing the statutory lien in maritime causes, admiralty courts do not adopt the statute itself, or the construction placed upon it by courts of common law or of equity, when they apply it.  Everything required by the statute as a condition on which the lien arises and vests must, of course, be regarded by courts of admiralty, for they can only act in enforcing a lien when the statute has, according to its terms, conferred it; but beyond that, the statute, as such, does not furnish the rule for governing the decision of the cause in admiralty as between conflicting claims and liens.  The maritime law treats the lien, because conferred upon a maritime contract by the statute, as if it had been conferred by itself, and consequently upon the same footing as all maritime liens, the order of payment between them being determinable upon its own principles."</p>\n<p>18 F. 268.</p>\n<p>It is unnecessary, however, in this case to dwell upon that consideration, inasmuch as the lien in question is given precedence over mortgages by the express terms of the statute of Illinois as well as by the principles of the maritime law and the practice in admiralty.</p>\n<p>The decisions in the Privy Council of England in <em>The Two Ellens,</em> L.R. 4 P.C. 161, and <em>The Rio Tinto,</em> L.R. 9 App.Cas. 356, cited by the appellees, in which the claims of prior mortgagees were preferred to claims of materialmen in the home port, cannot affect our conclusion.  Those decisions proceeded upon the ground that the materialmen had no <em>jus in re,</em> because there was, by the law of England, no maritime lien for supplies, and because the acts of Parliament were construed as having given no lien for them until the arrest of the ship by admiralty process.  The essential difference, in its very nature, between the right of materialmen in a court of admiralty under the law and statutes of England as judicially declared and expounded and their right by virtue of a local statute giving a maritime lien and a <em>jus in re</em> as recognized in our own jurisprudence is yet more clearly brought out in a later case, in which the Court of Appeal and the House of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 148 U. S. 21</a></p><p> Lords held that, even for supplies furnished in an English port to a foreign vessel, there was no lien, but a mere right to seize her upon process in admiralty.  <em>The Heinrich Bjorn,</em> 10 P.D. 44, and L.R. 11 App.Cas. 270.</p>\n<p>No question as to the lien of the master, or as to the comparative rank of various maritime liens <em>inter sese,</em> is presented by this case, in which the only question certified by the circuit court of appeals, or within our jurisdiction to consider, as the case stands, is whether a claim arising under a mortgage of the vessel is to be preferred to the claim for supplies and necessaries furnished in her home port in the State of Illinois since the mortgage was recorded.  This question must, for the reasons above stated, be</p>\n<p><em>Answered in the negative.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
