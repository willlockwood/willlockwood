In each case the debtors were in arrears on a long-term promissory note assigned to respondent William J. Wade, trustee (hereinafter respondent). The notes allowed a $5 charge for each missed payment but did not provide for interest on arrearages. Payment on the notes was secured by a first mortgage on the principal residence owned by each pair of debtors. The mortgage instruments provided that in the event of a default by the debtors, the holder of the note (now respondent as assignee) had the right to declare the remainder of indebtedness due and payable and to foreclose on the property. Because the value of the residence owned by each pair of debtors exceeded the outstanding balance on the corresponding notes, respondent was an oversecured creditor.</p><p>In their Chapter 13 plans the debtors proposed to pay directly to respondent all future payments of principal and interest due on the notes. The plans also provided that the debtors would cure the default on the mortgages by paying off the arrearages, without interest, over the terms of the plans. Respondent objected to each plan, on the ground that he was entitled to attorney\'s fees and interest on the arrearages. The Bankruptcy Court overruled respondent\'s objections, and respondent appealed to the District Court for the Northern District of Oklahoma, which consolidated the</p><p>1 Because the Hannons did not join the petition for certiorari, they are respondents in this Court under this Court\'s Rule 12.4.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="467">467</a></p><p>cases and affirmed. The District Court held that the Chapter 13 provisions relating to the "curing of defaults"-l1 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1322(b)(2) and 1322(b)(5)-"do not alter the contract between the parties governing such matters as interest, if any, to be paid on arrearage," and that allowing interest on arrearages would be "improper," since the notes did not provide for it.

Some courts have construed the "cure" and "modification" provisions of \xc2\xa7 1322(b) so broadly as to render \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 506(b) and 1325(a)(5) inapplicable to the curing of defaults on home mortgages. <i>E. g., Landmark Financial Services </i>v. <i>Hall, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/918/1150/">918 F.2d 1150</a>, 1153-1155 (CA4 1990).

This generally involves a determination of an appropriate discount rate and a discounting of the stream of deferred payments back to the present dollar value of the claim at confirmation. See 5 Collier, 1325.06[4][b][iii][B]. Because the issue is not presented in this case, we express no view on the appropriate rate of interest that debtors must pay on arrearages cured pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1322(b)(5).</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="473">473</a></p><p>Petitioners\' interpretation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1322(b) and 1325(a)(5) is refuted by the plain language of the Code. Section 1325(a)(5) applies by its terms to "each allowed secured claim provided for by the plan." The most natural reading of the phrase to "provid[e] for by the plan" is to "make a provision for" or "stipulate to" something in a plan. See, <i>e. </i>g., American Heritage Dictionary 1053 (10th ed. 1981) ("provide for" defined as "to make a stipulation or condition"). Petitioners\' plans clearly "provided for" respondent\'s home mortgage claims by establishing repayment schedules for the satisfaction of the arrearages portion of those claims. As authorized by \xc2\xa7 1322(b)(5), the plans essentially split each of respondent\'s secured claims into two separate claims-the underlying debt and the arrearages. While payments of principal and interest on the underlying debts were simply "maintained" according to the terms of the mortgage documents during the pendency of petitioners\' cases, each plan treated the arrearages as a distinct claim to be paid off within the life of the plan pursuant to repayment schedules established by the plans. Thus, the arrearages, which are a part of respondent\'s home mortgage claims, were "provided for" by the plans, and respondent is entitled to interest on them under \xc2\xa7 1325(a)(5)(B)(ii).9</p><p>9 Petitioners\' argument that "modified" claims cannot include home mortgage claims that have been "cured" does not withstand scrutiny. When a plan cures a default and reinstates payments on a claim, the creditor\'s contractual rights arising from the default-which in this case included the right to declare all payments due and payable, accelerate the debt, possess the property, collect rents generated by the property, and foreclose on the property, see App. 14-15, 29-30-are abrogated and therefore "modified." These modifications are allowed under \xc2\xa7 1322 (b)(5) "notwithstanding" the fact that \xc2\xa7 1322(b)(2) generally prohibits the modification of the rights of home mortgage holders. Petitioners\' construction of \xc2\xa7 1322(b)(2) also leads to the incongruous result that only home mortgage claims would be denied the benefits of \xc2\xa7 1325(a)(5). By prohibiting modifications of the rights of holders of home mortgage claims, Congress could not have intended, in our view, to afford the holders of these claims <i>less </i>protection than the holders of other secured claims.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="474">474</a></p><p>Other provisions of Chapter 13 containing the phrase "provided for by the plan" make clear that petitioners\' plans provided for respondent\'s home mortgage claim.

S. 365</a>, 371 (1988) (statutory terms are often "clarified by the remainder of the statutory scheme-because the same terminology is used elsewhere in a context that makes [their] meaning clear, or because only one of the permissible meanings produces a substantive effect that is compatible with the rest of the law") (citation omitted). Title 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1328(a) (1988 ed., Supp. III), for example, utilizes the phrase "provided for by the plan" in dealing with the discharge of debts under Chapter 13.10 As used in \xc2\xa7 1328(a), that phrase is commonly understood to mean that a plan "makes a provision" for, "deals with," or even "refers to" a claim. See 5 Collier , 1328.01, at 1328-9. In addition, \xc2\xa7 1328(a) unmistakably contemplates that a plan "provides for" a claim when the plan cures a default and allows for the maintenance of regular payments on that claim, as authorized by \xc2\xa7 1322(b)(5). Section 1328(a) states that "all debts provided for by the plan" are dischargeable, and then lists three exceptions.ll One type of claim that is "provided for by the plan" yet excepted from discharge under \xc2\xa7 1328(a) is</p><p>10 Section 1328(a) provides:</p><p>"As soon as practicable after completion by the debtor of all payments under the plan, unless the court approves a written waiver of discharge executed by the debtor after the order for relief under this chapter, the court shall grant the debtor a discharge of all debts provided for by the plan or disallowed under section 502 of this title, except any debt-</p><p>"(1) provided for under section 1322(b)(5) of this title;</p><p>"(2) of the kind specified in paragraph (5) or (8) of section 523(a) or 523(a)(9) of this title; or</p><p>"(3) for restitution included in a sentence on the debtor\'s conviction of a crime."</p><p>11 Section 1328(a)(1) refers to "debts" rather than claims, but a debt under the Code is simply "liability on a claim." 11 U.
