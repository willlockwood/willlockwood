Clark was subsequently tried on multiple counts related to the abuse of both children.  At trial, the State introduced L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements to his teachers as evidence of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, but L.\xc2\xa0P. did not testify.  The trial court denied Clark\xe2\x80\x99s motion to exclude the statements under the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause.  A jury convicted Clark on all but one count.  The state appellate court reversed the conviction on Confrontation Clause grounds, and the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The introduction of L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements at trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.

But that does not mean that the Confrontation Clause bars every statement that satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test.  The Court has recognized that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the introduction of out-of-court statements that would have been admissible in a criminal case at the time of the founding.  See<i> Giles</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353\n\xe2\x80\x93359; <i>Crawford</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56, n.\xc2\xa06, 62.  Thus, the primary purpose test is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition for the exclusion of out-of-court statements under the Confrontation Clause.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Considering all the relevant circumstances, L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements were not testimonial.  L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence for Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  They occurred in the context of an ongoing emergency involving suspected child abuse.  L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers asked questions aimed at identifying and ending a threat.  They did not inform the child that his answers would be used to arrest or punish his abuser.  L. P. never hinted that he intended his statements to be used by the police or prosecutors.  And the conversation was informal and spontaneous.  L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s age further confirms that the statements in question were not testimonial because statements by very young children will rarely, if ever, implicate the Confrontation Clause.  As a historical matter, moreover, there is strong evidence that statements made in circumstances like these were regularly admitted at common law.  Finally, although statements to individuals other than law enforcement officers are not categorically outside the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reach, the fact that L.\xc2\xa0P. was speaking to his teachers is highly relevant.  Statements to individuals who are not principally charged with uncovering and prosecuting criminal behavior are significantly less likely to be testimonial than those given to law enforcement officers.

Mandatory reporting obligations do not convert a conversation between a concerned teacher and her student into a law enforcement mission aimed at gathering evidence for prosecution.  It is irrelevant that the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 questions and their duty to report the matter had the natural tendency to result in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  And this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause decisions do not determine whether a statement is testimonial by examining whether a jury would view the statement as the equivalent of in-court testimony.  Instead, the test is whether a statement was given with the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court\xc2\xa0substitute for trial testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bryant</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 358.

A day later, teachers discovered red marks on her 3-year-old son, and the boy identified Clark as his abuser.  The question in this case is whether the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause prohibited prosecutors from introducing those statements when the child was not available to be cross-examined.  Because neither the child nor his teachers had the primary purpose of assisting in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution, the child\xe2\x80\x99s statements do not implicate the Confrontation Clause and therefore were admissible at trial.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Darius Clark, who went by the nickname \xe2\x80\x9cDee,\xe2\x80\x9d lived in Cleveland, Ohio, with his girlfriend, T. T., and her two children: L. P., a 3-year-old boy, and A. T., an 18-month-old girl.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  Clark was also T. T.\xe2\x80\x99s pimp, and he would regularly send her on trips to Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C., to work as a prostitute.  In March 2010, T. T. went on one such trip, and she left the children in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s care.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The next day, Clark took L. P. to preschool.  In the lunchroom, one of L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers, Ramona Whitley, observed that L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s left eye appeared bloodshot.  She asked him \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[w]hat happened,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and he initially said nothing.  137 Ohio St. 3d 346, 347, 2013\xe2\x80\x93Ohio\xe2\x80\x934731, 999 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 592, 594.  Eventually, however, he told the teacher that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fell.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  When they moved into the brighter lights of a classroom, Whitley noticed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[r]ed marks, like whips of some sort,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s face.  <i>Ibid.</i>  She notified the lead teacher, Debra Jones, who asked L. P., \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Who did this?  What happened to you?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id., </i>at 348, 999 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 595.  According to Jones, L. P. \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98seemed kind of bewildered\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98said something like, Dee, Dee.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Jones asked L. P. whether Dee is \xe2\x80\x9cbig or little,\xe2\x80\x9d to which L. P. responded that \xe2\x80\x9cDee is big.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 60, 64.  Jones then brought L. P.to her supervisor, who lifted the boy\xe2\x80\x99s shirt, revealing more injuries.  Whitley called a child abuse hotline to alert authorities about the suspected abuse.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When Clark later arrived at the school, he denied responsibility for the injuries and quickly left with L. P.  The next day, a social worker found the children at Clark\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house and took them to a hospital, where a physician discovered additional injuries suggesting child abuse.  L. P. had a black eye, belt marks on his back and stomach, and bruises all over his body.  A. T. had two black eyes, a swollen hand, and a large burn on her cheek, and two pigtails had been ripped out at the roots of her hair.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A grand jury indicted Clark on five counts of felonious assault (four related to A. T. and one related to L. P.), two counts of endangering children (one for each child), and two counts of domestic violence (one for each child).  At trial, the State introduced L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements to his teachers as evidence of Clark\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, but L. P. did not testify.  Under Ohio law, children younger than 10 years old are incompetent to testify if they \xe2\x80\x9cappear incapable of receiving just impressions of the facts and transactions respecting which they are examined, or of relating them truly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ohio Rule Evid. 601(A) (Lexis 2010).  After conducting a hearing, the trial court concluded that L. P. was not competent to testify.  But under Ohio Rule of Evidence 807, which allows the admission of reliable hearsay by child abuse victims, the court ruled that L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements to his teachers bore sufficient guarantees of trustworthiness to be admitted as evidence.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Clark moved to exclude testimony about L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements under the Confrontation Clause.  The trial court denied the motion, ruling that L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s responses were not testimonial statements covered by the\n \nSixth Amendment.  The jury found Clark guilty on all counts except for one assault count related to A. T., and it sentenced him to 28 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  Clark appealed his conviction, and a state appellate court reversed on the ground that the introduction of L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s out-of-court statements violated the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In a 4-to-3 decision, the Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed.  It held that, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause decisions, L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements qualified as testimonial because the primary purpose of the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 questioning \xe2\x80\x9cwas not to deal with an existing emergency but rather to gather evidence potentially relevant to a subsequent criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  137 Ohio St. 3d, at 350, 999 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 597.  The court noted that Ohio has a \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory reporting\xe2\x80\x9d law that requires certain professionals, including preschool teachers, to report suspected child abuse to government authorities.  See <i>id.,</i> at 349\xe2\x80\x93350, 999 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 596\xe2\x80\x93597.  In the court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the teachers acted as agents of the State under the mandatory reporting law and \xe2\x80\x9csought facts concerning past criminal activity to identify the person responsible, eliciting statements that \xe2\x80\x98are functionally identical to live, in-court testimony, doing precisely what a witness does on direct examination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 355, 999 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 600 (quoting <i>Melendez-Diaz</i> v. <i>Massachusetts</i>,\n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305\n\xe2\x80\x93311 (2009); some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and we now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Confrontation Clause, which is binding on the States through the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, provides: \xe2\x80\x9cIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be confronted with the wit-nesses against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>,\n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56,\n66 (1980)\n, we interpreted the Clause to permit the admission of out-of-court statements by an unavailable witness, so long as the statements bore \xe2\x80\x9cadequate \xe2\x80\x98indicia of reliability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Such indicia are present, we held, if \xe2\x80\x9cthe evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception\xe2\x80\x9d or bears \xe2\x80\x9cparticularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36 (2004)\n, we adopted a different approach.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d under the Confrontation Clause, are those \xe2\x80\x9cwho bear testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d and we defined \xe2\x80\x9ctestimony\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 51 (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  The\n \nSixth Amendment, we concluded, prohibits the introduction of testimonial statements by a nontestifying witness, unless the witness is \xe2\x80\x9cunavailable to testify, and the defendant had had a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 54.  Applying that definition to the facts in <i>Crawford</i>, we held that statements by a witness during police questioning at the station house were testimonial and thus could not be admitted.  But our decision in <i>Crawford</i> did not offer an exhaustive definition of \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial\xe2\x80\x9d statements.  Instead, <i>Crawford</i> stated that the label \xe2\x80\x9capplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 68.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Our more recent cases have labored to flesh out what it means for a statement to be \xe2\x80\x9ctestimonial.\xe2\x80\x9d  In <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Washington</i> and <i>Hammon</i> v. <i>Indiana</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813 (2006)\n, which we decided together, we dealt with statements given to law enforcement officers by the victims of domestic abuse.  The victim in <i>Davis</i> made statements to a 911 emergency operator during and shortly after her boyfriend\xe2\x80\x99s violent attack.  In <i>Hammon</i>, the victim, after being isolated from her abusive husband, made statements to police that were memorialized in a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98battery affidavit.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 820.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We held that the statements in <i>Hammon</i> were testimonial, while the statements in <i>Davis</i> were not.  Announcing what has come to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test, we explained: \xe2\x80\x9cStatements are nontestimonial when made in the course of police interrogation under circumstances objectively indicating that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to enable police assistance to meet an ongoing emergency.  They are testimonial when the circumstances objectively indicate that there is no such ongoing emergency, and that the primary purpose of the interrogation is to establish or prove past events poten-tially relevant to later criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 822.<i> </i>Because the cases involved statements to law enforcement officers, we reserved the question whether similar statements to individuals other than law enforcement officers would raise similar issues under the Confrontation Clause.  See <i>id.,</i> at 823, n.\xc2\xa02.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Michigan</i> v. <i>Bryant</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 344 (2011)\n, we further expounded on the primary purpose test.  The inquiry, we emphasized, must consider \xe2\x80\x9call of the relevant circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 369.  And we reiterated our view in <i>Davis</i> that, when \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose of an interrogation is to respond to an \xe2\x80\x98ongoing emergency,\xe2\x80\x99 its purpose is not to create a record for trial and thus is not within the scope of the [Confrontation] Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358.  At the same time, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthere may be <i>other</i> circumstances, aside from ongoing emergencies, when a statement is not procured with a primary purpose of creating an out-of-court substitute for trial testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he existence <i>vel\xc2\xa0non</i> of an ongoing emergency is not the touchstone of the testimonial inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 374.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether an ongoing emergency exists is simply one factor .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that informs the ultimate inquiry regarding the \xe2\x80\x98primary purpose\xe2\x80\x99 of an interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 366.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">One additional factor is \xe2\x80\x9cthe informality of the situation and the interrogation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 377.  A \xe2\x80\x9cformal station-house interrogation,\xe2\x80\x9d like the questioning in <i>Crawford</i>, is more likely to provoke testimonial statements, while less formal questioning is less likely to reflect a primary purpose aimed at obtaining testimonial evidence against the accused.  <i>Id.,</i> at 366, 377.  And in determining whether a statement is testimonial, \xe2\x80\x9cstandard rules of hearsay, designed to identify some statements as reliable, will be relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 358\xe2\x80\x93359.  In the end, the question is whether, in light of all the circumstances, viewed objectively, the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the conversation was to \xe2\x80\x9ccreat[e] an out-of-court\xc2\xa0substitute for trial testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 358.  Applying these principles in <i>Bryant</i>, we held that the statements made by a dying victim about his assailant were not testimonial because the circumstances objectively indicated that the conversation was primarily aimed at quelling an ongoing emergency, not establishing evidence for the prosecution.  Because the relevant statements were made to law enforcement officers, we again declined to decide whether the same analysis applies to statements made to individuals other than the police.  See <i>id.,</i> at 357, n.\xc2\xa03.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, under our precedents, a statement cannot fall within the Confrontation Clause unless its primary purpose was testimonial.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere no such primary purpose exists, the admissibility of a statement is the concern of state and federal rules of evidence, not the Confrontation Clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 359.  But that does not mean that the Confrontation Clause bars every statement that satisfies the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose\xe2\x80\x9d test.  We have recognized that the Confrontation Clause does not prohibit the introduction of out-of-court statements that would have been admissible in a criminal case at the time of the founding.  See<i> Giles</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353\n\xe2\x80\x93359 (2008); <i>Crawford</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 56, n.\xc2\xa06, 62.  Thus, the primary purpose test is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition for the exclusion of out-of-court statements under the Confrontation Clause.  </p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In this case, we consider statements made to preschool teachers, not the police.  We are therefore presented with the question we have repeatedly reserved: whether statements to persons other than law enforcement officers are subject to the Confrontation Clause.  Because at least some statements to individuals who are not law enforcement officers could conceivably raise confrontation concerns, we decline to adopt a categorical rule excluding them from the\n \nSixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s reach.  Nevertheless, such statements are much less likely to be testimonial than statements to law enforcement officers.  And considering all the relevant circumstances here, L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements clearly were not made with the primary purpose of creating evidence for Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  Thus, their introduction at trial did not violate the Confrontation Clause.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements occurred in the context of an ongoing emergency involving suspected child abuse.  When L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers noticed his injuries, they rightly became worried that the 3-year-old was the victim of serious violence.  Because the teachers needed to know whether it was safe to release L. P. to his guardian at the end of the day, they needed to determine who might be abusing the child.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Thus, the immediate concern was to protect a vulnerable child who needed help.  Our holding in <i>Bryant</i> is instructive.  As in <i>Bryant</i>, the emergency in this case was ongoing, and the circumstances were not entirely clear.  L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers were not sure who had abused him or how best to secure his safety.  Nor were they sure whether any other children might be at risk.  As a result, their questions and L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s answers were primarily aimed at identifying and ending the threat.  Though not as harried, the conversation here was also similar to the 911 call in <i>Davis</i>.  The teachers\xe2\x80\x99 questions were meant to identify the abuser in order to protect the victim from future attacks.  Whether the teachers thought that this would be done by apprehending the abuser or by some other means is irrelevant.  And the circumstances in this case were unlike the interrogation in <i>Hammon</i>, where the police knew the identity of the assailant and questioned the victim after shielding her from potential harm.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is no indication that the primary purpose of the conversation was to gather evidence for Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  On the contrary, it is clear that the first objective was to protect L.\xc2\xa0P.  At no point did the teachers inform L.\xc2\xa0P. that his answers would be used to arrest or punish his abuser.  L. P. never hinted that he intended his statements to be used by the police or prosecutors.  And the conversation between L. P. and his teachers was informal and spontaneous.  The teachers asked L. P. about his injuries immediately upon discovering them, in the informal setting of a preschool lunchroom and classroom, and they did so precisely as any concerned citizen would talk to a child who might be the victim of abuse.  This was nothing like the formalized station-house questioning in <i>Crawford</i> or the police interrogation and battery affidavit in <i>Hammon</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s age fortifies our conclusion that the statements in question were not testimonial.  Statements by very young children will rarely, if ever, implicate the Confrontation Clause.  Few preschool students understand the details of our criminal justice system.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c[r]esearch on children\xe2\x80\x99s understanding of the legal system finds that\xe2\x80\x9d young children \xe2\x80\x9chave little understanding of prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for American Professional Society on the Abuse of Children as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7, and n. 5 (collecting sources).  And Clark does not dispute those findings.  Thus, it is extremely unlikely that a 3-year-old child in L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s position would intend his statements to be a substitute for trial testimony.  On the contrary, a young child in these circumstances would simply want the abuse to end, would want to protect other victims, or would have no discernible purpose at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As a historical matter, moreover, there is strong evidence that statements made in circumstances similar to those facing L.\xc2\xa0P. and his teachers were admissible at common law.  See  Lyon &amp; LaMagna, The History of Children\xe2\x80\x99s Hearsay: From Old Bailey to Post-<i>Davis</i>, 82 Ind. L.\xc2\xa0J. 1029, 1030 (2007); see also <i>id.,</i> at 1041\xe2\x80\x931044 (examining child rape cases from 1687 to 1788); J. Langbein, The Origins of Adversary Criminal Trial 239 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Old Bailey\xe2\x80\x9d court in 18th-century London \xe2\x80\x9ctolerated flagrant hearsay in rape prosecutions involving a child victim who was not competent to testify because she was too young to appreciate the significance of her oath\xe2\x80\x9d).  And when 18th-century courts excluded statements of this sort, see, <i>e.g., King </i>v. <i>Brasier</i>, 1 Leach 199, 168 Eng. Rep. 202 (K. B. 1779), they appeared to do so because the child should have been ruled competent to testify, not because the statements were otherwise inadmissible.  See Lyon &amp; LaMagna, <i>supra</i>, at 1053\xe2\x80\x931054.  It is thus highly doubtful that statements like L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s ever would have been understood to raise Confrontation Clause concerns.  Neither <i>Crawford</i> nor any of the cases that it has produced has mounted evidence that the adoption of the Confrontation Clause was understood to require the exclusion of evidence that was regularly admitted in criminal cases at the time of the founding.  Certainly, the statements in this case are nothing like the notorious use of <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> examination in Sir Walter Raleigh\xe2\x80\x99s trial for treason, which we have frequently identified as \xe2\x80\x9cthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Crawford</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 50; see also <i>Bryant</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 358.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, although we decline to adopt a rule that statements to individuals who are not law enforcement officers are categorically outside the\n \nSixth Amendment, the fact that L. P. was speaking to his teachers remains highly relevant.  Courts must evaluate challenged statements in context, and part of that context is the questioner\xe2\x80\x99s iden-tity.  See <i>id.</i>, at 369.  Statements made to someone who is not principally charged with uncovering and prosecuting criminal behavior are significantly less likely to be testimonial than statements given to law enforcement officers.  See, <i>e.g., Giles</i>, 554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 376.  It is common sense that the relationship between a student and his teacher is very different from that between a citizen and the police.  We do not ignore that reality.  In light of these circumstances, the\n \nSixth Amendment did not prohibit the State from introducing L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements at trial.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Clark\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to avoid this conclusion are all off-base.  He emphasizes Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory reporting obligations, in an attempt to equate L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers with the police and their caring questions with official interrogations.  But the comparison is inapt.  The teachers\xe2\x80\x99 pressing concern was to protect L. P. and remove him from harm\xe2\x80\x99s way.  Like all good teachers, they undoubtedly would have acted with the same purpose whether or not they had a state-law duty to report abuse.  And mandatory reporting statutes alone cannot convert a conversation between a concerned teacher and her student into a law enforcement mission aimed primarily at gathering evidence for a prosecution.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is irrelevant that the teachers\xe2\x80\x99 questions and their duty to report the matter had the natural tendency to result in Clark\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution.  The statements at issue in <i>Davis</i> and <i>Bryant</i> supported the defendants\xe2\x80\x99 convictions, and the police always have an obligation to ask questions to resolve ongoing emergencies.  Yet, we held in those cases that the Confrontation Clause did not prohibit introduction of the statements because they were not primarily intended to be testimonial.  Thus, Clark is also wrong to suggest that admitting L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements would be fundamentally unfair given that Ohio law does not allow incompetent children to testify.  In any Confrontation Clause case, the individual who provided the out-of-court statement is not available as an in-court witness, but the testimony is admissible under an exception to the hearsay rules and is probative of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt.  The fact that the witness is unavailable because of a different rule of evidence does not change our analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, Clark asks us to shift our focus from the context of L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s conversation with his teachers to the jury\xe2\x80\x99s perception of those statements.  Because, in his view, the \xe2\x80\x9cjury treated L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s accusation as the functional equivalent of testimony,\xe2\x80\x9d Clark argues that we must prohibit its introduction.  Brief for Respondent 42.  Our Confrontation Clause decisions, however, do not determine whether a statement is testimonial by examining whether a jury would view the statement as the equivalent of in-court testimony.  The logic of this argument, moreover, would lead to the conclusion that virtually all out-of-court statements offered by the prosecution are testimonial.  The prosecution is unlikely to offer out-of-court statements unless they tend to support the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilt, and all such statements could be viewed as a substitute for in-court testimony.  We have never suggested, however, that the Confrontation Clause bars the introduction of all out-of-court statements that support the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case.  Instead, we ask whether a statement was given with the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary purpose of creating an out-of-court\xc2\xa0substitutefor trial testimony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Bryant</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 358.

His age refutes the notion that he is capable of forming such a purpose.

The inconsistency of L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s answers\xe2\x80\x94making him incompetent to testify here\xe2\x80\x94is hardly unusual for a child of his age.  And the circumstances of L.\xc2\xa0P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements objectively indicate that even if he could, as an abstract matter, form such a purpose, he did not.  Nor did the teachers have the pri-mary purpose of establishing facts for later prosecution.  Instead, they sought to ensure that they did not deliver an abused child back into imminent harm.  Nor did the conversation have the requisite solemnity necessary for testimonial statements.  A 3-year-old was asked questions by his teachers at school.  That is far from the surroundings adequate to impress upon a declarant the importance of what he is testifying to.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is all that is necessary to decide the case, and all that today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment holds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I write separately, however, to protest the Court\xe2\x80\x99s shoveling of fresh dirt upon the\n \nSixth Amendment right of confrontation so recently rescued from the grave in <i>Crawford</i> v. <i>Washington</i>,<i> </i>\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36 (2004)\n.  For several decades before that case, we had been allowing hearsay statements to be admitted against a criminal defendant if they bore \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98indicia of reliability.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>,\n\n448 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56,\n66 (1980)\n.  Prosecutors, past and present, love that flabby test.  <i>Crawford</i> sought to bring our application of the Confrontation Clause back to its original meaning, which was to exclude unconfronted statements made by <i>witnesses</i>\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> statements that were <i>testimonial</i>.  541 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 51.  We defined testimony as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i>\xe2\x80\x94in the context of the Confrontation Clause, a fact \xe2\x80\x9cpotentially relevant to later criminal prosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813,\n822 (2006)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Crawford </i>remains the law.  But when else has the categorical overruling, the thorough repudiation, of an earlier line of cases been described as nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cadopt[ing] a different approach,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x94as though <i>Crawford</i> is only a matter of twiddle-dum twiddle-dee preference, and the old, pre-<i>Crawford</i> \xe2\x80\x9capproach\xe2\x80\x9d remains available?  The author unabashedly displays his hostility to <i>Crawford</i> and its progeny, perhaps aggravated by in-ability to muster the votes to overrule them.  <i>Crawford</i> \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not rank on the [author of the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s] top-ten list of favorite precedents\xe2\x80\x94and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the [author] could not restrain [himself] from saying (and saying and saying) so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Harris</i> v. <i>Quinn</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But snide detractions do no harm; they are just indications of motive.  Dicta on legal points, however, can do harm, because though they are not binding they can mislead.  Take, for example, the opinion\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the primary-purpose test is merely <i>one</i> of several heretofore unmentioned conditions (\xe2\x80\x9cnecessary, but not always sufficient\xe2\x80\x9d) that must be satisfied before the Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protections apply.  <i>Ante, </i>at 7.  That is absolutely false, and has no support in our opinions.  The Confrontation Clause categorically entitles a defendant <i>to be confronted with the witnesses against him</i>; and the primary-purpose test sorts out, among the many people who interact with the police informally, <i>who is acting as a witness and who is not</i>.  Those who fall into the former category bear testimony, and are therefore acting as \xe2\x80\x9cwitnesses,\xe2\x80\x9d subject to the right of confrontation.  There are no other mysterious requirements that the Court declines to name.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The opinion asserts that future defendants, and future Confrontation Clause majorities, must provide \xe2\x80\x9cevidence that the adoption of the Confrontation Clause was understood to require the exclusion of evidence that was regularly admitted in criminal cases at the time of the founding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  This dictum gets the burden precisely backwards\xe2\x80\x94which is of course precisely the idea.  Defendants may invoke their Confrontation Clause rights once they have established that the state seeks to introduce testimonial evidence against them in a criminal case without unavailability of the witness and a previous opportunity to cross-examine.  The burden is upon the prosecutor who seeks to introduce evidence <i>over</i> this bar to prove a long-established practice of introducing <i>specific</i> kinds of evidence, such as dying declarations, <i>see Crawford</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 56, n.\xc2\xa06, for which cross-examination was not typically necessary.  A suspicious mind (or even one that is merely not na\xc3\xafve) might regard this distortion as the first step in an attempt to smuggle longstanding hearsay exceptions back into the Confrontation Clause\xe2\x80\x94in other words, an attempt to return to <i>Ohio</i> v. <i>Roberts</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But the good news is that there are evidently not the votes to return to that halcyon era for prosecutors; and that dicta, even calculated dicta, are nothing but dicta.

In the decade since we first sought to return to the original meaning of the Confrontation Clause, see <i>Crawford </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36 (2004)\n, we have carefully reserved consideration of that Clause\xe2\x80\x99s application to statements made to private persons for a case in which it was squarely presented.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Michigan </i>v. <i>Bryant</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 344\n, n.\xc2\xa03 (2011).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This is that case; yet the majority does not offer clear guidance on the subject, declaring only that \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary purpose test is a necessary, but not always sufficient, condition\xe2\x80\x9d for a statement to fall within the scope of the Confrontation Clause.  <i>Ante,</i> at 7.  The primary purpose test, however, is just as much \xe2\x80\x9can exercise in fiction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. disconnected from history\xe2\x80\x9d for statements made to private persons as it is for statements made to agents of law enforcement, if not more so.  See <i>Bryant</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 379 (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment) (internal quotation marks omitted).  I would not apply it here.  Nor would I leave the resolution of this important question in doubt.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, I would use the same test for statements to private persons that I have employed for statements to agents of law enforcement, assessing whether those statements bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to qualify as testimonial.  See <i>Crawford, supra, </i>at 51; <i>Davis </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 813\n\xe2\x80\x93837 (2006) (Thomas, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part).  This test is grounded in the history of the common-law right to confrontation, which \xe2\x80\x9cdeveloped to target particular practices that occurred under the English bail and committal statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary, namely, the civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of <i>ex\xc2\xa0parte</i> examinations as evidence against the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 835 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Reading the Confrontation Clause in light of this history, we have interpreted the accused\xe2\x80\x99s right to confront \xe2\x80\x9cthe witnesses against him,\xe2\x80\x9d U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 6, as the right to confront those who \xe2\x80\x9cbear testi-mony\xe2\x80\x9d against him, <i>Crawford</i>, 541 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 51 (relying on the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9cwitness\xe2\x80\x9d).  And because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]estimony .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ibid.</i> (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted), an analysis of statements under the Clause must turn in part on their solemnity, <i>Davis</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 836 (opinion of Thomas, J.).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I have identified several categories of extrajudicial statements that bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to fall within the original meaning of testimony.  Statements \xe2\x80\x9ccontained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions\xe2\x80\x9d easily qualify.  <i>White </i>v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 346,\n365 (1992)\n (Thomas, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  And statements not contained in such materials may still qualify if they were obtained in \xe2\x80\x9ca formalized dialogue\xe2\x80\x9d; after the issuance of the warnings required by <i>Miranda </i>v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436 (1966)\n; while in police custody; or in an attempt to evade confrontation.  <i>Davis</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 840 (opinion of Thomas, J.); see also <i>Bryant</i>, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 379 (same) (summarizing and applying test).  That several of these factors seem inherently inapplicable to statements made to private persons does not mean that the test is unsuitable for analyzing such statements.  All it means is that statements made to private persons rarely resemble the historical abuses that the common-law right to confrontation developed to address, and it is those practices that the test is designed to identify.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements do not bear sufficient indicia of solemnity to qualify as testimonial.  They were neither contained in formalized testimonial materials nor obtained as the result of a formalized dialogue initiated by police.  Instead, they were elicited during questioning by L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s teachers at his preschool.  Nor is there any indication that L. P.\xe2\x80\x99s statements were offered at trial to evade confrontation.  To the contrary, the record suggests that the prosecution would have produced L. P. to testify had he been deemed competent to do so.  His statements bear no \xe2\x80\x9cresemblance to the historical practices that the Confrontation Clause aimed to eliminate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The admission of L.
