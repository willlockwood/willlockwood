Four years later, in <i>Payne</i> v. <i>Tennessee</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 808 (1991)\n, the Courtgranted certiorari to reconsider that ban on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98victim impact\xe2\x80\x99evidence relating to the personal characteristics of the victim and the emotional impact of the crimes on the victim\xe2\x80\x99s family.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 817.  The Court held that <i>Booth</i> was wrong to conclude that the\n \nEighth Amendment required such a ban.  <i>Payne</i>, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S. at 827.  That holding was expressly \xe2\x80\x9climited to\xe2\x80\x9d this particular type of victim impact testimony.  <i>Id.</i>, at 830, n. 2.  \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Booth</i> also held that the admission of a victim\xe2\x80\x99s family members\xe2\x80\x99 characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence violates the\n \nEighth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d but no such evidence was presented in <i>Payne</i>, so the Court had no occasion to reconsider that aspect of the decision.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has held that <i>Payne</i> \xe2\x80\x9c<i>implicitly</i> overruled that portion of <i>Booth</i> regarding characterizations of the defendant and opinions of the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Conover</i> v. <i>State</i>, 933 P. 2d 904, 920 (1997) (emphasis added); see also <i>Ledbetter</i> v. <i>State</i>, 933 P. 2d 880, 890\xe2\x80\x93891 (Okla. Crim. App. 1997).  The decision below presents a straightforward application of that interpretation of <i>Payne</i>.  A jury convicted petitioner Shaun Michael Bosse of three counts of first-degree murder for the 2010 killing of Katrina Griffin and her two children.  The State of Oklahoma sought the death penalty.  Over Bosse\xe2\x80\x99s objection, the State asked three of the victims\xe2\x80\x99 relatives to recommend a sentence to the jury.  All three recommended death, and the jury agreed.  Bosse appealed, arguing that this testimony about the appropriate sentence violated the\n \nEighth Amendment under <i>Booth</i>.  The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed his sentence, concluding that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno error.\xe2\x80\x9d  2015 OK CR 14, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 57\xe2\x80\x9358, 360 P. 3d 1203, 1226\xe2\x80\x931227.

The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals has recognized that <i>Payne</i> \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically acknowledged its holding did not affect\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Booth</i>\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate punishment.  <i>Ledbetter</i>, 933 P. 2d at 890\xe2\x80\x93891.  That should have ended its inquiry into whether the\n \nEighth Amendment bars such testimony; the court was wrong to go further and conclude that <i>Payne</i> implicitly overruled <i>Booth</i> in its entirety.  \xe2\x80\x9cOur decisions remain binding precedent until we see fit to reconsider them, regardless of whether subsequent cases have raised doubts about their continuing vitality.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hohn</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n524 U.\xc2\xa0S. 236\n\xe2\x80\x93253 (1998).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals remains bound by <i>Booth</i>\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on characterizations and opinions from a victim\xe2\x80\x99s family members about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence unless this Court reconsiders that ban.
