It is impossible to imagine a plainer case for condemnation for breach of blockade.  The statements of the captain as to breaking the blockade are explicit, and the mate says substantially the same thing as he does.</p>\n<p>We cannot approve the conduct of the counsel who advised this appeal.  An appeal is a matter of right, and, if prayed, must be allowed, but should never be prayed without some expectation of reversal.  We impose penalties when writs of error merely for delay are sued out, in cases of judgments at law for damages; and if the rule were applicable to the case before us we should apply it.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
