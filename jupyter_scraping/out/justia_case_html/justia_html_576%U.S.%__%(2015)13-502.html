The Church was cited for exceeding the time limits for displaying temporary directional signs and for failing to include an event date on the signs.  Unable to reach an accommodation with the Town, petitioners filed suit, claiming that the Code abridged their freedom of speech.  The District Court denied their motion for a preliminary injunction, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, ultimately concluding that the Code\xe2\x80\x99s sign categories were content neutral, and that the Code satisfied the intermediate scrutiny accorded to content-neutral regulations of speech.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s provisions are content-based regulations of speech that do not survive strict scrutiny.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Because content-based laws target speech based on its communicative content, they are presumptively unconstitutional and may be justified only if the government proves that they are narrowly tailored to serve compelling state interests.  <i>E.g., R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</i> v. <i>St. Paul</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n.  Speech regulation is content based if a law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.  <i>E.g., Sorrell </i>v. <i>IMS Health, Inc.</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___.  And courts are required to consider whether a regulation of speech \xe2\x80\x9con its face\xe2\x80\x9d draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.  <i>Id., </i>at ___.  Whether laws define regulated speech by particular subject matter or by its function or purpose, they are subject to strict scrutiny.  The same is true for laws that, though facially content neutral, cannot be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or were adopted by the government \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of disagreement with the message\xe2\x80\x9d conveyed.  <i>Ward</i> v. <i>Rock Against Racism</i>,\n\n491 U.\xc2\xa0S. 781\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The Sign Code is content based on its face.  It defines the categories of temporary, political, and ideological signs on the basis of their messages and then subjects each category to different restrictions.  The restrictions applied thus depend entirely on the sign\xe2\x80\x99s communicative content.  Because the Code, on its face, is a content-based regulation of speech, there is no need to consider the government\xe2\x80\x99s justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.  Pp.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0None of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s theories for its contrary holding is persuasive.  Its conclusion that the Town\xe2\x80\x99s regulation was not based on a disagreement with the message conveyed skips the crucial first step in the content-neutrality analysis: determining whether the law is content neutral on its face.  A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government\xe2\x80\x99s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of \xe2\x80\x9canimus toward the ideas contained\xe2\x80\x9d in the regulated speech.  <i>Cincinnati </i>v. <i>Discovery Network</i>, <i>Inc.,</i>\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410\n.  Thus, an innocuous justification cannot transform a facially content-based law into one that is content neutral.  A court must evaluate each question\xe2\x80\x94whether a law is content based on its face and whether the purpose and justification for the law are content based\xe2\x80\x94before concluding that a law is content neutral.  <i>Ward </i>does not require otherwise, for its framework applies only to a content-neutral statute.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Sign Code does not single out any idea or viewpoint for discrimination conflates two distinct but related limitations that the\n \nFirst Amendment places on government regulation of speech.  Government discrimination among viewpoints is a \xe2\x80\x9cmore blatant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cegregious form of content discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819\n, but \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s hostility to content-based regulation [also] extends .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530\n.  The Sign Code, a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination, singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The Ninth Circuit also erred in concluding that the Sign Code was not content based because it made only speaker-based and event-based distinctions.  The Code\xe2\x80\x99s categories are not speaker-based\xe2\x80\x94the restrictions for political, ideological, and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them.  And even if the sign categories were speaker based, that would not automatically render the law content neutral.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9claws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s speaker preference reflects a content preference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622\n.  This same analysis applies to event-based distinctions.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(d)\xc2\xa0The Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s content-based restrictions do not survive strict scrutiny because the Town has not demonstrated that the Code\xe2\x80\x99s differentiation between temporary directional signs and other types of signs furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.  See<i> Arizona Free Enterprise Club\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom Club PAC </i>v. <i>Bennett</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  Assuming that the Town has a compelling interest in preserving its aesthetic appeal and traffic safety, the Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions are highly underinclusive.  The Town cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to beautify the Town when other types of signs create the same problem.  See <i>Discovery Network</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 425.  Nor has it shown that temporary directional signs pose a greater threat to public safety than ideological or political signs.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(e)\xc2\xa0This decision will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws.  The Town has ample content-neutral options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics, including regulating size, building materials, lighting, moving parts, and portability.  And the Town may be able to forbid postings on public property, so long as it does so in an evenhanded, content-neutral manner.  See <i>Members of City Council of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Taxpayers for Vincent</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 789\n.  An ordinance narrowly tailored to the challenges of protecting the safety of pedestrians, drivers, and passengers\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.,</i> warning signs marking hazards on private property or signs directing traffic\xe2\x80\x94might also survive strict scrutiny.

Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code (Sign Code or Code), ch. 1, \xc2\xa74.402 (2005).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The Sign Code identifies various categories of signs based on the type of information they convey, then subjects each category to different restrictions.  One of the categories is \xe2\x80\x9cTemporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event,\xe2\x80\x9d loosely defined as signs directing the public to a meeting of a nonprofit group.  \xc2\xa74.402(P).  The Code imposes more stringent restrictions on these signs than it doeson signs conveying other messages.  We hold that these provisions are content-based regulations of speech that cannot survive strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Sign Code prohibits the display of outdoor signs anywhere within the Town without a permit, but it then exempts 23 categories of signs from that requirement.  These exemptions include everything from bazaar signs to flying banners.  Three categories of exempt signs are particularly relevant here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The first is \xe2\x80\x9cIdeological Sign[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  This category includes any \xe2\x80\x9csign communicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes that is not a Construction Sign, Directional Sign, Temporary Directional Sign Relating to a Qualifying Event, Political Sign, Garage Sale Sign, or a sign owned or required by a governmental agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  Sign Code, Glossary of General Terms (Glossary), p. 23 (emphasis deleted).  Of the three categories discussed here, the Code treats ideological signs most favorably, allowing them to be up to 20 square feet in area and to be placed in all \xe2\x80\x9czoning districts\xe2\x80\x9d without time limits.  \xc2\xa74.402(J).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second category is \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical Sign[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  This includes any \xe2\x80\x9ctemporary sign designed to influence the outcome of an election called by a public body.\xe2\x80\x9d  Glossary 23.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The Code treats these signs less favorably than ideological signs.  The Code allows the placement of political signs up to 16 square feet on residential property and up to 32 square feet on nonresidential property, undeveloped municipal property, and \xe2\x80\x9crights-of-way.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa74.402(I).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  These signs may be displayed up to 60 days before a primary election and up to 15 days following a general election.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The third category is \xe2\x80\x9cTemporary Directional Signs Relating to a Qualifying Event.\xe2\x80\x9d  This includes any \xe2\x80\x9cTemporary Sign intended to direct pedestrians, motorists, and other passersby to a \xe2\x80\x98qualifying event.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Glossary 25 (emphasis deleted).  A \xe2\x80\x9cqualifying event\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as any \xe2\x80\x9cassembly, gathering, activity, or meeting sponsored, arranged, or promoted by a religious, charitable, community service, educational, or other similar non-profit organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The Code treats temporary directional signs even less favorably than political signs.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Temporary directional signs may be no larger than six square feet.  \xc2\xa74.402(P).  They may be placed on private property or on a public right-of-way, but no more than four signs may be placed on a single property at any time.  <i>Ibid</i>.  And, they may be displayed no more than 12 hours before the \xe2\x80\x9cqualifying event\xe2\x80\x9d and no more than 1 hour afterward.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioners Good News Community Church (Church) and its pastor, Clyde Reed, wish to advertise the time and location of their Sunday church services.  The Church is a small, cash-strapped entity that owns no building, so it holds its services at elementary schools or other locations in or near the Town.  In order to inform the public about its services, which are held in a variety of different locations, the Church began placing 15 to 20 temporary signs around the Town, frequently in the public right-of-way abutting the street.  The signs typically displayed the Church\xe2\x80\x99s name, along with the time and location of the upcoming service.  Church members would post the signs early in the day on Saturday and then remove them around midday on Sunday.  The display of these signs requires little money and manpower, and thus has proved to be an economical and effective way for the Church to let the community know where its services are being held each week.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This practice caught the attention of the Town\xe2\x80\x99s Sign Code compliance manager, who twice cited the Church for violating the Code.  The first citation noted that the Church exceeded the time limits for displaying its temporary directional signs.  The second citation referred to the same problem, along with the Church\xe2\x80\x99s failure to include the date of the event on the signs.  Town officials even confiscated one of the Church\xe2\x80\x99s signs, which Reed had to retrieve from the municipal offices.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Reed contacted the Sign Code Compliance Department in an attempt to reach an accommodation.  His efforts proved unsuccessful.  The Town\xe2\x80\x99s Code compliance manager informed the Church that there would be \xe2\x80\x9cno leni-ency under the Code\xe2\x80\x9d and promised to punish any futureviolations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Shortly thereafter, petitioners filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona, arguing that the Sign Code abridged their freedom of speech in violation of the First and\n \nFourteenth Amendments.  The District Court denied the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion for a preliminary injunction.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s provision regulating temporary directional signs did not regulate speech on the basis of content.  587 F.\xc2\xa03d 966, 979 (2009).  It reasoned that, even though an enforcement officer would have to read the sign to determine what provisions of the Sign Code applied to it, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98kind of cursory examination\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that would be necessary for an officer to classify it as a temporary directional sign was \xe2\x80\x9cnot akin to an officer synthesizing the expressive content of the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 978.  It then remanded for the District Court to determine in the first instance whether the Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions among temporary directional signs, political signs, and ideological signs nevertheless constituted a content-based regulation of speech.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On remand, the District Court granted summary judgment in favor of the Town.  The Court of Appeals again affirmed, holding that the Code\xe2\x80\x99s sign categories were content neutral.  The court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe distinctions between Temporary Directional Signs, Ideological Signs, and Political Signs .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. are based on objective factors relevant to Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s creation of the specific exemption from the permit requirement and do not otherwise consider the substance of the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d  707 F.\xc2\xa03d 1057, 1069 (CA9 2013).  Relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Hill </i>v. <i>Colorado</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 703 (2000)\n, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Sign Code is content neutral.  707 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1071\xe2\x80\x931072.  As the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cGilbert did not adopt its regulation of speech because it disagreed with the message conveyed\xe2\x80\x9d and its \xe2\x80\x9cinterests in regulat[ing] temporary signs are unrelated to the content of the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Accord-ingly, the court believed that the Code was \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-neutral as that term [has been] defined by the Supreme Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1071.  In light of that determination, it applied a lower level of scrutiny to the Sign Code and concluded that the law did not violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.  <i>Id.</i>, at 1073\xe2\x80\x931076.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), and now reverse.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The\n \nFirst Amendment, applicable to the States through the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, prohibits the enactment of laws \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  U.\xc2\xa0S.

This commonsense meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccontent based\xe2\x80\x9d requires a court to consider whether a regulation of speech \xe2\x80\x9con its face\xe2\x80\x9d draws distinctions based on the message a speaker conveys.  <i>Sorrell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).  Some facial distinctions based on a message are obvious, defining regulated speech by particular subject matter, and others are more subtle, defining regulated speech by its function or purpose.

It defines \xe2\x80\x9cPolitical Signs\xe2\x80\x9d on the basis of whether a sign\xe2\x80\x99s message is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to influence the outcome of an election.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 24.

If a sign informs its reader of the time and place a book club will discuss John Locke\xe2\x80\x99s Two Treatises of Government, that sign will be treated differently from a sign expressing the view that one should vote for one of Locke\xe2\x80\x99s followers in an upcoming election, and both signs will be treated differently from a sign expressing an ideological view rooted in Locke\xe2\x80\x99s theory of government.  More to the point, the Church\xe2\x80\x99s signs inviting people to attend its worship services are treated differently from signs conveying other types of ideas.  On its face, the Sign Code is a content-based regulation of speech.  We thus have no need to consider the government\xe2\x80\x99s justifications or purposes for enacting the Code to determine whether it is subject to strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In reaching the contrary conclusion, the Court of Appeals offered several theories to explain why the Town\xe2\x80\x99s Sign Code should be deemed content neutral.  None is persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals first determined that the Sign Code was content neutral because the Town \xe2\x80\x9cdid not adopt its regulation of speech [based on] disagree[ment] with the message conveyed,\xe2\x80\x9d and its justifications for regulating temporary directional signs were \xe2\x80\x9cunrelated to the content of the sign.\xe2\x80\x9d  707 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1071\xe2\x80\x931072.  In its brief to this Court, the United States similarly contends that a sign regulation is content neutral\xe2\x80\x94even if it expressly draws distinctions based on the sign\xe2\x80\x99s communicative content\xe2\x80\x94if those distinctions can be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified without reference to the content of the regulated speech.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 20, 24 (quoting <i>Ward,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 791; emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But this analysis skips the crucial first step in thecontent-neutrality analysis: determining whether the law is content neutral on its face.  A law that is content based on its face is subject to strict scrutiny regardless of the government\xe2\x80\x99s benign motive, content-neutral justification, or lack of \xe2\x80\x9canimus toward the ideas contained\xe2\x80\x9d in the regulated speech.  <i>Cincinnati </i>v. <i>Discovery Network</i>, <i>Inc.,</i>\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410,\n429 (1993)\n.  We have thus made clear that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[i]llicit legislative intent is not the <i>sine qua non</i> of a violation of the\n \nFirst Amendment,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and a party opposing the government \xe2\x80\x9cneed adduce \xe2\x80\x98no evidence of an improper censorial motive.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, supra,</i> at 117.  Although \xe2\x80\x9ca content-based purpose may be sufficient in certain circumstances to show that a regulation is content based, it is not necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</i> v. <i>FCC</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622,\n642 (1994)\n.  In other words, an innocuous justification cannot transform a facially content-based law into one that is content neutral.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That is why we have repeatedly considered whether a law is content neutral on its face <i>before</i> turning to the law\xe2\x80\x99s justification or purpose.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Sorrell</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (statute was content based \xe2\x80\x9con its face,\xe2\x80\x9d and there was also evidence of an impermissible legislative motive); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Eichman</i>,\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,\n315 (1990)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the [statute] contains no ex-plicit content-based limitation on the scope of prohibited conduct, it is nevertheless clear that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s asserted <i>interest </i>is related to the suppression of free expression\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <i>Members of City Council of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Taxpayers for Vincent</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 789,\n804 (1984)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe text of the ordinance is neutral,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthere is not even a hint of bias or censorship in the City\xe2\x80\x99s enactment or enforcement of this ordinance\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Clark</i> v. <i>Community for Creative Non-Violence</i>,\n\n468 U.\xc2\xa0S. 288,\n293 (1984)\n (requiring that a facially content-neutral ban on camping must be \xe2\x80\x9cjustified without reference to the content of the regulated speech\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States </i>v. <i>O\xe2\x80\x99Brien</i>,\n\n391 U.\xc2\xa0S. 367,\n375,\n377 (1968)\n (noting that the statute \xe2\x80\x9con its face deals with conduct having no connection with speech,\xe2\x80\x9d but examining whether the \xe2\x80\x9cthe governmental interest is unrelated to the suppression of free expression\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because strict scrutiny applies either when a law is content based on its face or when the purpose and justification for the law are content based, a court must evaluate each question before it concludes that the law is content neutral and thus subject to a lower level of scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals and the United States misunderstand our decision in <i>Ward</i> as suggesting that a government\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is relevant even when a law is content based on its face.  That is incorrect.  <i>Ward </i>had nothing to say about facially content-based restrictions because it involved a facially content-<i>neutral</i> ban on the use, in a city-owned music venue, of sound amplification systems not provided by the city.  491 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 787, and n.\xc2\xa02.  In that context, we looked to governmental motive, including whether the government had regulated speech \xe2\x80\x9cbecause of disagreement\xe2\x80\x9d with its message, and whether the regulation was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98justified without reference to the content of the speech.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 791.  But <i>Ward</i>\xe2\x80\x99s framework \xe2\x80\x9capplies only if a statute is content neutral.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hill</i>, 530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 766 (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Its rules thus operate \xe2\x80\x9cto protect speech,\xe2\x80\x9d not \xe2\x80\x9cto restrict it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 765.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The\n \nFirst Amendment requires no less.  Innocent motives do not eliminate the danger of censorship presented by a facially content-based statute, as future government officials may one day wield such statutes to suppress disfavored speech.  That is why the\n \nFirst Amendment expressly targets the operation of the laws\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>the \xe2\x80\x9cabridg[ement] of speech\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94rather than merely the motives of those who enacted them.  U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Amdt. 1.  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The vice of content-based legislation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is not that it is always used for invidious, thought-control purposes, but that it lends itself to use for those purposes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Hill, supra,</i> at 743 (Scalia,\xc2\xa0J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For instance, in <i>NAACP </i>v. <i>Button</i>,\n\n371 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415 (1963)\n, the Court encountered a State\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to use a statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98improper solicitation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d by attorneys to outlaw litigation-related speech of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.  <i>Id.,</i> at 438.  Although <i>Button </i>predated our more recent formulations of strict scrutiny, the Court rightly rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s claim that its interest in the \xe2\x80\x9cregulation of professional conduct\xe2\x80\x9d rendered the statute consistent with the\n \nFirst Amendment, observing that \xe2\x80\x9cit is no answer .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to say .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that the purpose of these regulations was merely to insure high professional standards and not to curtail free expression.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 438\xe2\x80\x93439.  Likewise, one could easily imagine a Sign Code compliance manager who disliked the Church\xe2\x80\x99s substantive teachings deploying the Sign Code to make it more difficult for the Church to inform the public of the location of its services.  Accordingly, we have repeatedly \xe2\x80\x9crejected the argument that \xe2\x80\x98discriminatory .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. treatment is suspect under the\n \nFirst Amendment only when the legislature intends to suppress certain ideas.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Discovery Network, </i>507 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 429.  We do so again today.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals next reasoned that the Sign Code was content neutral because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not mention any idea or viewpoint, let alone single one out for differential treatment.\xe2\x80\x9d  587 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 977.  It reasoned that, for the purpose of the Code provisions, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t makes no difference which candidate is supported, who sponsors the event, or what ideological perspective is asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  707 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1069.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Town seizes on this reasoning, insisting that \xe2\x80\x9ccontent based\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art that \xe2\x80\x9cshould be applied flexibly\xe2\x80\x9d with the goal of protecting \xe2\x80\x9cviewpoints and ideas from government censorship or favoritism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 22.  In the Town\xe2\x80\x99s view, a sign regulation that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not censor or favor particular viewpoints or ideas\xe2\x80\x9d cannot be content based.  <i>Ibid</i>.  The Sign Code allegedly passes this test because its treatment of temporary directional signs does not raise any concerns that the government is \xe2\x80\x9cendorsing or suppressing \xe2\x80\x98ideas or viewpoints,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 27, and the provisions for political signs and ideological signs \xe2\x80\x9care neutral as to particular ideas or viewpoints\xe2\x80\x9d within those categories.  <i>Id.</i>, at 37.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This analysis conflates two distinct but related limitations that the\n \nFirst Amendment places on government regulation of speech.  Government discrimination among viewpoints\xe2\x80\x94or the regulation of speech based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe specific motivating ideology or the opinion or perspective of the speaker\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a \xe2\x80\x9cmore blatant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cegregious form of content discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819,\n829 (1995)\n.  But it is well established that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s hostility to content-based regulation extends not only to restrictions on particular viewpoints, but also to prohibition of public discussion of an entire topic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530,\n537 (1980)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, a speech regulation targeted at specific subject matter is content based even if it does not discriminate among viewpoints within that subject matter.  <i>Ibid.</i>  For example, a law banning the use of sound trucks for political speech\xe2\x80\x94and only political speech\xe2\x80\x94would be a content-based regulation, even if it imposed no limits on the political viewpoints that could be expressed.  See <i>Discovery Network, supra,</i> at 428.  The Town\xe2\x80\x99s Sign Code likewise singles out specific subject matter for differential treatment, even if it does not target viewpoints within that subject matter.  Ideological messages are given more favorable treatment than messages concerning a political candidate, which are themselves given more favorable treatment than messages announcing an assembly of like-minded individuals.  That is a paradigmatic example of content-based discrimination.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the Court of Appeals characterized the Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions as turning on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the content-neutral elements of who is speaking through the sign and whether and when an event is occurring.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  707 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1069.  That analysis is mistaken on both factual and legal grounds.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To start, the Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions are not speaker based.  The restrictions for political, ideological, and temporary event signs apply equally no matter who sponsors them.  If a local business, for example, sought to put up signs advertising the Church\xe2\x80\x99s meetings, those signs would be subject to the same limitations as such signs placed by the Church.  And if Reed had decided to dis-play signs in support of a particular candidate, he could have made those signs far larger\xe2\x80\x94and kept them up for far longer\xe2\x80\x94than signs inviting people to attend hischurch services.  If the Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions were truly speaker based, both types of signs would receive the same treatment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any case, the fact that a distinction is speaker based does not, as the Court of Appeals seemed to believe, automatically render the distinction content neutral.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[s]peech restrictions based on the identity of the speaker are all too often simply a means to control content,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Citizens United </i>v. <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,\n340 (2010)\n, we have insisted that \xe2\x80\x9claws favoring some speakers over others demand strict scrutiny when the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s speaker preference reflects a content preference,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Turner, </i>512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658.  Thus, a law limiting the content of newspapers, but only newspapers, could not evade strict scrutiny simply because it could be characterized as speaker based.  Likewise, a content-based law that restricted the political speech of all corporations would not become content neutral just because it singled out corporations as a class of speakers.  See<i> Citizens United, supra</i>, at 340\xe2\x80\x93341.  Characterizing a distinction as speaker based is only the beginning\xe2\x80\x94not the end\xe2\x80\x94of the inquiry.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do the Sign Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions hinge on \xe2\x80\x9cwhether and when an event is occurring.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Code does not permit citizens to post signs on any topic whatsoever within a set period leading up to an election, for example.  Instead, come election time, it requires Town officials to determine whether a sign is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to influence the outcome of an election\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical\xe2\x80\x9d) or merely \xe2\x80\x9ccommunicating a message or ideas for noncommercial purposes\xe2\x80\x9d (and thus \xe2\x80\x9cideological\xe2\x80\x9d).  Glossary 24.  That obvious content-based inquiry does not evade strict scrutiny review simply because an event (<i>i.e., </i>an election) is involved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And, just as with speaker-based laws, the fact that a distinction is event based does not render it content neutral.  The Court of Appeals cited no precedent from this Court supporting its novel theory of an exception from the content-neutrality requirement for event-based laws.  As we have explained, a speech regulation is content based if the law applies to particular speech because of the topic discussed or the idea or message expressed.  <i>Supra,</i> at 6.  A regulation that targets a sign because it conveys an idea about a specific event is no less content based than a regulation that targets a sign because it conveys some other idea.  Here, the Code singles out signs bearing a particular message: the time and location of a specific event.  This type of ordinance may seem like a perfectly rational way to regulate signs, but a clear and firm rule governing content neutrality is an essential means of protecting the freedom of speech, even if laws that might seem \xe2\x80\x9centirely reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d will sometimes be \xe2\x80\x9cstruck down because of their content-based nature.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>City of Ladue</i> v. <i>Gilleo</i>,\n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 43,\n60 (1994)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because the Town\xe2\x80\x99s Sign Code imposes content-based restrictions on speech, those provisions can stand only if they survive strict scrutiny, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98which requires the Government to prove that the restriction furthers a compelling interest and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Arizona Free Enterprise Club\xe2\x80\x99s Freedom Club PAC </i>v. <i>Bennett</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 8) (quoting <i>Citizens United</i>, 558 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 340).  Thus, it is the Town\xe2\x80\x99s burden to demonstrate that the Code\xe2\x80\x99s differentiation between temporary directional signs and other types of signs, such as political signs and ideological signs, furthers a compelling governmental interest and is narrowly tailored to that end.  See<i> ibid</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Town cannot do so.  It has offered only two governmental interests in support of the distinctions the Sign Code draws: preserving the Town\xe2\x80\x99s aesthetic appeal and traffic safety.  Assuming for the sake of argument that those are compelling governmental interests, the Code\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions fail as hopelessly underinclusive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Starting with the preservation of aesthetics, temporary directional signs are \xe2\x80\x9cno greater an eyesore,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Discovery Network</i>, 507 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 425, than ideological or political ones.  Yet the Code allows unlimited proliferation of larger ideological signs while strictly limiting the number, size, and duration of smaller directional ones.  The Town cannot claim that placing strict limits on temporary directional signs is necessary to beautify the Town while at the same time allowing unlimited numbers of other types of signs that create the same problem.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Town similarly has not shown that limiting temporary directional signs is necessary to eliminate threats to traffic safety, but that limiting other types of signs is not.  The Town has offered no reason to believe that directional signs pose a greater threat to safety than do ideological or political signs.  If anything, a sharply worded ideological sign seems more likely to distract a driver than a sign directing the public to a nearby church meeting.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In light of this underinclusiveness, the Town has not met its burden to prove that its Sign Code is narrowly tailored to further a compelling government interest.  Because a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98law cannot be regarded as protecting an interest of the highest order, and thus as justifying a restriction on truthful speech, when it leaves appreciable damage to that supposedly vital interest unprohibited,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Republican Party of Minn. </i>v. <i>White</i>,\n\n536 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n780 (2002)\n, the Sign Code fails strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Our decision today will not prevent governments from enacting effective sign laws.  The Town asserts that an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98absolutist\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d content-neutrality rule would render \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually all distinctions in sign laws .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. subject to strict scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondents 34\xe2\x80\x9335, but that is not the case.  Not \xe2\x80\x9call distinctions\xe2\x80\x9d are subject to strict scrutiny, only <i>content-based</i> ones are.  Laws that are <i>content neutral</i> are instead subject to lesser scrutiny.  See <i>Clark</i>, 468 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 295.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Town has ample content-neutral options available to resolve problems with safety and aesthetics.  For example, its current Code regulates many aspects of signs that have nothing to do with a sign\xe2\x80\x99s message: size, building materials, lighting, moving parts, and portability.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> \xc2\xa74.402(R).  And on public property, the Town may go a long way toward entirely forbidding the posting of signs, so long as it does so in an evenhanded, content-neutral manner.  See <i>Taxpayers for Vincent</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 817 (upholding content-neutral ban against posting signs on public property).  Indeed, some lower courts have long held that similar content-based sign laws receive strict scrutiny, but there is no evidence that towns in those jurisdictions have suffered catastrophic effects.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Solantic, LLC </i>v. <i>Neptune Beach</i>, 410 F.\xc2\xa03d 1250, 1264\xe2\x80\x931269 (CA11 2005) (sign categories similar to the town of Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s were content based and subject to strict scru-tiny); <i>Matthews </i>v. <i>Needham</i>, 764 F.\xc2\xa02d 58, 59\xe2\x80\x9360 (CA1 1985) (law banning political signs but not commercial signs was content based and subject to strict scrutiny).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We acknowledge that a city might reasonably view the general regulation of signs as necessary because signs \xe2\x80\x9ctake up space and may obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>City of Ladue</i>,<i> </i>512 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 48.  At the same time, the presence of certain signs may be essential, both for vehicles and pedestrians, to guide traffic or to identify hazards and ensure safety.

For example, some municipalities generally prohibit illuminated signs in residential neighborhoods, but lift that ban for signs that identify the address of a home or the name of its owner or occupant.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, City of Truth or Consequences, N.\xc2\xa0M., Code of Ordinances, ch. 16, Art. XIII, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa711\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x932.3, 11\xe2\x80\x9313\xe2\x80\x932.9(H)(4) (2014).  In other municipalities, safety signs such as \xe2\x80\x9cBlind Pedestrian Crossing\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cHidden Driveway\xe2\x80\x9d can be posted without a permit, even as other permanent signs require one.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Code of Athens-Clarke County, Ga., Pt. III, \xc2\xa77\xe2\x80\x934\xe2\x80\x937(1) (1993).  Elsewhere, historic site markers\xe2\x80\x94for example,<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cGeorge Washington Slept Here\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94are also exempt from general regulations.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, Dover, Del., Code of Ordinances, Pt. II, App. B, Art. 5, \xc2\xa74.5(F) (2012).  And simi-larly, the federal Highway Beautification Act limits signs along interstate highways unless, for instance, they direct travelers to \xe2\x80\x9cscenic and historical attractions\xe2\x80\x9d or advertise free coffee.  See 23 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7131(b), (c)(1), (c)(5).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, many sign ordinances of that kind are now in jeopardy.  See <i>ante</i>, at 14 (acknowledging that \xe2\x80\x9centirely reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d sign laws \xe2\x80\x9cwill sometimes be struck down\xe2\x80\x9d under its approach (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Says the majority: When laws \xe2\x80\x9csingle[\xc2\xa0] out specific subject matter,\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9cfacially content based\xe2\x80\x9d; and when they are facially content based, they are automatically subject to strict scrutiny.  <i>Ante</i>, at 12, 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  And although the majority holds out hope that some sign laws with subject-matter exemptions \xe2\x80\x9cmight survive\xe2\x80\x9d that stringent review, <i>ante</i>, at 17, the likelihood is that most will be struck down.  After all, it is the \xe2\x80\x9crare case[\xc2\xa0] in which a speech restriction withstands strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams-Yulee</i> v. <i>Florida Bar</i>, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 9).  To clear that high bar, the government must show that a content-based distinction \xe2\x80\x9cis necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arkansas Writers\xe2\x80\x99 Project, Inc.</i> v. <i>Ragland</i>,\n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 221,\n231 (1987)\n.<b> </b>So on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, courts would have to determine that a town has a compelling interest in informing passersby where George Washington slept.  And likewise, courts would have to find that a town has no other way to prevent hidden-driveway mishaps than by specially treating hidden-driveway signs.  (Well-placed speed bumps?  Lower speed limits?  Or how about just a ban on hidden driveways?)  The consequence\xe2\x80\x94unless courts water down strict scrutiny to something unrecognizable\xe2\x80\x94is that our communities will find themselves in an unenviable bind: They will have to either repeal the exemptions that allow for helpful signs on streets and sidewalks, or else lift their sign restrictions altogether and resign themselves to the resulting clutter.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although the majority insists that applying strict scrutiny to all such ordinances is \xe2\x80\x9cessential\xe2\x80\x9d to protecting\n \nFirst Amendment freedoms, <i>ante</i>, at 14, I find it challenging to understand why that is so.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions articulate two important and related reasons for subjecting content-based speech regulations to the most exacting standard of review.  The first is \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve an uninhib-ited marketplace of ideas in which truth will ultimately prevail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McCullen</i> v. <i>Coakley</i>, 573 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The second is to ensure that the government has not regulated speech \xe2\x80\x9cbased on hostility\xe2\x80\x94or favoritism\xe2\x80\x94towards the underlying message expressed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>R. A. V. </i>v. <i>St. Paul</i>,\n\n505 U. S. 377,\n386 (1992)\n.  Yet the subject-matter exemptions included in many sign ordinances do not implicate those concerns.  Allowing residents, say, to install a light bulb over \xe2\x80\x9cname and address\xe2\x80\x9d signs but no others does not distort the marketplace of ideas.  Nor does that different treatment give rise to an inference of impermissible government motive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We apply strict scrutiny to facially content-based regulations of speech, in keeping with the rationales just described, when there is any \xe2\x80\x9crealistic possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Davenport</i> v. <i>Washington Ed. Assn.</i>,\n\n551 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177,\n189 (2007)\n (quoting <i>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 390).  That is always the case when the regulation facially differentiates on the basis of viewpoint.  See <i>Rosenberger</i> v. <i>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819,\n829 (1995)\n.  It is also the case (except in non-public or limited public forums) when a law restricts \xe2\x80\x9cdiscussion of an entire topic\xe2\x80\x9d in public debate.  <i>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i> v. <i>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 530\n\xe2\x80\x93540 (1980) (invalidating a limitation on speech about nuclear power).  We have stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the marketplace of ideas is to remain free and open, governments must not be allowed to choose \xe2\x80\x98which issues are worth discussing or debating.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 537\xe2\x80\x93538 (quoting <i>Police Dept. of Chicago </i>v.<i> Mosley</i>,\n\n408 U. S. 92,\n96 (1972)\n).  And we have recognized that such subject-matter restrictions, even though viewpoint-neutral on their face, may \xe2\x80\x9csuggest[\xc2\xa0] an attempt to give one side of a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>First Nat. Bank of Boston</i> v. <i>Bellotti</i>,\n\n435 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n785 (1978)\n; accord, <i>ante</i>, at 1 (Alito, J., concurring) (limiting all speech on one topic \xe2\x80\x9cfavors those who do not want to disturb the status quo\xe2\x80\x9d).  Subject-matter regulation, in other words, may have the intent or effect of favoring some ideas over others.  When that is realistically possible\xe2\x80\x94when the restriction \xe2\x80\x9craises the specter that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94we insist that the law pass the most demanding constitutional test.  <i>R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V.</i>,<i> </i>505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 387 (quoting <i>Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.</i> v. <i>Members of N. Y. State Crime Victims Bd.</i>,\n\n502 U.\xc2\xa0S. 105,\n116 (1991)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But when that is not realistically possible, we may do well to relax our guard so that \xe2\x80\x9centirely reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d laws imperiled by strict scrutiny can survive.  <i>Ante</i>, at 14.  This point is by no means new.  Our concern with content-based regulation arises from the fear that the government will skew the public\xe2\x80\x99s debate of ideas\xe2\x80\x94so when \xe2\x80\x9cthat risk is inconsequential, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. strict scrutiny is unwarranted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Davenport</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188; see <i>R.\xc2\xa0A. V.</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 388 (approving certain content-based distinctions when there is \xe2\x80\x9cno significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d).  To do its intended work, of course, the category of content-based regulation triggering strict scrutiny must sweep more broadly than the actual harm; that category exists to create a buffer zone guaranteeing that the government cannot favor or disfavor certain viewpoints.  But that buffer zone need not extend forever.  We can administer our content-regulation doctrine with a dose of common sense, so as to leave standing laws that in no way implicate its intended function.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">And indeed we have done just that: Our cases have been far less rigid than the majority admits in applying strict scrutiny to facially content-based laws\xe2\x80\x94including in cases just like this one.  See <i>Davenport</i>, 551 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188 (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cwe have identified numerous situations in which [the] risk\xe2\x80\x9d attached to content-based laws is \xe2\x80\x9cattenuated\xe2\x80\x9d).  In <i>Members of City Council of Los Angeles</i> v. <i>Taxpayers for Vincent</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 789 (1984)\n, the Court declined to apply strict scrutiny to a municipal ordinance that exempted address numbers and markers commemorating \xe2\x80\x9chistorical, cultural, or artistic event[s]\xe2\x80\x9d from a generally applicable limit on sidewalk signs.  <i>Id.</i>, at 792, n.\xc2\xa01 (listing exemptions); see <i>id.</i>, at 804\xe2\x80\x93810 (upholding ordinance under intermediate scrutiny).  After all, we explained, the law\xe2\x80\x99s enactment and enforcement revealed \xe2\x80\x9cnot even a hint of bias or censorship.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 804; see also <i>Renton</i> v. <i>Playtime Theatres, Inc.</i>,\n\n475 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41,\n48 (1986)\n (applying intermediate scrutiny to a zoning law that facially distinguished among movie theaters based on content because it was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to prevent crime, protect the city\xe2\x80\x99s retail trade, [and] maintain property values .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , not to suppress the expression of unpopular views\xe2\x80\x9d).  And another decision involving a similar law provides an alternative model.  In <i>City of Ladue</i> v. <i>Gilleo</i>,\n\n512 U. S. 43 (1994)\n, the Court assumed <i>arguendo</i> that a sign ordinance\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions for address signs, safety signs, and for-sale signs in residential areas did not trigger strict scrutiny.  See <i>id.</i>, at 46\xe2\x80\x9347, and n.\xc2\xa06 (listing exemptions); <i>id.</i>, at 53 (noting this assumption).  We did not need to, and so did not, decide the level-of-scrutiny question because the law\xe2\x80\x99s breadth made it unconstitutional under any standard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority could easily have taken <i>Ladue</i>\xe2\x80\x99s tack here.  The Town of Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s defense of its sign ordinance\xe2\x80\x94most notably, the law\xe2\x80\x99s distinctions between directional signs and others\xe2\x80\x94does not pass strict scrutiny, or intermediate scrutiny, or even the laugh test.  See <i>ante</i>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315<i> </i>(discussing those distinctions).  The Town, for example, provides no reason at all for prohibiting more than four directional signs on a property while placing no limits on the number of other types of signs.  See Gilbert, Ariz., Land Development Code, ch. I, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74.402(J), (P)(2) (2014).  Similarly, the Town offers no coherent justification for restricting the size of directional signs to 6 square feet while allowing other signs to reach 20 square feet.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74.402(J), (P)(1).  The best the Town could come up with at oral argument was that directional signs \xe2\x80\x9cneed to be smaller because they need to guide travelers along a route.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 40.  Why exactly a smaller sign better helps travelers get to where they are going is left a mystery.  The absence of any sensible basis for these and other distinctions dooms the Town\xe2\x80\x99s ordinance under even the intermediate scrutiny that the Court typically applies to \xe2\x80\x9ctime, place, or manner\xe2\x80\x9d speech regulations.  Accordingly, there is no need to decide in this case whether strict scrutiny applies to every sign ordinance in every town across this country containing a subject-matter exemption.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I suspect this Court and others will regret the majority\xe2\x80\x99s insistence today on answering that question in the affirmative.  As the years go by, courts will discover that thousands of towns have such ordinances, many of them \xe2\x80\x9centirely reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>,<i> </i>at 14.  And as the challenges to them mount, courts will have to invalidate one after the other.  (This Court may soon find itself a veritable Supreme Board of Sign Review.)  And courts will strike down those democratically enacted local laws even though no one\xe2\x80\x94certainly not the majority\xe2\x80\x94has ever explained why the vindication of\n \nFirst Amendment values requires that result.  Because I see no reason why such an easy case calls for us to cast a constitutional pall on reasonable regulations quite unlike the law before us, I concur only in the judgment.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0Even in trying (commendably) to limit today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence highlights its far-reaching effects.

In my view, the category \xe2\x80\x9ccontent discrimination\xe2\x80\x9d is better considered in many contexts, including here, as a rule of thumb, rather than as an automatic \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d trigger, leading to almost certain legal condemnation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To use content discrimination to trigger strict scrutiny sometimes makes perfect sense.  There are cases in which the Court has found content discrimination an unconstitutional method for suppressing a viewpoint.  <i>E.g., Rosenberger </i>v. <i>Rector and</i> <i>Visitors of Univ. of Va.</i>,\n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 819\n\xe2\x80\x93829 (1995); see also <i>Boos </i>v. <i>Barry</i>,\n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 312\n\xe2\x80\x93319 (1988) (plurality opinion) (applying strict scrutiny where the line between subject matter and viewpoint was not obvious).  And there are cases where the Court has found content discrimination to reveal that rules governing a traditional public forum are, in fact, not a neutral way of fairly managing the forum in the interest of all speakers.  <i>Police Dept. of Chicago </i>v. <i>Mosley</i>,\n\n408 U.\xc2\xa0S. 92,\n96 (1972)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cOnce a forum is opened up to assembly or speaking by some groups, government may not prohibit others from assembling or speaking on the basis of what they intend to say\xe2\x80\x9d).  In these types of cases, strict scru-tiny is often appropriate, and content discrimination has thus served a useful purpose.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">But content discrimination, while helping courts to identify unconstitutional suppression of expression, cannot and should not <i>always</i> trigger strict scrutiny.  To say that it is not an automatic \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d trigger is not to argue against that concept\xe2\x80\x99s use.  I readily concede, for example, that content discrimination, as a conceptual tool, can sometimes reveal weaknesses in the government\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for a rule that limits speech.  If, for example, a city looks to litter prevention as the rationale for a prohibition against placing newsracks dispensing free advertisements on public property, why does it exempt other newsracks causing similar litter?  Cf. <i>Cincinnati </i>v. <i>Discovery Network, Inc.</i>,\n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 410 (1993)\n.  I also concede that, whenever government disfavors one kind of speech, it places that speech at a disadvantage, potentially interfering with the free marketplace of ideas and with an individual\xe2\x80\x99s ability to express thoughts and ideas that can help that individual determine the kind of society in which he wishes to live, help shape that society, and help define his place within it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nonetheless, in these latter instances to use the presence of content discrimination automatically to trigger strict scrutiny and thereby call into play a strong presumption against constitutionality goes too far.  That is because virtually all government activities involve speech, many of which involve the regulation of speech.  Regula-tory programs almost always require content discrimination.  And to hold that such content discrimination triggers strict scrutiny is to write a recipe for judicial management of ordinary government regulatory activity.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consider a few examples of speech regulated by government that inevitably involve content discrimination, but where a strong presumption against constitutionality has no place. Consider governmental regulation of securities, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778<i>l</i> (requirements for content that must be included in a registration statement); of energy conservation labeling-practices, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76294 (requirements for content that must be included on labels of certain consumer electronics); of prescription drugs, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7353(b)(4)(A) (requiring a prescription drug label to bear the symbol \xe2\x80\x9cRx only\xe2\x80\x9d); of doctor-patient confidentiality, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n38 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77332 (requiring confidentiality of certain medical records, but allowing a physician to disclose that the patient has HIV to the patient\xe2\x80\x99s spouse or sexual partner);<i> </i>of income tax statements, <i>e.g., </i>\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76039F (requiring taxpayers to furnish information about foreign gifts received if the aggregate amount exceeds $10,000); of commercial airplane briefings, <i>e.g., </i>14 CFR \xc2\xa7136.7 (2015) (requiring pilots to ensure that each passenger has been briefed on flight procedures, such as seatbelt fastening); of signs at petting zoos, <i>e.g.,</i> N.\xc2\xa0Y. Gen. Bus. Law Ann. \xc2\xa7399\xe2\x80\x93ff(3) (West Cum. Supp. 2015) (requiring petting zoos to post a sign at every exit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strongly recommend[ing] that persons wash their hands upon exiting the petting zoo area\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); and so on.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor can the majority avoid the application of strict scrutiny to all sorts of justifiable governmental regulations by relying on this Court\xe2\x80\x99s many subcategories and exceptions to the rule.  The Court has said, for example, that we should apply less strict standards to \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial speech.\xe2\x80\x9d<i> Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp.</i> v. <i>Public Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0 Y.</i>,\n\n447 U.\xc2\xa0S. 557\n\xe2\x80\x93563 (1980).  ButI have great concern that many justifiable instancesof \xe2\x80\x9ccontent-based\xe2\x80\x9d regulation are noncommercial.  And, worse than that, the Court has applied the heightened \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d standard even in cases where the less stringent \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial speech\xe2\x80\x9d standard was appropriate. See <i>Sorrell </i>v. <i>IMS Health Inc.</i>, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (slip op., at ___ )<i>.  </i>The Court has also said that \xe2\x80\x9cgovernment speech\xe2\x80\x9d escapes\n \nFirst Amendment strictures.  See <i>Rust </i>v. <i>Sullivan</i>,\n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 173\n\xe2\x80\x93194 (1991).  But regulated speech is typically private speech, not government speech.  Further, the Court has said that, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable, no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  R.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0V. </i>v.<i> St.\xc2\xa0Paul</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377,\n388 (1992)\n.<i> </i> But this exception accounts for only a few of the instances in which content discrimination is readily justifiable.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I recognize that the Court could escape the problem by watering down the force of the presumption against constitutionality that \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d normally carries with it.  But, in my view, doing so will weaken the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection in instances where \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scru-tiny\xe2\x80\x9d should apply in full force.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>The better approach is to generally treat content discrimination as a strong reason weighing against the constitutionality of a rule where a traditional public forum, or where viewpoint discrimination, is threatened, but elsewhere treat it as a rule of thumb, finding it a helpful, but not determinative legal tool, in an appropriate case, to determine the strength of a justification.  I would use content discrimination as a supplement to a more basic analysis, which, tracking most of our\n \nFirst Amendment cases, asks whether the regulation at issue works harm to\n \nFirst Amendment interests that is disproportionate in light of the relevant regulatory objectives.  Answering this question requires examining the seriousness of the harm to speech, the importance of the countervailing objectives, the extent to which the law will achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive ways of doing so. See, <i>e.g., United States </i>v. <i>Alvarez</i>, 567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2012) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x933); <i>Nixon </i>v. <i>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n\xe2\x80\x93403 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring).  Admittedly, this approach does not have the simplicity of a mechanical use of categories.  But it does permit the government to regulate speech in numerous instances where the voters have authorized the government to regulate and where courts should hesitate to substitute judicial judgment for that of administrators.</i></p><i>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, regulation of signage along the roadside, for purposes of safety and beautification is at issue.  There is no traditional public forum nor do I find any general effort to censor a particular viewpoint.  Consequently, the specific regulation at issue does not warrant \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nonetheless, for the reasons that Justice Kagan sets forth, I believe that the Town of Gilbert\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory rules violate the\n \nFirst Amendment.  I consequently concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment only. </p>\n</i></div><i>\n</i></div><i>\n</i>\n</div>'
