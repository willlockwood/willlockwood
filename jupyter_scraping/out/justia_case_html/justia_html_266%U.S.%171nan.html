JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Proceeding in admiralty appellant sought to recover damages for personal injuries received while he was employed by respondent and engaged in repairing the steamer <em>Starmount.</em>  Upon motion, the trial court dismissed the libel, holding that it had no jurisdiction of the cause.</p>\n<p>The libel alleges that respondent had charge of the work of repairing the shell plates of the steamer, then resting in a floating dock at Twenty-Seventh Street, Brooklyn; that, while employed by respondent and working on board, appellant suffered injuries through the explosion of a blau torch which the employer negligently permitted to be out of repair.  The prayer was for monition according to the course and practice in admiralty and for damages.</p>\n<p>Since the decree below (June 14, 1921), we have decided <em>Great Lakes Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v. Kierejewski,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/261/479/case.html">261 U. S. 479</a></span>.  The opinion there controls this cause unless the injuries sustained by appellant were not the result of tort committed and effective on navigable waters.  In <em>The R. W. Parsons,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/191/17/case.html">191 U. S. 17</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/191/17/case.html#33">191 U. S. 33</a></span>, this Court held that repairs to a vessel while in an ordinary dry dock were not made on land.  <em>The Jefferson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/215/130/case.html">215 U. S. 130</a></span>.  Here, repairs were made upon the ship while supported by a structure floating on navigable waters.  Clearly the accident did not occur upon land.  The doctrine followed in <em>Cope v. Vallette Dry Dock Company,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/625/case.html">119 U. S. 625</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/119/625/case.html#627">119 U. S. 627</a></span>, that "no structure that is not a ship or vessel is a subject of salvage" has no application.  That admiralty jurisdiction in tort matters depends upon locality is settled.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment below must be reversed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
