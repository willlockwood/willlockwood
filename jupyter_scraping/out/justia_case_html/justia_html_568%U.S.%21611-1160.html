The Authority formed two private nonprofit corporations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc. (PPHS) and Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital, Inc. (PPMH).  After the Authority decided to purchase the second hospital in the county and lease it to a subsidiary of PPHS, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued an administrative complaint alleging that the transaction would substantially reduce competition in the market for acute-care hospital services, in violation of \xc2\xa75 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and \xc2\xa77 of the Clayton Act.  The FTC and Georgia subsequently sued the Authority, PPHS, PPMH, and others (collectively respondents), seeking to enjoin the transaction pending administrative proceedings.  The District Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction and granted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss, holding that respondents are immune from antitrust liability under the state-action doctrine.  The Eleventh Circuit affirmed.  It concluded that the Authority, as a local governmental entity, was entitled to state-action immunity because the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a foreseeable result of the Law.  The court reasoned that the state legislature could have readily anticipated an anticompetitive effect, given the breadth of the powers delegated to hospital authorities, particularly leasing and acquisition powers that could lead to consolidation of hospital ownership.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Because Georgia has not clearly articulated and affirmatively expressed a policy allowing hospital authorities to make acquisitions that substantially lessen competition, state-action immunity does not apply.

Brown, \n\n317 U.\xc2\xa0S. 341\n\xe2\x80\x93352, that the federal antitrust laws do not prevent States from imposing market restraints \xe2\x80\x9cas an act of government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. .\xe2\x80\x9d  Under the state-action doctrine, immunity from federal antitrust law may extend to nonstate actors carrying out the State\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory program.  See, e.g., Patrick v. Burget, \n\n486 U.\xc2\xa0S. 94\n\xe2\x80\x93100.  But given the antitrust laws\xe2\x80\x99 values of free enterprise and economic competition, \xe2\x80\x9cstate-action immunity is disfavored,\xe2\x80\x9d FTC v. Ticor Title Ins. Co., \n\n504 U.\xc2\xa0S. 621\n, and is recognized only when it is clear that the challenged anticompetitive conduct is undertaken pursuant to the \xe2\x80\x9cState\xe2\x80\x99s own\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory scheme, id., at 635.  Immunity will attach only to activities of substate governmental entities that are undertaken pursuant to a \xe2\x80\x9cclearly articulated and affirmatively expressed\xe2\x80\x9d state policy to displace competition.  Community Communications Co. v. Boulder, \n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 40\n.  A state legislature need not \xe2\x80\x9cexpressly state\xe2\x80\x9d that intent, Hallie v. Eau Claire, \n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 34\n, but the anticompetitive effect must have been the \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeable result\xe2\x80\x9d of what the State authorized, id., at 42.

The Authority\xe2\x80\x99s powers, including its acquisition and leasing powers, mirror general powers routinely conferred by state law on private corporations.  More is required to establish state-action immunity; the Authority must show that it has been delegated authority not just to act, but to act or regulate anticompetitively.  Columbia v. Omni Outdoor Advertising, Inc., \n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 365\n.  In Boulder, this Court concluded that a Colorado law granting municipalities the power to enact ordinances governing local affairs did not satisfy the clear-articulation test, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356, because, when a State\xe2\x80\x99s position \xe2\x80\x9cis one of mere neutrality respecting the municipal actions challenged as anticompetitive,\xe2\x80\x9d the State cannot be said to have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98contemplated\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d those anticompetitive actions, id., at 55.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat principle controls here.  Grants of general corporate power allowing substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive marketplace are typically used without raising federal antitrust concerns, so a State cannot be said to have contemplated that such powers will be used anticompetitively.  Here, though the Law allows the Authority to acquire hospitals, it does not clearly articulate and affirmatively express a state policy empowering the Authority to make acquisitions of existing hospitals that will substantially lessen competition.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0In concluding otherwise, the Eleventh Circuit applied the concept of \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeability\xe2\x80\x9d too loosely.  This Court, recognizing that no legislature \xe2\x80\x9ccan be expected to catalog all of the anticipated effects\xe2\x80\x9d of a statute delegating authority to a substate governmental entity, Hallie, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 43, has approached the clear-articulation inquiry practically, but without diluting the ultimate requirement that the State must have affirmatively contemplated the displacement of competition such that the challenged anticompetitive effects can be attributed to the \xe2\x80\x9cstate itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Parker, 317 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 352.  Thus, the Court has found a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.  In that scenario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.  See Hallie, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 41; Omni, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373.  By contrast, when a State grants an entity a general power to act, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.  Entities might transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their powers anticompetitively, but a reasonable legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ability to anticipate that possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition.  The Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s argument, echoed by respondents, that the case falls within the foreseeability standard used in Hallie and Omni is rejected.  Pp.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x9314.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 additional arguments are also unpersuasive.  They contend that because hospital authorities are granted unique powers and responsibilities to fulfill Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s objective of providing access to adequate and affordable health care, it was foreseeable that they would decide that the best way to serve their communities was to acquire an existing local hospital, instead of incurring the additional expense and regulatory burden of expanding, or constructing, a facility.  But even though the authorities may differ from private corporations offering hospital services, neither the Law nor any other state-law provision clearly articulates a state policy allowing authorities to exercise their general corporate powers without regard to anticompetitive effects.  Respondents also contend that when there is doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied, federal courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state policy choices.  But the Law here is not ambiguous, and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion is inconsistent with the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cstate-action immunity is disfavored,\xe2\x80\x9d Ticor Title, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.

In 1990, the Authority restructured its operations by forming two private nonprofit corporations to manage Memorial: Phoebe Putney Health System, Inc.

At the time suit was brought in this case, Palmyra was operated by a national for-profit hospital network, HCA, Inc. (HCA).  Together, Memorial and Palmyra account for 86 percent of the market for acute-care hospital services provided to commercial health care plans and their customers in the six counties surrounding Al- bany.

As an initial matter, the court \xe2\x80\x9cagree[d] with the [FTC] that, on the facts alleged, the joint operation of Memorial and Palmyra would substantially lessen competition or tend to create, if not create, a monopoly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1375.  But the court con-cluded that the transaction was immune from antitrust liability.  See id., at 1375\xe2\x80\x931378.  The Court of Appeals explained that as a local governmental entity, the Authority was entitled to state-action immunity if the challenged anticompetitive conduct was a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98foreseeable result\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s legislation.

Applying that standard, the Court of Appeals concluded that the Law contemplated the anticompetitive conduct challenged by the FTC.

More specifically, the court reasoned that the Georgia Legislature must have anticipated that the grant of power to hospital authorities to acquire and lease projects would produce anticompetitive effects because \xe2\x80\x9c[f]oreseeably, acquisitions could consolidate ownership of competing hospitals, eliminating competition between them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 1377.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals also rejected the FTC\xe2\x80\x99s alternative argument that state-action immunity did not apply because the transaction in substance involved a transfer of control over Palmyra from one private entity to another, with the Authority acting as a mere conduit for the sale to evade antitrust liability.

Grants of general corporate power that allow substate governmental entities to participate in a competitive marketplace should be, can be, and typically are used in ways that raise no federal antitrust concerns.

Thus, we have concluded that a state policy to displace federal antitrust law was sufficiently expressed where the displacement of competition was the inherent, logical, or ordinary result of the exercise of authority delegated by the state legislature.  In that scenario, the State must have foreseen and implicitly endorsed the anticompetitive effects as consistent with its policy goals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, in Hallie, Wisconsin statutory law regulating the municipal provision of sewage services expressly permitted cities to limit their service to surrounding unincorporated areas.

While unincorporated towns alleged that the city\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of that power constituted an unlawful tying arrangement, an unlawful refusal to deal, and an abuse of monopoly power, we had no trouble concluding that these alleged anticompetitive effects were affirmatively contemplated by the State because it was \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d that they \xe2\x80\x9clogically would result\xe2\x80\x9d from the grant of authority.  Id., at 42.  As described by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, the state legislature \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98viewed annexation by the city of a surrounding unincorporated area as a reasonable quid pro quo that a city could require before extending sewer services to the area.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Id., at 44\xe2\x80\x9345, n.\xc2\xa08 (quoting Hallie v.

Without immunity, federal antitrust law could have undermined that arrangement and taken completely off the table the policy option that the State clearly intended for cities to have.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, in Omni, where the respondents alleged that the city had used its zoning power to protect an incumbent billboard provider against competition, we found that the clear-articulation test was easily satisfied even though the state statutes delegating zoning authority to the city did not explicitly permit the suppression of competition.  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he very purpose of zoning regulation is to displace unfettered business freedom in a manner that regularly has the effect of preventing normal acts of competition\xe2\x80\x9d and that a zoning ordinance regulating the size, location, and spacing of billboards \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily protects existing billboards against some competition from newcomers.\xe2\x80\x9d  499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 373.  Other cases in which we have found a \xe2\x80\x9cclear articulation\xe2\x80\x9d of the State\xe2\x80\x99s intent to displace competition without an explicit statement have also involved authorizations to act or regulate in ways that were inherently anticompetitive.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy contrast, \xe2\x80\x9csimple permission to play in a market\xe2\x80\x9d does not \xe2\x80\x9cforeseeably entail permission to roughhouse in that market unlawfully.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kay Elec.

When a State grants some entity general power to act, whether it is a private corporation or a public entity like the Authority, it does so against the backdrop of federal antitrust law.  See Ticor Title, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 632.  Of course, both private parties and local governmental entities conceivably may transgress antitrust requirements by exercising their general powers in anticompetitive ways.  But a reasonable legislature\xe2\x80\x99s ability to anticipate that (potentially undesirable) possibility falls well short of clearly articulating an affirmative state policy to displace competition with a regulatory alternative.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBelieving that this case falls within the scope of the foreseeability standard applied in Hallie and Omni, the Court of Appeals stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t defies imagination to suppose the [state] legislature could have believed that every geographic market in Georgia was so replete with hospitals that authorizing acquisitions by the authorities could have no serious anticompetitive consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  663 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1377.  Respondents echo this argument, noting that each of Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s 159 counties covers a small geographical area and that most of them are sparsely populated, with nearly three-quarters having fewer than 50,000 residents as of the 2010 Census.

Code Ann. \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9375(4) has the potential to negatively affect competition.  Contrary to the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 characterization, \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9375(4) is not principally concerned with hospital authorities\xe2\x80\x99 ability to acquire multiple hospitals and consolidate their operations.  Section 31\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9375(4) allows authorities to acquire \xe2\x80\x9cprojects,\xe2\x80\x9d which includes not only \xe2\x80\x9chospitals,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9chealth care facilities, dormitories, office buildings, clinics, housing accommodations, nursing homes, rehabilitation centers, extended care facilities, and other public health facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9371(5).  Narrowing our focus to the market for hospital services, the power to acquire hospitals still does not ordinarily produce anticompetitive effects.  Section 31\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9375(4) was, after all, the source of power for newly formed hospital authorities to acquire a hospital in the first instance\xe2\x80\x94a transaction that was unlikely to raise any antitrust concerns even in small markets because the transfer of ownership from private to public hands does not increase market concentration.  See 1A Areeda &amp; Hovenkamp \xc2\xb6224e(c), at 126 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ubstitution of one monopolist for another is not an antitrust violation\xe2\x80\x9d).  While subsequent acquisitions by authorities have the potential to reduce competition, they will raise federal antitrust concerns only in markets that are large enough to support more than one hospital but sufficiently small that the merger of competitors would lead to a significant increase in market concentration.  This is too slender a reed to support the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 and respondents\xe2\x80\x99 inference.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTaking a somewhat different approach than the Court of Appeals, respondents insist that the Law should not be read as a mere authorization for hospital authorities to participate in the hospital-services market and exercise general corporate powers.  Rather, they contend that hos- pital authorities are granted unique powers and respon- sibilities to fulfill the State\xe2\x80\x99s objective of providing all residents with access to adequate and affordable health and hospital care.  See, e.g., Ga. Code Ann. \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x937\xe2\x80\x9375(22).  Respondents argue that in view of hospital authorities\xe2\x80\x99 statutory objective, their specific attributes, and the regulatory context in which they operate, it was foreseeable that authorities facing capacity constraints would decide they could best serve their communities\xe2\x80\x99 needs by acquiring an existing local hospital rather than incur the additional expense and regulatory burden of expanding a facility or constructing a new one.

Moreover, hospital authorities operate within a broader regulatory context in which Georgia requires any party seeking to establish or significantly expand certain medical facilities, including hospitals, to obtain a certificate of need from state regulators.  See \xc2\xa731\xe2\x80\x936\xe2\x80\x9340 et\xc2\xa0seq.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe have no doubt that Georgia\xe2\x80\x99s hospital authorities differ materially from private corporations that offer hospital services.  But nothing in the Law or any other provision of Georgia law clearly articulates a state policy to allow authorities to\xc2\xa0exercise their general corporate powers, including their acquisition power, without regard to negative effects on competition.  The state legislature\xe2\x80\x99s objective of improving access to affordable health care does not logically suggest that the State intended that hospital authorities pursue that end through mergers that create monopolies.  Nor do the restrictions imposed on hospital authorities, including the requirement that they operate on a nonprofit basis, reveal such a policy.  Particularly in light of our national policy favoring competition, these restrictions should be read to reflect more modest aims.  The legislature may have viewed profit generation as incompatible with its goal of providing care for the indigent sick.  In addition, the legislature may have believed that some hospital authorities would operate in markets with characteristics of natural monopolies, in which case the legislature could not rely on competition to control prices.  See Cantor v. Detroit Edison Co., \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 579\n\xe2\x80\x93596 (1976).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe recognize that Georgia, particularly through its certificate of need requirement, does limit competition in the market for hospital services in some respects.  But regulation of an industry, and even the authorization of discrete forms of anticompetitive conduct pursuant to a regulatory structure, does not establish that the State has affirmatively contemplated other forms of anticompetitive conduct that are only tangentially related.  Thus, in Goldfarb v. Virginia State Bar, \n\n421 U.\xc2\xa0S. 773 (1975)\n, we re- jected a state-action defense to price-fixing claims where a state bar adopted a compulsory minimum fee schedule.  Although the State heavily regulated the practice of law, we found no evidence that it had adopted a policy to displace price competition among lawyers.  Id., at 788\xe2\x80\x93792.  And in Cantor, we concluded that a state commission\xe2\x80\x99s regulation of rates for electricity charged by a public utility did not confer state-action immunity for a claim that the utility\xe2\x80\x99s free distribution of light bulbs restrained trade in the light-bulb market.  428 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 596.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, the fact that Georgia imposes limits on entry into the market for medical services, which apply to both hospital authorities and private corporations, does not clearly articulate a policy favoring the consolidation of existing hospitals that are engaged in active competition.  Accord, FTC v. University Health, Inc., 938 F.\xc2\xa02d 1206, 1213, n.\xc2\xa013 (CA11 1991).  As to the Authority\xe2\x80\x99s eminent domain power, it was not exercised here and we do not find it relevant to the question whether the State authorized hospital authorities to consolidate market power through potentially anticompetitive acquisitions of existing hospitals.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, respondents contend that to the extent there is any doubt about whether the clear-articulation test is satisfied in this context, federal courts should err on the side of recognizing immunity to avoid improper interference with state policy choices.  See Brief for Respondents 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  But we do not find the Law ambiguous on the question whether it clearly articulates a policy authorizing anticompetitive acquisitions; it does not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore fundamentally, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suggestion is inconsistent with the principle that \xe2\x80\x9cstate-action immunity is disfavored.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ticor Title, 504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  Parker and its progeny are premised on an understanding that respect for the States\xe2\x80\x99 coordinate role in government counsels against reading the federal antitrust laws to restrict the States\xe2\x80\x99 sovereign capacity to regulate their economies and provide services to their citizens.  But federalism and state sovereignty are poorly served by a rule of construction that would allow \xe2\x80\x9cessential national policies\xe2\x80\x9d embodied in the antitrust laws to be displaced by state delegations of authority \xe2\x80\x9cintended to achieve more limited ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  As an amici brief filed by 20 States in support of the FTC contends, loose application of the clear-articulation test would attach significant unintended consequences to States\xe2\x80\x99 frequent delegations of corporate authority to local bodies, effectively requiring States to disclaim any intent to displace competition to avoid inadvertently authorizing anticompetitive conduct.
