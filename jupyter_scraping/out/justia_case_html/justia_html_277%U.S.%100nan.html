In cases where contract obligations are said to have been impaired by subsequent legislation, contrary to the constitutional restriction, the findings of state courts as to the existence and obligations of the contract are entitled to respect, but do not bind this Court.  <em>Id.</em></p>\n<p>164 Ga. 306, affirmed.</p>\n<p>Error to a judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia sustaining the dismissal of a suit by the petitioner to enjoin the enforcement of a city ordinance fixing rates for water power.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE VAN DEVANTER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a suit brought in a state court in Georgia to restrain the enforcement of an ordinance of the city of Augusta fixing rates for water power supplied from a canal owned and maintained by the city.  The plaintiff is a manufacturing company which operates a mill adjacent to the canal with water power supplied therefrom.  The objection urged against the ordinance is that it is repugnant to the contract clause of the Constitution of the United States, and therefore invalid, in that it impairs the obligation of a prior contract whereby the city undertook to supply water power for the plaintiff\'s mill in perpetuity at a lower rate than that fixed in the ordinance.  The court of first instance held the ordinance valid, and accordingly dismissed the suit.  This was affirmed by the supreme court of the state, 164 Ga. 306, and the case is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="102">Page 277 U. S. 102</a></p><p> here on writ of error allowed by the chief justice of that court.</p>\n<p>Counsel on both sides treat the case as one which rightly may be brought to this Court on writ of error, but some members of the Court doubt that it is such a case.  Therefore this question will be given immediate consideration.</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of this Court to review on writ of error judgments or decrees of state courts of last resort is defined by \xc2\xa7 237(a) of the Judicial Code, as set forth in the amendatory Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936.  As there defined, this jurisdiction extends to two classes of cases:</p>\n<p>(1) "Where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, and the decision is against its validity;"</p>\n<p>(2) "Where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity."</p>\n<p>Plainly the present case is not within the first provision.  Is it within the second?  This depends on the sense in which the words "a statute of any state" are used therein.  If they are used as narrowly comprehending only an enactment of the state legislature, the case is excluded; but, if they are used as broadly comprehending any legislation proceeding from the lawmaking agencies of the state, the case is included.</p>\n<p>In usage, "statute" is a term which has both a restricted and a broad signification.  This is reflection in the following excerpt from Bouvier\'s Law Dictionary, Rawle\'s Revision:</p>\n<p>"STATUTE.  A law established by the act of the legislative power.  An act of the legislature.  The written will of the legislature, solemnly expressed according to the forms necessary to constitute it the law of the state. "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="103">Page 277 U. S. 103</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"This word is used to designate the written law in contradistinction to the unwritten law."</p>\n<p>"Among the civilians, the term \'statute\' is generally applied to laws and regulations of every sort; every provision of law which ordains, permits, or prohibits anything is designated a statute, without considering from what source it arises."</p>\n<p>The Constitution of the United States does not use the term "statute," but it does employ the term "law," often regarded as an equivalent, to describe an exertion of legislative power.  Thus, it is declared that a bill presented in either house of Congress, if receiving prescribed favorable consideration, shall "become a law," Art. I, \xc2\xa7 7; that Congress may "make all laws" necessary and proper for carrying into execution various enumerated powers, Art. I, \xc2\xa7 8, cl. 18; that no stated "shall pass" any "<em>ex post facto</em> law, or law impairing the obligation of contracts," Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 1; that no state "shall make or enforce any law" abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States, Fourteenth Amendment, \xc2\xa7 1; that the Constitution, "laws," and treaties of the United States shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or "laws" of any state to the contrary notwithstanding, Art. VI, cl. 2, and that the judicial power of the United States shall extend, among others, to all cases in law and equity arising under the Constitution, "laws," and treaties of the United States, Art. III, \xc2\xa7 2.</p>\n<p>It, of course, rests with each state to determine in what form and by what agencies its legislative power may be exerted.  It may legislate little or much in its Constitution, may permit the electorate to make laws by direct vote, may intrust its legislature with wide lawmaking functions, and may delegate legislative authority to subordinate agencies, such as municipal councils and state commissions.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="104">Page 277 U. S. 104</a></p><p> But whether this power be exerted in one form or another, or by one agency or another, the enactments put forth, whether called constitutional provisions, laws ordinances, or orders are, in essence, legislative acts of the state; they express its will, and have no force otherwise.  As respects their validity under the Constitution of the United States, all are on the same plane.  If they contravene the restraints which that instrument places on the legislative power of a state, they are invalid, no matter what their form or by what agency put forth; for, as this Court has said, the protection which these restraints afford applies,</p>\n<p>"whatever the form in which the legislative power . . . is exerted -- that is, whether it be by a constitution, an act of the legislature, or an act of any subordinate instrumentality of the state exercising delegated legislative authority, like an ordinance of a municipality or an order of a commission."</p>\n<p><em>Standard Scale Co. v. Farrell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/571/case.html">249 U. S. 571</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/249/571/case.html#577">249 U. S. 577</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The jurisdictional provision we are considering is designed to be in aid of such protection.  It proceeds on the theory that, through inadvertence or design, those who are intrusted with the legislative power of a state may exercise the same in a manner forbidden by the Constitution of the United States, and that the state courts may uphold such legislation when it should be held invalid.  Unlike other state action, legislation consists of rules having continuing force and intended to be observed and applied in the future, and this regardless of the state agency from which it proceeds.</p>\n<p>Were the question an open one, these considerations would afford impelling reasons for holding that the jurisdictional provision uses the words "a statute of any state" in their larger sense, and is not intended to make a distinction between acts of a state legislature and other exertions of the state\'s lawmaking power, but rather to include every act legislative in character to which the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="105">Page 277 U. S. 105</a></p><p> state gives its sanction.  But the question is not an open one; it heretofore has been resolved in keeping with the view just indicated.</p>\n<p>The jurisdictional provision originally was part of \xc2\xa7 25 of the Act of September 24, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 73, 85, which authorized this Court to review on writ of error judgments and decrees of state courts of last resort in cases:</p>\n<p>(1) "Where is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of, or an authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against their validity;"</p>\n<p>(2) "Where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and decision is in favor of such their validity;"</p>\n<p>(3) "Where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party, under such clause of the said Constitution, treaty, statute or commission."</p>\n<p>By the Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, that section was reenacted -- the first and second provisions without change, and the third to read as follows:</p>\n<p>(3) "Where any title, right, privilege, or immunity is claimed under the Constitution, or any treaty or statute of or commission held, or authority exercised under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege, or immunity specially set up or claimed by either party under such Constitution, treaty, statute, commission, or authority."</p>\n<p>The three provisions -- the third as so amended -- were carried into \xc2\xa7 709 of the Revised Statutes of 1873 and into \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code of 1911.  By the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, 39 Stat. 726, the third provision was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="106">Page 277 U. S. 106</a></p><p> eliminated so far as a review on writ of error is concerned, and, by the act of February 13, 1925, <em>supra,</em> the first and second provisions were amended by omitting from both the words "or an authority exercised under," and, with that change, were reenacted in \xc2\xa7 237(a).</p>\n<p>In order that the second provision -- the material one in this case -- and the change made therein may be accurately in mind, we now quote the provision in both its original and its amended form:</p>\n<p>"[Act 1789] where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of such their validity."</p>\n<p>"[Act 1925] where is drawn, in question the validity of a statute of any state, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of its validity."</p>\n<p>It will be seen that the phrase "a statute of any state" has been in the provision from the time of its original enactment, and that this phrase was retained in the reenactment of 1925 without change or qualification.  So its meaning before the reenactment is its meaning now.</p>\n<p>Before coming to decided cases which we deem relevant, it is well to refer to some which, although cited as in point, appear to us not to be so.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v. Charleston,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 449, and <em>Home Insurance Co. v. Augusta,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html">93 U. S. 116</a></span>, are examples.  The first is a case where a tax ordinance of Charleston was sustained by the state court over the objection that it was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States.  This Court\'s jurisdiction was invoked, and was by it sustained, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html#463">27 U. S. 463</a></span>, on the ground that the city\'s action in adopting the ordinance was the "exercise of an <em>authority\'" under the state.  Whether the ordinance was a statute of the state was not considered.  The other case also involved a municipal </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="107">Page 277 U. S. 107</a></em></p><p><em> ordinance which the state court had upheld against the contention that it was in conflict with the contract clause of the Constitution.  This Court took jurisdiction, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html#121">93 U. S. 121</a></span>, on the grounds (a) that the validity of an authority exercised under the state was in question, and (b) that a right claimed under the Constitution was denied.  There was no negation of other grounds.\n</em></p>\n<p><em>Williams v. Bruffy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/176/case.html">96 U. S. 176</a></span>, is the first case in which the phrase "a statute of any state" in the jurisdictional provision was considered and construed.  There, a debt arising on contract and owing by a citizen of Virginia to citizens of Pennsylvania had been sequestrated during the Civil War under an enactment of the Confederate States, and collected from the debtor by that government.  After the war, the creditors brought a suit against the debtor\'s administrator in a state court in Virginia to collect the debt.  The defendant interposed pleas setting up the sequestration and collection under the confederate enactment.  Judgment went for the defendant on these pleas, over the plaintiffs\' objection that the confederate enactment was invalid under the Constitution, and the Supreme court of appeals sustained that ruling.  The case was brought to this Court on writ of error, its jurisdiction being invoked on the grounds that the case was one (a) where the validity of both a statute of the state and an authority under the state was drawn in question as repugnant to the Constitution and was sustained, and (b) where a right, privilege, and immunity claimed under the Constitution was denied.  The jurisdiction was contested, but was sustained expressly on "both" grounds in a considered opinion by Mr. Justice Field, speaking for the entire Court.  In sustaining the first ground, he said, pp.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/96/176/case.html#182">96 U. S. 182</a></span>-183:</p>\n<p>"The pleas aver that a confederation was formed by Virginia and other states called the Confederate States of America, and that, under a law of this confederation, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 277 U. S. 108</a></p><p> enforced in Virginia, the debt due to the plaintiffs was sequestrated.  Now, the Constitution of the United States prohibits any treaty, alliance, or confederation by one state with another.  <em>The organization whose enactment is pleaded cannot therefore be regarded in this Court as having any legal existence.  It follows that whatever efficacy the enactment possessed in Virginia must be attributed to the sanction given to it by that state.</em>  Any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law is a statute of the state within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this Court.  It would be a narrow construction to limit the term to such enactments as have gone through various stages of consideration by the legislature.  There may be many acts authorized by the constitution of a state, or by the convention that framed it, which have not been submitted to the consideration of its legislature, yet have all the efficacy of laws.  By the only authority which can be recognized as having any legal existence -- that is, the state of Virginia -- this act of the unauthorized confederation was enforced as a law of the commonwealth.  Its validity was drawn in question on the ground that it was repugnant to the Constitution of the United States, and the decision of the court below was in favor of its validity."</p>\n<p><em>Ford v. Surget,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/594/case.html">97 U. S. 594</a></span>, is much like the case just cited.  The plaintiff sued in a state court in Mississippi to recover for cotton belonging to him which the defendant had destroyed in that state during the Civil War in obedience to an enactment of the Confederate States.  By special pleas, the defendant set up that enactment in justification of the trespass, and the plaintiff insisted by demurrers that the enactment was contrary to the Constitution.  The demurrers were overruled, and judgment was given for the defendant, which the supreme court affirmed.  The case was brought to this Court by </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 277 U. S. 109</a></p><p> writ of error.  The jurisdiction, although contested, was sustained in an opinion by Mr. Justice Harlan.  He quoted with approval the above extract from <em>Williams v. Bruffy,</em> and added, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/97/594/case.html#603">97 U. S. 603</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"The general orders of the state court overruling the demurrers must be accepted, in every essential sense, as an adjudication in favor of the validity of an act of the Confederate Congress, recognized and enforced as law in Mississippi, and which act, according to the rule laid down in that case, must be therefore regarded by us as a statute of that state within the meaning of the provisions of the act declaring the appellate jurisdiction of this Court.  It results that we have power to review the final judgment of the Supreme Court of Mississippi."</p>\n<p><em>Stevens v. Griffith,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/48/case.html">111 U. S. 48</a></span>, is a case where the Supreme Court of Tennessee had given effect to an enactment of the Confederate States. This Court there said, after reciting its ruling in <em>Williams v. Bruffy,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/111/48/case.html#51">111 U. S. 51</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"So, in this case, the Confederate enactment, under which the confiscation of the money was had, can be treated only as a statute of Tennessee, by whose sanction it was enforced as a law of that state."</p>\n<p><em>New Orleans Water-Works Co. v. Louisiana Sugar Refining Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/18/case.html">125 U. S. 18</a></span>, is a case wherein this Court was asked on writ of error to review a judgment of the Supreme Court of Louisiana giving effect to an ordinance of New Orleans against the contention that it impaired the obligation of a contract.  The opinion was by Mr. Justice Gray.  After stating that, to be within the contract clause of the Constitution, the impairment must be "by a law of the state," and that this Court</p>\n<p>"has no jurisdiction to review a judgment of the highest court of a state, on the ground that the obligation of a contract has been impaired, unless some legislative act of the state has been upheld by the judgment sought to be reviewed,"</p>\n<p>and after quoting with approval the statement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 277 U. S. 110</a></p><p> in <em>Williams v. Bruffy,</em></p>\n<p>"any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which at state gives the force of law, is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this Court,"</p>\n<p>he said, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/125/18/case.html#31">125 U. S. 31</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"So a bylaw or ordinance of a municipal corporation may be such an exercise of legislative power delegated by the legislature to the corporation as a political subdivision of the state, having all the force of law within the limits of the municipality, that it may properly be considered as a law within the meaning of this article of the Constitution of the United States."</p>\n<p>In <em>North American Storage Co. v. Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/306/case.html">211 U. S. 306</a></span>, which came to this Court from a circuit court of the United States, the question was presented whether a municipal ordinance was state action within the clause in the Fourteenth Amendment prohibiting "any state" from denying due process or equal protection.  The Court said, p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/306/case.html#313">211 U. S. 313</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"In this case, the ordinance in question is to be regarded as in effect a statute of the state, adopted under a power granted it by the state legislature, and hence it is an act of the state within the Fourteenth Amendment."</p>\n<p>The construction which was put on the phrase "a statute of any state" in the jurisdictional provisions by the decisions in <em>Williams v. Bruffy, Ford v. Surget,</em> and <em>Stevens v. Griffith</em> did not stop with those cases, but has been approvingly followed and applied in latter cases.</p>\n<p>In <em>Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Goldsboro,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/232/548/case.html">232 U.

With its use elsewhere -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="114">Page 277 U. S. 114</a></p><p> especially in connections indicative of its use in a different sense -- we are not now concerned.</p>\n<p>It is said that the Act of February 13, 1925, which amended the jurisdictional provision, was enacted with the purpose of contracting the obligatory jurisdiction of this Court.  We recognize that there was such a purpose, and that effect should be given to it.  But the act dealt with several jurisdictional provisions, including those relating to cases coming to this Court from the circuit courts of appeals, the district courts, the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia, and the Court of Claims.  It shows that the purpose was to cut down and change our jurisdiction in particular respects, and to leave it as before in others.  We are concerned here with a particular jurisdiction, as to which there was no cutting down or change.  The terms whereby it was defined in the original provision were retained, and thus it was left as before.</p>\n<p>We accordingly hold that the ordinance in question is a statute of the state within the meaning of the jurisdictional provision, and therefore that this case is rightly here on writ of error. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/277/100/case.html">*</a></span>  So we turn to the merits.</p>\n<p>The adoption and terms of the ordinance are not in dispute.  Nor is it questioned that the city became obligated long before the ordinance to supply water power from its canal for the plaintiff\'s mill.  But it is questioned that there was any engagement for a designated price or rate in perpetuity.  Both courts below found for the city of this point.  That finding is entitled to respect, but is not conclusive, for it rests with this Court in cases like this, where contract obligations are said to have been impaired by subsequent legislation contrary to the constitutional restriction, to determine whether there was a contract and what obligations arose from it.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/181/142/case.html">St. Paul Gaslight Co.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="115">Page 277 U.

But it is insisted that a contract arose from conversations and correspondence between representatives of the plaintiff and officers of the city, and that it included an engagement for a designated price or rate in perpetuity.  The proofs have been considered.  It would serve no purpose to review them in this opinion.  We think they fall short of showing any engagement respecting the rate, other than that it was to be the established rate for users in general.  The rate had been fixed by ordinance when the plaintiff obtained the right to have water power supplied to its mill, but there was, as we construe the proofs, no engagement that that rate should continue indefinitely.  The city may be under a duty to supply the power at a reasonable rate (<em>see Millers v. Augusta,</em> 63 Ga. 722), but that question is not in this case.  The plaintiff\'s objection is confined to the asserted impairment of a prior contract.</p>\n<p>Judgment affirmed.</p>\n<p>* Followed in <em>Sprout v. South Bend</em> and <em>Nectow v.

JUSTICE HOLMES concurs), dissenting.</p>\n<p>I think that the writ of error should be dismissed.  The judgment below was entered after the effective date of the Act of February 13, 1925, c. 229, 43 Stat. 936, 937, 942.  That act struck from \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code the Words "or an authority exercised under any state." [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The section as so amended limits the right of review by writ of error to cases where the highest court of a state has denied the validity of a treaty or statute of the United States, or has affirmed the validity of a statute of a state, challenged as repugnant to the Constitution, treaties, or laws of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="116">Page 277 U. S. 116</a></p><p> United States.  Other cases can be reviewed only if this Court, in the exercise of its discretion, grants a writ of certiorari.  Here, the challenge was to the validity of an ordinance of a city.  I cannot believe that, if Congress had intended to maintain our jurisdiction to review judgments sustaining such ordinances on writ of error, it would not have found clearer language in which to express its purpose.</p>\n<p>The question before us is the interpretation not of the word "laws," used in the Constitution, but the narrower term "statute," employed in the Judiciary Act of 1789, c. 20, \xc2\xa7 25, 1 Stat. 73, 85.  And our task is to construe not the single word "statute," but the phrase "statute of any state."  Laws or regulations adopted by a municipality are called, in common speech, either ordinances or bylaws, not "statutes." [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In some connections, rules established by an institution are referred to as statutes.  Thus, the rules adopted by a university or its founder are sometimes spoken of as statutes of the university.  But no one would call them statutes of the state under whose law the university is incorporated.  Nor would anyone, in referring </p><p><a class="page-number" name="117">Page 277 U. S. 117</a></p><p> to the laws or regulations adopted by municipal or other corporations, speak of them as "statutes of the state."  Has the phrase as originally used in \xc2\xa7 25 of the Judiciary Act of September 4, 1789, c. 20, 1 Stat. 72, 85, and as reenacted in \xc2\xa7 2 of the Act of February 5, 1867, c. 28, 14 Stat. 385, 386, in \xc2\xa7 709 of the Revised Statutes, in \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code, and finally in the Act of 1925, acquired a different, a conventional, meaning, so that it must be held to include municipal ordinances?</p>\n<p>Our jurisdiction to review a judgment of a state court sustaining the validity of a municipal ordinance alleged to be repugnant to the federal Constitution was first invoked in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/449/case.html">Weston v.

Section 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which was then in force without amendment, authorized a review by writ of error in any case</p>\n<p>"where is drawn in question the validity of a statute of, or an authority exercised under any state, on the ground of their being repugnant to the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States, and the decision is in favor of such their validity, or where is drawn in question the construction of any clause of the Constitution, or of a treaty, or statute of, or commission held under the United States, and the decision is against the title, right, privilege or exemption specially set up or claimed by either party, under such clause of the said Constitution, treaty, statute or commission."</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction having been questioned, because of the nature of the proceeding, Mr. Chief Justice Marshall took occasion to specify the clause of \xc2\xa7 25 on which he conceived the jurisdiction to rest:</p>\n<p>"In this case, the city ordinance of Charleston is the exercise of an \'authority under the State of South Carolina,\' \'the validity of which has been drawn in question, on the ground of its being repugnant to the Constitution,\' and \'the decision is in favour of its validity.\' "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="118">Page 277 U. S. 118</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The jurisdiction then declared was exercised, without question, in the cases involving municipal ordinances that came before the Court during the next half century. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In 1876, the subject was carefully reconsidered in <em>Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html">93 U. S. 116</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html#118">93 U. S. 118</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html#121">93 U. S. 121</a></span>.  After stating the possible bases of jurisdiction under \xc2\xa7 709 of the Revised Statutes, the Court said:</p>\n<p>"Here there was drawn in question the authority exercised by the city council under the state in passing the ordinance imposing the tax complained of.  The question raised was as to its repugnancy to the Constitution of the United States, and the decision was in favor of the validity of the authority so exercised.  A right was also claimed under the Constitution of the United States.  The decision was adverse to the claim.  The case is therefore within two of the categories we have stated.  The jurisdictional objection cannot be maintained."</p>\n<p>The Court would hardly have omitted to say that review might also have been had by virtue of the "statute" clause if it had been of opinion that a municipal ordinance could be properly so described.</p>\n<p>The second of the categories mentioned in <em>Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta</em> was eliminated, so far as the right to review by writ of error was concerned, by the Act of September 6, 1916, c. 448, \xc2\xa7 2, 39 Stat. 726.  In cases where the showing was merely that a title, right, privilege, or immunity guaranteed by the Constitution had been claimed and denied, that act provided that there could be no review except by certiorari.  But, as it left unchanged the clause regarding the validity of an authority on which Mr. Chief Justice Marshall had based the power of this Court of review judgments sustaining municipal ordinances, our jurisdiction over such judgments remained unaffected.  When, in 1925, the "authority" clause was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="119">Page 277 U. S. 119</a></p><p> struck from \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code and our jurisdiction on writ of error under that \xc2\xa7 was limited to cases involving the validity of a statute, Congress cannot have been unaware of the difference, for jurisdictional purposes, between a statute of a state and a municipal ordinance.  For attention had been called to the difference by numerous decisions under several jurisdictional acts, the most recent being of wide public interest.</p>\n<p>The Act of June 18, 1910, c. 309, 36 Stat. 539, 557, \xc2\xa7 17 of which was embodied in the Judicial Code as \xc2\xa7 266, declared that</p>\n<p>"no interlocutory injunction suspending or restraining the enforcement, operation, or execution of any statute of a state by restraining the action of any officer of such state in the enforcement or execution of such statute"</p>\n<p>should issue except upon a hearing before three judges as there provided.  An unbroken line of decisions, beginning in 1911, has held that a municipal ordinance is not a statute within the meaning of that section.  <em>Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Co. v. City of Tacoma,</em> 190 F. 682; <em>Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. City of Memphis,</em> 198 F. 955; <em>Birmingham Waterworks Co. v. City of Birmingham,</em> 211 F. 497, <em>aff\'d,</em> 213 F. 450; <em>Calhoun v. City of Seattle,</em> 215 F. 226; <em>City of Des Moines v. Des Moines Gas Co.,</em> 264 F. 506; <em>City of Dallas v. Dallas Telephone Co.,</em> 272 F. 410.  <em>See also Land Development Co. v. City of New Orleans,</em> 13 F.2d 898, <em>reversed on the merits,</em> 17 F.2d 1016.  The principal ground of these decisions, namely, "that the natural meaning of "statute of a state" is a statute or law directly passed by the legislature of the state, and the natural meaning of "any officer of such state" is an officer whose authority extends throughout the state, and is not limited to a small district" (<em>Cumberland Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. v. City of Memphis,</em> 198 F. 955, 957), is, of course, equally applicable to \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code.  It cannot have been unknown to Congress.  The construction had already been established when the Act of March 4, 1913, c. 160, 37 Stat. 1013, amended \xc2\xa7 266 so as to make </p><p><a class="page-number" name="120">Page 277 U. S. 120</a></p><p> it clearly applicable to suits to enjoin the orders of a state commission. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The amending act inserted, after the words "in the enforcement or execution of such statute," the words</p>\n<p>"or in the enforcement or execution of an order made by an administrative board or commission acting under an pursuant to the statutes of such state."</p>\n<p>Congress did not include in the amendment any reference to municipal ordinances.  The fact that it did not is significant. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="121">Page 277 U. S. 121</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Prior to the Act of 1925, the difference, for purposes of appellate review, between a statute and a law enacted by a subordinate legislative body had been called to the attention of Congress also by the cases which settled that the enactments of the legislatures and other lawmaking bodies of the territories and of the District of Columbia are not statutes of the United States within the meaning of legislation governing the jurisdiction of this Court.  The question appears to have arisen first under the Act of March 3, 1885, c. 355, \xc2\xa7 2, 23 Stat. 443.  The phraseology of this statute was similar to that of \xc2\xa7 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, and this Court has always recognized that decisions under it and its later reenactments are authoritative with regard to the construction of \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  It permitted </p><p><a class="page-number" name="122">Page 277 U. S. 122</a></p><p> review of any judgment of the Supreme Court of a territory or of the District of Columbia where "is drawn in question the validity of a treaty or statute of or an authority exercised under the United States."  Thereafter that provision, as modified by the act creating the Court of Appeals for the District, February 9, 1893, c. 74, \xc2\xa7 8, 27 Stat. 434, 436, District Code, \xc2\xa7 233, 31 Stat. 1189, 1227, governed our appellate jurisdiction over the highest courts of the continental territories (other than Alaska) and of the District until the enactment of the Judicial Code, in which it was embodied as \xc2\xa7 245 (36 Stat. 1158) and, with important changes, as \xc2\xa7 250.  That our appellate jurisdiction over judgments involving the validity of acts of territorial legislatures and of the legislative body of the District depended on the clause in the Act of 1885 allowing such review where the validity of an authority exercised under the United States had been challenged was indicated in <em>Maricopa &amp; Phoenix R. Co. v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/156/347/case.html">156 U.

S. 124</a></p><p> the ordinances of the District of Columbia, even where the enabling act provides that the ordinances shall have the same force as if enacted by the Congress of the United States.</p>\n<p>Moreover, if municipal ordinances are deemed to be statutes of a state within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 237(a) of the Judicial Code, legislative orders of state commissions, boards, and officials must be also.  Prior to the Act of 1925, judgments sustaining the validity of such orders were reviewable on writ of error as fully as judgments sustaining the validity of statutes and ordinances.  Between the effective date of the Act of 1916 and that of the Act of 1925, this Court wrote opinions in 21 cases in which a judgment of the highest court of a state involving the validity of an order of a commission was reviewed on writ of error. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In none of the opinions was it stated that jurisdiction existed because an order is a statute of state. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  On the other hand, in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/267/427/case.html">Lancaster v.

[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>The difference between a statute and an ordinance for purposes of appellate review -- a difference which rests wholly on expediency -- had been acted upon by Congress half a century earlier, when it undertook to deal with the congestion of business in this Court by regulating the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="126">Page 277 U.

[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  It was reaffirmed when Congress, in 1925, withdrew the right to a direct appeal from the district court in cases involving the validity of municipal ordinances, though allowing such an appeal in certain cases involving the validity of statutes and orders of commissions.  On the other hand, the essential identity of statutes, ordinances, and orders, where the question concerns substantive rights, has always been recognized.  Since all regulations established by competent authority are laws, the comprehensive term "laws" has been used when it was desired to include all forms of legislative action. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Thus, as the enactments of a subordinate body exercising legislative authority are a part of the laws of a state, an ordinance or an order is a law within the meaning of the contract clause, and is state action within the prohibitions of the Fourteenth Amendment.  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/211/306/case.html">North</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="127">Page 277 U.

But, in 1925, Congress amended \xc2\xa7 238 so as to confine the right to a direct appeal in cases involving the validity of state action to those which fell within the provisions of \xc2\xa7 266 -- provisions which had already been construed as not including municipal ordinances.  Unless the phrase "statute of any state," as used in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 237(a) and 240(b) of the Judicial Code as amended, includes municipal ordinances, no case from any lower court involving only the validity of a municipal ordinance can now be reviewed by this Court otherwise than upon certiorari.</p>\n<p>When it is borne in mind that the severe limitations upon the right of review by this Court -- imposed by the Act of 1925 -- were made solely because the increase of the Court\'s business compelled, the reasons why Congress should have taken away the right to a review by writ of error to the highest court of a state in cases involving the validity of ordinances, while leaving unaffected the right in cases involving the validity of statutes, becomes clear.  There are only 48 states. In 1920, there were 924 municipalities in the United States of more than 8,000 inhabitants. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The validity of ordinances of even smaller municipalities had come to this Court for adjudication. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="129">Page 277 U. S. 129</a></p><p> The increasingly complex conditions of urban life have led, as this Court noted in <em>Village of Euclid v. Ambler Realty Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/case.html">272 U.

Recently, two classes of municipal ordinances, new in character -- those relating to zoning and those relating to motor vehicles -- had become the subject of many controversies.  The constitutionality of these ordinances can rarely be determined simply by applying a general rule.  The Court must consider the effect of the ordinance as applied.  As the validity of the particular ordinance depends ordinarily upon special facts, [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] these must be examined whenever there is jurisdiction.  <em>Dahnke-Walker Milling Co. v. Bondurant,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/257/282/case.html">257 U. S. 282</a></span>.  Though no burdensome factual inquiry is involved, the controversy may often be of trifling significance, as in the case at bar.  Thus, persuasive reasons existed why Congress should have denied, in 1925, review by writ of error in cases which involved only the validity of a municipal ordinance.</p>\n<p>If, by striking out from \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code the clause, "or an authority exercised under any state," Congress did not exclude from review by writ of error cases involving the validity of municipal ordinances and commission orders, it wholly failed to accomplish what, in view of the statements made to it in regard to the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="130">Page 277 U. S. 130</a></p><p> effect of the amendment, [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>] must be deemed to have been its purpose in so amending the section -- that is, to relieve this Court, in many cases, of the burden of obligatory review.  For, other than these, there had been considered by this Court, in the nine years between the effective dates of the Jurisdictional Acts of 1916 and 1925, and decided with opinions, not more than eight cases involving the validity of an authority exercised under a state or under the United States. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]  On the other hand, the forty cases in which judgments of state courts sustaining municipal ordinances or commission orders had been reviewed on writ of error had entailed a burden out of all proportion to their number.  The evidence introduced to establish the facts in cases involving the validity either of orders or of municipal ordinances is often both voluminous </p><p><a class="page-number" name="131">Page 277 U. S. 131</a></p><p> and conflicting. [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  Condensation of the evidence is not required, as in cases coming from the lower federal courts.  <em>See</em> Equity Rule 75(b), 226 U.S. Appendix 23; Rule 7(2), 266 U.S. 657, 658.  <em>Compare Barber Asphalt Paving Co. v.

During that period, the Court wrote opinions in a multitude of cases in which that specific jurisdiction was exercised.  In only two of them has there been found any statement that the jurisdiction could be sustained on the ground that a municipal ordinance is a statute of a state within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 25 of the Judiciary Act of 1789 or its later reenactments.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="132">Page 277 U.

An examination of the record and briefs in the two cases seems to make it clear that the statements were <em>obiter,</em> and were made inadvertently.  No question of the jurisdiction of this Court under \xc2\xa7 237 of the Judicial Code was raised or discussed by counsel in either case, and this Court could not, under the legislation then in force, have entertained a doubt as to the existence of the jurisdiction.

That case involved an act of the Congress of the Confederate States -- a body whose legislation would obviously be described in common speech as "statutes."  It was conceded that the particular act was a "statute."  The question was whether it was a statute "of any state." [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  The Court </p><p><a class="page-number" name="133">Page 277 U. S. 133</a></p><p> held that, since the enactment had been given the force of law in Virginia, it was as much the action of that state as if it had been originally passed by an authorized legislative body.  In being so adopted by Virginia, the enactment clearly did not lose the quality which it had had from its inception -- namely, that of being a "statute."  It was in this connection that Mr. Justice Field said:</p>\n<p>"Any enactment, from whatever source originating, to which a state gives the force of law is a statute of the state, within the meaning of the clause cited relating to the jurisdiction of this Court."</p>\n<p>This language was used with reference to the acts of an irregular legislative body whose enactments would be commonly described as "statutes."  It had no reference to the acts of a regular legislative body whose enactments would never be characterized as statutes in ordinary speech.  That Mr. Justice Field would not so have applied it is clear, for, in the term of court preceding that in which <em>Williams v. Bruffy</em> was decided, he had participated in the decision in <em>Home Insurance Co. v. City Council of Augusta,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/93/116/case.html">93 U.

Some care seems to have been taken not to repeat the expression that a municipal ordinance was a statute of a state.  <em>See Thomas Cusack Co. v.
