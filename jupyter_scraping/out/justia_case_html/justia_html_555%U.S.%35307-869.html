The District Court upheld the ban at the state level, but struck it down as it applies to local governments.  In affirming, the Ninth Circuit stated that, while Idaho has the ultimate control over local governmental units, it did not actually operate or control their payroll deduction systems.

Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.  Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s public employee unions are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.  They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.  Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s decision to limit public employee payroll deductions as it has does not infringe the unions\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights.  The State accordingly need only demonstrate a rational basis to justify the ban.

He may not, however, choose to have an amount deducted and remitted to the union\xe2\x80\x99s political action committee, because Idaho law prohibits payroll deductions for political activities.  A group of unions representing Idaho public employees challenged this limitation.  They conceded that the limitation was valid as applied at the state level, but argued that it violated their First Amendment rights when applied to county, municipal, school district, and other local public employers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not agree.  The First Amendment prohibits government from \xe2\x80\x9cabridging the freedom of speech\xe2\x80\x9d; it does not confer an affirmative right to use government payroll mechanisms for the purpose of obtaining funds for expression.  Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s law does not restrict political speech, but rather declines to promote that speech by allowing public employee checkoffs for political activities.  Such a decision is reasonable in light of the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding the appearance that carrying out the public\xe2\x80\x99s business is tainted by partisan political activity.  That interest extends to government at the local as well as state level, and nothing in the First Amendment prevents a State from determining that its political subdivisions may not provide payroll deductions for political activities.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s Right to Work Act declares that the \xe2\x80\x9cright to work shall not be infringed or restricted in any way based on membership in, affiliation with, or financial support of a labor organization or on refusal to join, affiliate with, or financially or otherwise support a labor organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  1985 Idaho Sess. Laws ch. 2, \xc2\xa71 (codified at Idaho Code \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932001 (Michie 2003)).  As part of that policy, the Act prohibits any requirement for the payment of dues or fees to a labor organization as a condition of employment, \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932003, but authorizes employers to deduct union fees from an employee\xe2\x80\x99s wages with the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csigned written authorization,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(1).  The Act covers all employees, \xe2\x80\x9cincluding all employees of the state and its political subdivisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932011.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Prior to 2003, employees could authorize both a payroll deduction for general union dues and a payroll deduction for union political activities conducted through a political action committee.  App. 55\xe2\x80\x9356, 83\xe2\x80\x9384.  In 2003, the Idaho Legislature passed the Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA).  2003 Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932601 through 44\xe2\x80\x932605, and \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004).  That legislation, among other things, amended the Right to Work Act by adding a prohibition on payroll deductions for political purposes.  That amendment provides: \xe2\x80\x9cDeductions for political activities as defined in chapter 26, title 44, Idaho Code, shall not be deducted from the wages, earnings or compensation of an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2).  The term \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical activities\xe2\x80\x9d is defined as \xe2\x80\x9celectoral activities, independent expenditures, or expenditures made to any candidate, political party, political action committee or political issues committee or in support of or against any ballot measure.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932602(1)(e).  Violations of \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) are punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or up to 90 days of imprisonment, or both.  \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932007.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly before the VCA was to take effect, plaintiff labor organizations sued the Bannock County prosecuting attorney, the Idaho secretary of state, and the Idaho attorney general in their official capacities, alleging that the ban on political payroll deductions was unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.  App. 18\xe2\x80\x9341.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The District Court rejected that argument with respect to public employers at the state level, concluding that the First Amendment does not compel the State \xe2\x80\x9cto subsidize speech by providing, at its own expense, payroll deductions for the purpose of paying union dues or association fees for State employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Heideman,</em> 2005 WL 3241745, *2 (D Idaho, Nov. 23, 2005).  The ban was valid at the state level because \xe2\x80\x9cthe State is incurring costs to set up and maintain the [payroll deduction] program.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.  </em>The court struck down the VCA, however, \xe2\x80\x9cto the extent that it applies to local governments and private employers,\xe2\x80\x9d because the State had failed to identify any subsidy it provided to such employers to administer payroll deductions.  <em>Id</em>., at *2 (footnote omitted), *6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The state defendants appealed, contending that the ban on political payroll deductions may be constitutionally applied to local government employees.  <em>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Heideman,</em> 504 F.\xc2\xa03d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007). Neither party challenged the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings as to private and state-level employees, and therefore the only issue remaining concerned application of the ban to local government employees.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno subsidy by the State of Idaho for the payroll deduction systems of local governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1059.  The appellate court remarked that \xe2\x80\x9cthe generalized lawmaking power held by the legislature with respect to a state\xe2\x80\x99s political subdivisions does not establish that the state is acting as a proprietor\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to local government employers.  <em>Id</em>., at 1064.  The court instead regarded the relationship between the State and its political subdivisions as analogous to that between the State and a regulated private utility.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1063\xe2\x80\x931065 (citing <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Public Serv.

While \xe2\x80\x9cIdaho has the ultimate power of control over the units of government at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d it did not \xe2\x80\x9cactually operat[e] or contro[l] the payroll deduction systems of local units of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1068.  The court therefore applied strict scrutiny to Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s decision to prevent local government employers from allowing payroll deductions for political purposes, and held the statute unconstitutional as applied at the local level.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 552 U.

The unions assert that the ban on checkoffs for political activities falls into this category because the law singles out political speech for disfavored treatment.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The First Amendment, however, protects the right to be free from government abridgment of speech.  While in some contexts the government must accommodate expression, it is not required to assist others in funding the expression of particular ideas, including political ones.  \xe2\x80\x9c[A] legislature\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right, and thus is not subject to strict scrutiny.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Regan</em> v. <em>Taxation With Representation of Wash.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/540/index.html"></a><a href="/us/461/540/index.html">461 U.

But the parties agree that the State is not constitutionally obligated to provide payroll deductions at all.  See Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Reply Memorandum 10; see also <em>Toledo Area AFL\xe2\x80\x93CIO Council </em>v.<em> Pizza</em>, 154 F.\xc2\xa03d 307, 319\xe2\x80\x93320 (CA6 1998); cf. <em>Charlotte</em> v. <em>Firefighters</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/426/283/index.html">426 U.

While publicly administered payroll deductions for political purposes can enhance the unions\xe2\x80\x99 exercise of First Amendment rights, Idaho is under no obligation to aid the unions in their political activities.  And the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to do so is not an abridgment of the unions\xe2\x80\x99 speech; they are free to engage in such speech as they see fit.  They simply are barred from enlisting the State in support of that endeavor.

The prohibition is not \xe2\x80\x9caim[ed] at the suppression of dangerous ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 548 (internal quotation marks omitted), but is instead justified by the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics.  We have previously recognized such a purpose in upholding limitations on public employee political activities.  See <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Letter Carriers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/index.html">413 U.

Banning payroll deductions for political speech similarly furthers the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in distinguishing between internal governmental operations and private speech. Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s decision to allow payroll deductions for some purposes but not for political activities is plainly reasonable.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Davenport</em> guides our resolution here.  That case also involved a distinction based on the content of speech:  Specific consent was required from nonunion members before agency fees charged to them could be used for election-related activities, but consent was not required with respect to agency fees used for other purposes.  551 U. S., at 181\xe2\x80\x93182.  We rejected the unions\xe2\x80\x99 argument that this requirement violated the First Amendment because it turned on the content of the speech at issue.  <em>Id</em>., at 188\xe2\x80\x93190.  We recognized that the statute, rather than suppressing union speech, simply declined to assist that speech by granting the unions the right to charge agency fees for election activities.  That decision was reasonable given the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preserving the integrity of the election process.  <em>Ibid.  </em>We also concluded that the State did \xe2\x80\x9cnot have to enact an across-the-board limitation\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0to vindicate [its] more narrow concern.\xe2\x80\x9d <em> Id</em>., at 189.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here the restriction is on the use of a checkoff to fund political activities, but the same analysis governs.  Idaho does not suppress political speech but simply declines to promote it through public employer checkoffs for political activities. The concern that political payroll deductions might be seen as involving public employers in politics arises only because Idaho permits public employer payroll deductions in the first place.  As in <em>Davenport</em>, the State\xe2\x80\x99s response to that problem is limited to its source\xe2\x80\x94in this case, political payroll deductions.  The ban on such deductions plainly serves the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in separating public employment from political activities.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question remains whether the ban is valid at the local level.  The unions abandoned their challenge to the restriction at the state level, but contend that strict scrutiny is still warranted when the ban is applied to local government employers.  In that context, the unions argue, the State is no longer declining to facilitate speech through its own payroll system, but is obstructing speech in the local governments\xe2\x80\x99 payroll systems.  See Brief for Respondents 44\xe2\x80\x9346.

But we are aware of no case suggesting that a different analysis applies under the First Amendment depending on the level of government affected, and the unions have cited none.  The ban on political payroll deductions furthers Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s interest in separating the operation of government from partisan politics.  That interest extends to all public employers at whatever level of government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In reaching the opposite conclusion, the Court of Appeals invoked our decision in <em>Consolidated Edison Co. of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em> v. <em>Public Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/530/index.html"></a><a href="/us/447/530/index.html">447 U. S. 530</a>.  In that case, we held that a state commission could not, consistent with the First Amendment, prohibit a privately owned electric utility from discussing controversial issues in its bill inserts.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 544.  We ruled that the fact that the State regulated the utility did not authorize the prohibition.  <em>Id.</em>, at 540.  The Court of Appeals concluded that the same analysis applied here, and that \xe2\x80\x9cthe State\xe2\x80\x99s broad powers of control over local government entities are solely those of a regulator, analogous to the [state commission\xe2\x80\x99s] regulatory power over [the private utility].\xe2\x80\x9d  504 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1065.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That analogy is misguided.  A private corporation is subject to the government\xe2\x80\x99s legal authority to regulate its conduct.  A political subdivision, on the other hand, is a subordinate unit of government created by the State to carry out delegated governmental functions.  A private corporation enjoys constitutional protections, see <em>First Nat. Bank of Boston</em> v. <em>Bellotti</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/435/765/index.html">435 U. S. 765</a>, 778, n. 14 (1978), but a political subdivision, \xe2\x80\x9ccreated by the state for the better ordering of government, has no privileges or immunities under the federal constitution which it may invoke in opposition to the will of its creator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Mayor of Baltimore</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/289/36/index.html">289 U. S. 36</a>, 40 (1933); see <em>Trenton</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 185 (municipality, as successor to a private water company, does not enjoy against the State the same constitutional rights as the water company: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he relations existing between the State and the water company were not the same as those between the State and the City\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals found it significant that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no subsidy by the State of Idaho for the payroll deduction systems of local governments.\xe2\x80\x9d  504 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1059; see also 2005 WL 3241745, *2.

Given the relationship between the State and its political subdivisions, however, it is immaterial how the State allocates funding or management responsibilities between the different levels of government.  The question is whether the State must affirmatively assist political speech by allowing public employers to administer payroll deductions for political activities.  For the reasons set forth in this opinion, the answer is no.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals ruling that Idaho Code \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) is unconstitutional with respect to local units of government is reversed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The unions also challenged other provisions of the VCA, including one requiring labor organizations to establish a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate segregated fund\xe2\x80\x9d for political activities.

A decision not to assist fundraising that may, as a practical matter, result in fewer contributions is simply not the same as directly limiting expression.

The parties agree here, as they did in the Court of Appeals, that Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s ban on payroll deductions for political activities violates First Amendment limitations as applied to the private sector.  They also agree here, as they did before the Ninth Circuit, that the ban is permissible as applied to state-level government entities.  See <em>ante</em>, at 4, 9; Tr. of Oral Arg. 4.  The sole question posed for this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is the appropriate placement of the State\xe2\x80\x99s political subdivisions: For the purpose at hand, should the Court align local-government employment with private-sector employment or with state-level employment?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGiven the relationship between the State and its political subdivisions,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court persuasively explains, \xe2\x80\x9cit is immaterial how the State allocates funding or management responsibilities between the different levels of government.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.

So far as Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s law affects freedom of expression, I am not persuaded there is sufficient reason to treat the State\xe2\x80\x99s statutory prohibition differently depending on the unit of its government employing the worker whose salary deduction would fund political activity.  There is no question in this case that the lower echelons of Idaho government are creatures of the State exercising state power in discharging what are ultimately state responsibilities.  Nor is there any apparent reason to think the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted legitimate interest differs according to the level of government doing the State\xe2\x80\x99s work, whether that interest is having a firewall between public administration and politics or simply exercising a power to decide whether public employees who administer payrolls should spend work time advancing private political speech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I find it impossible to stop there.  Although this case comes to us as one about the scope of the public business the State is free, within reasonable limits, to manage as it thinks wise, the specter of another First Amendment category, one of superior significance, is too insistent to ignore.  It is true that government may choose to manage its own affairs in ways that draw reasonable subject-matter lines affecting speech, being free, for example, to sell space on its buses for advertising soap but not politicians.  See <em>Lehman</em> v. <em>Shaker Heights</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/298/index.html">418 U. S. 298</a> (1974).  But a government is not free to draw those lines as a way to discourage or suppress the expression of viewpoints it disagrees with, <em>Cornelius</em> v. <em>NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/788/index.html">473 U. S. 788</a>, 806, 811\xe2\x80\x93812, (1985); <em>Perry Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Perry Local Educators\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/37/index.html">460 U. S. 37</a>, 46, 49 (1983); only narrow tailoring to serve a compelling state interest could justify that kind of selectivity, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/803/index.html">529 U. S. 803</a>, 813 (2000).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This difference between viewpoint discrimination and neutral regulation of governmental activity is on point in this case.  For although the State invokes its legitimate interest in keeping public administration free from political involvement as its reason for Idaho Code \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) (Michie 2003), this ostensibly viewpoint-neutral rationale suffers from the circumstances Justice Stevens describes in detail, see <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion).  Every other provision of the amendatory act in which \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) was included deals with unions, the statute amended regulates unions, and all this legislation is placed in the State\xe2\x80\x99s labor law codification.  <em>Ante.</em>, at 2.  Union speech, and nothing else, seems to have been on the legislative mind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s answer to this recalls <em>Davenport</em> v. <em>Washington Ed. Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/177/index.html">551 U. S. 177</a> (2007), in suggesting that Idaho was merely limiting a self-created risk of entangling public administration with politics, which followed from authorizing public payroll deductions for union benefit in the first place, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 7\xe2\x80\x938.  But the scope of the state enactment that imposes the prohibition places that explanation in question, for the statute goes beyond constraining the government as employer, and criminalizes deductions for political purposes even when administered by private employers, an application of the law the State concedes is unconstitutional.  <em>Pocatello Ed. Assn.</em> v. <em>Heideman</em>, 504 F.\xc2\xa03d 1053, 1057 (CA9 2007).  Hence a reader of the statute may fairly suspect that Idaho\xe2\x80\x99s legislative object was not efficient, clean government, but that unions\xe2\x80\x99 political viewpoints were its target, selected out of all the politics the State might filter from its public workplaces.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0What to do about this reasonable suspicion of viewpoint discrimination is a dilemma.  We can hardly disregard it, for it affects the weight this case can carry as precedent; a decision that ignores the elephant in the room is a decision with diminished authority.  But the potential issue of viewpoint discrimination that should be addressed in this case is not before us.  Although the unions\xe2\x80\x99 brief alludes to viewpoint discrimination in several places, that is not the focus of their argument.  The unions, instead, aim at showing that the State is acting as a regulator of local governments (much as it regulates private corporations), not as a manager setting limits to what government will do with public resources; consequently they rest their position on the argument that any state discrimination against political speech is illegitimate, however consistently all shades of political speech may be treated.  And even if we could properly recast the case by remanding to consider viewpoint discrimination, see <em>Cornelius</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 811\xe2\x80\x93812, a remand could only affect the application of the statute to subordinate units of government; the unions have accepted the constitutionality of applying the law to the State, where an effort at viewpoint discrimination would be as unconstitutional as it would be at the level of a town.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that if we decide the case as it comes to us we will shut our eyes to a substantial, if not the substantial, issue raised by the facts.  But if we were to expand the issues presented to us by remanding for enquiry into viewpoint discrimination, we would risk having to wink later at an unconstitutional application of the law to the State, owing to the unions\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to challenge that application either in the Ninth Circuit or before us.  This is a good description of a case that should not be in this Court as a vehicle to refine First Amendment doctrine.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently granted, and I respectfully dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962849">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nYSURSA V.

For decades, employers in Idaho had discretion to allow such payroll deductions.  In 2003, however, the State enacted the Voluntary Contributions Act (VCA), 2003 Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004, and \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932601 through 44\xe2\x80\x932605 (Michie 2003)), which, among other things, prohibits employers from allowing any payroll deduction for \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical activities,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2).  For several reasons, I cannot conclude as the Court does that this restriction on payroll deductions was reasonably calculated to further the State\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in separating the operation of government from partisan politics,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10.  Because it is clear to me that the restriction was intended to make it more difficult for unions to finance political speech, I would hold it unconstitutional in all its applications.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIt is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based on its substantive content or the message it conveys.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rosenberger</em> v. <em>Rector and Visitors of Univ. of Va.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/819/index.html">515 U.

On its face, \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) restricts payroll deductions for all political activities, and petitioners contend that the State reasonably enacted \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) \xe2\x80\x9cto avoid either the appearance or the reality of public employer involvement in \xe2\x80\xa6 electoral politics.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.  Several features of the statute, however, belie its purported viewpoint neutrality.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the restriction was more narrowly intended to target union fundraising is first evidenced by its statutory context.  The other provisions of the VCA with which \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) was enacted pertain exclusively to unions.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  For instance, \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932603 requires unions to create separate funds for political activities and places restrictions on unions\xe2\x80\x99 solicitation of political contributions; \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932604 makes it a misdemeanor, among other things, for unions to make expenditures for political activities from union dues; and \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932605 establishes registration and reporting requirements for union political funds.  The provisions proximate to \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2), which were enacted roughly two decades earlier as part of the Right to Work Act, 1985 Sess. Laws ch. 2, \xc2\xa71 (codified at Idaho Code \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932001 <em>et seq.</em>), are similarly directed at union activities.  Even the subsection immediately preceding \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) is aimed specifically at unions: \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(1) prohibits payroll deductions for union dues, fees, assessments, or other charges without an employee\xe2\x80\x99s prior written authorization.  And, finally, \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) is codified in a title of the Idaho Code entitled \xe2\x80\x9cLabor\xe2\x80\x9d and in a chapter entitled \xe2\x80\x9cRight to Work.\xe2\x80\x9d  Together, these statutory features strongly suggest that the Idaho Legislature enacted \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) specifically to impede union fundraising.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory purpose is further evidenced by its substantial overinclusiveness and underinclusiveness with respect to the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in passing the legislation.  Petitioners contend that the restriction was enacted to further the State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding the appearance or actuality of public employer involvement in partisan politics.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.  But, as enacted, \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) prohibited private as well as public employers from making payroll deductions for political activities.  As petitioners admitted at oral argument, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State has no interest in \xe2\x80\xa6 private employers\xe2\x80\x99 determination to be involved or not involved in political matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 6.  That petitioners conceded the invalidity of \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) as applied to private employers earlier in this litigation does not require us to ignore the breadth of the statute the State enacted in assessing the provision\xe2\x80\x99s scope and purpose.  Consideration of the provision actually passed by the legislature makes clear that the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in the restriction is not compatible with its breadth.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State\xe2\x80\x99s interest in avoiding the appearance or reality of employer political involvement is also inconsistent with its decision not<em> </em>to restrict deductions for charitable activities.  Such deductions will often present a similar risk of creating an appearance of political involvement as deductions for covered political activities.  Yet the State has made no effort to distinguish this type of political activity.  As with the State\xe2\x80\x99s decision to apply \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) to private employers, its failure to apply the restriction to charitable deductions produces a significant mismatch between the restriction\xe2\x80\x99s reach and its asserted purpose.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To my mind, it is clear from these features of the legislation that \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on payroll deductions for \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical activities\xe2\x80\x9d was intended to target union political activity.

See <em>Reynolds</em> v. <em>Sims</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/533/index.html">377 U. S. 533</a>, 575 (1964).  Hence the fact that a state statute, rather than a municipal ordinance, limits the use of the municipality\xe2\x80\x99s payroll deduction system is beside the point.  I agree that this is so, and I agree with Justice Souter\xe2\x80\x99s discussion about the  relationship between the state and the municipality.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not agree, however, with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s further analysis of the pertinent legal question\xe2\x80\x94whether the state statute violates the First Amendment.  Nor do I agree with its ultimate conclusion.  Rather, in my view, we should remand this case for further consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\n      The Court\xe2\x80\x99s First Amendment analysis emphasizes its characterization of the statute as not \xe2\x80\x9cabridging\xe2\x80\x9d a union\xe2\x80\x99s or a worker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom of speech,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cdeclin[ing] to promote\xe2\x80\x9d that speech.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (internal quotation marks omitted).  I agree that the First Amendment does not prohibit government from \xe2\x80\x9c<em>declining to promote</em>\xe2\x80\x9d speech.  It says that government shall not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>abridg[e]</em> the freedom of speech.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added) .  But I do not think the distinction particularly useful in this case.  </p>\n<p>\n\n     That is because here the distinction is neither easy to draw nor likely to prove determinative.  Sometimes, I concede, the distinction may help.  Were there no payroll deduction system at all and were the unions arguing for the creation of such a system from scratch, one might characterize their claim as seeking the <em>promotion </em>of speech.  But that is not the situation here.  A deduction system already exists.  The unions attack a separate statutory provision that removes politically related deductions from that system.  And linguistically speaking, one need not characterize such an attack as (1) seeking speech <em>promotion</em> rather than (2) seeking to prevent an <em>abridgment </em>of political-speech-related activity that otherwise (<em>i.e.</em>, in the absence of the exception) would occur.  In such an instance, the debate over characterization is more metaphysical than practical.</p>\n<p>\n\n      More importantly, the characterization quite possibly does not matter.   Suppose, for example, a somewhat similar statutory exception picks and chooses among political causes, prohibiting deductions that help one political party while permitting deductions that help another.  The First Amendment result could not turn upon whether one described the exception as an \xe2\x80\x9cabridgment\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9cpromotion\xe2\x80\x9d failure.  And, as I shall explain, <em>infra, </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936, such may be the case here.</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em><f f="Century Schoolbook"> </f></em>     I disagree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s characterizations in another respect.  The Court says that because the exception \xe2\x80\x9chas not infringed the unions\xe2\x80\x99 First Amendment rights,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d does not apply and, thus, the State \xe2\x80\x9cneed only demonstrate <em>a rational basis</em>\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the standard of review applicable to any ordinary legislation that does not infringe fundamental rights\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cto justify the ban on political payroll deductions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (emphasis added).  I agree that the exception does not call for \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a categorization that almost always proves fatal to the law in question.  After all, the exception does not restrict the content of the unions\xe2\x80\x99 speech, impose a prior restraint on that speech, or ban union speech on political issues altogether. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But I disagree with the Court in that I believe there is a First Amendment interest at stake.  The exception affects speech, albeit indirectly, by restricting a channel through which speech-supporting finance might flow.  As a result, the alternative to \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d is not necessarily a form of \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d review\xe2\x80\x94a test that almost every restriction will pass.  And instead of applying either \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crational basis\xe2\x80\x9d review to the statutory exception, I would ask the question that this Court has asked in other speech-related contexts, namely whether the statute imposes a burden upon speech that is disproportionate in light of the other interests the government seeks to achieve.  See <em>Burdick </em>v.<em> Takushi</em>, 504 U.S. 428, 433\xe2\x80\x93434 (1992) (election regulation); <em>Nixon </em>v.<em> Shrink Missouri Government PAC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/377/index.html">528 U. S. 377</a>, 403 (2000) (Breyer, J., concurring) (collecting cases); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Thompson </em>v.<em> Western States Medical Center</em>, 535 U.S. 357, 388 (2002) (Breyer, J., dissenting) (discussing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s application of this approach in the commercial speech context); <em>Denver Area Ed. Telecommunications Consortium, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/727/index.html">518 U. S. 727</a>, 740\xe2\x80\x93747 (1996) (plurality opinion) (cable programming regulation); <em>Pickering</em> v. <em>Board of Ed. of Township High School Dist. 205, Will Cty</em>., <a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/index.html">391 U. S. 563</a>, 568 (1968) (government employee speech).  Constitutional courts in other nations also have used similar approaches when facing somewhat similar problems.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Libman </em>v.<em> Quebec</em> (Attorney General), [1997] 3 S. C. R. 569 (Canada) (applying proportionality in the campaign finance context);<em> Bowman </em>v.<em> United Kingdom</em>, 26 European Ct. of Human Rights 1 (1998) (same); <em>Midi Television (Pty) Ltd </em>v. <em>Director of Public Prosecutions</em> [2007] SCA 56 (RSA) (South Africa) (applying proportionality in the freedom of press context); <em>Bakri</em> v. <em>Israel Film Council</em>, HCJ 316/303 (Israel 2003) (applying proportionality in the freedom of expression context).</p>\n<p>\n<em> </em>In these cases the Court has sought to determine whether the harm to speech-related interests is disproportionate in light of the degree of harm, justifications, and potential<em> </em>alternatives.  In doing so, it has considered the seriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the importance of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s countervailing objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other less restrictive ways of doing so.  In light of these considerations, it has determined whether ultimately the statute works speech-related harm that is out of proportion to its justifications.  See <em>Board of Trustees of State Univ. of N. Y.</em> v. <em>Fox</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/492/469/index.html">492 U. S. 469</a>, 480 (1989) (describing need for a \xe2\x80\x9cfit\xe2\x80\x9d between legislative ends and means \xe2\x80\x9cwhose scope is \xe2\x80\x98in proportion to the interest served\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>American Library Assn., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/194/index.html">539 U. S. 194</a>, 217\xe2\x80\x93218 (2003) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).  </p>\n<p>\n\n      Where context calls for \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d one would not  necessarily ask these proportionality questions; but I would ask them in other contexts calling for less than ordinary legislative leeway in light of the fact that constitutionally protected expression is at issue.  See <em>id.,</em> at 218.  To do so, in my view, helps structure what the Court sometimes calls an \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  See <em>Turner Broadcasting System, Inc.</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/622/index.html">512 U. S. 622</a> (1994).</p>\n<p>\n\n     Applying this analysis here, I would find the statutory exception constitutional, but only if I were convinced that the exception applied even handedly among similar politically related contributions.  If so, the provision would still negatively affect speech-related interests, for it would close off one channel through which individuals might provide speech-enabling funds to political institutions.  But, as the majority points out, many other channels for those funds exist, and the State has a strong interest in \xe2\x80\x9cavoiding the reality or appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with partisan politics,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6.  I would consequently find the restriction justified as proportionately serving a legitimate, important governmental need.  Cf. <em>Fox</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 480.</p>\n<p>\n\n     It is not clear, however, whether the particular exception before us does, in fact, operate even handedly.  To read the statute without more, I concede, suggests even handedness.  The provision says that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eductions for political activities <em>as defined in chapter 26, title 44</em>, Idaho Code, shall not be deducted from wages, earnings or compensation of an employee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Idaho Code Ann. \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(2) (Michie 2003) (emphasis added).  And chapter 26, title 44, Idaho Code, defines \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical activities\xe2\x80\x9d without special reference to labor organizations.  See \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932602(e).  </p>\n<p>\n\n    Nonetheless, certain features of the provision suggest it may affect some politically-related deductions, namely labor-related deductions, but not others.  Title 44 of the Idaho Code\xe2\x80\x94entitled \xe2\x80\x9cLabor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is about <em>labor </em>activities.  And the ban on payroll deductions for political activities was enacted as part of a statute in which <em>every other </em>provision is concerned solely with union activities.  See Voluntary Contributions Act, 2003 Idaho Sess. Laws chs. 97 and 340 (codified at Idaho Code Ann. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932601 through 44\xe2\x80\x932605 and \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004).  At the same time, the provision containing the payroll deduction ban is immediately followed by another related provision that expressly mentions labor unions.  See \xc2\xa744\xe2\x80\x932004(3) (\xe2\x80\x9cNothing in this chapter shall prohibit an employee from personally paying contributions for political activities . . . to a <em>labor organization</em> unless such payment is prohibited by law\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to know whether the exception concerns only labor-related political deductions (while allowing other similar deductions) or treats all alike.  A restriction that applies to the political activities of unions alone would seem unlikely to further the government\xe2\x80\x99s justifying objective, namely providing the appearance of political neutrality.  And in that case, the provision could well bring about speech-related harm that is disproportionate to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to further the government\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cneutrality\xe2\x80\x9d objective.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the Court of Appeals analyzed the issue as if the State \xe2\x80\x9cregulated\xe2\x80\x9d its municipalities (as government might regulate a private firm), it did not resolve the questions I have just described.  I would remand the case so that it can decide whether the parties appropriately raised those matters and, if so, consider them.  Accordingly, I would vacate the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision and remand the case.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
