In 2004, she learned of a link between MS and the Hepatitis-B vaccine, and in 2005, she filed a claim for compensation under the NCVIA, alleging that the vaccine caused or exacerbated her MS.  After reviewing the petition and its supporting documentation, the Chief Special Master concluded that Cloer\xe2\x80\x99s claim was untimely because the Act\xe2\x80\x99s 36-month limitations period began to run when she had her first MS symptoms in 1997.  The Federal Circuit ultimately agreed that Cloer\xe2\x80\x99s petition was untimely.  Cloer then sought attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs (collectively, fees).  The en banc Federal Circuit found that she was entitled to recover fees on her untimely petition.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0An untimely NCVIA petition may qualify for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees if it is filed in good faith and there is a reasonable basis for its claim.

Burton, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 84\n.  Nothing in either the NCVIA\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision, which ties eligibility to \xe2\x80\x9cany proceeding on such petition\xe2\x80\x9d and refers specifically to \xe2\x80\x9ca petition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311,\xe2\x80\x9d or the referenced \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311 suggests that the reason for the subsequent dismissal of a petition, such as its untimeliness, nullifies the initial filing.  As the term \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d is commonly understood, an application is filed \xe2\x80\x9cwhen it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Artuz v. Bennett, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 4\n.  Applying this ordinary meaning to the text at issue, it is clear that an NCVIA petition delivered to the court clerk, forwarded for processing, and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a \xe2\x80\x9cpetition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311.\xe2\x80\x9d  So long as it was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.  Had Congress intended otherwise, it could have easily limited fee awards to timely petitions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the 36-month limitations period is a statutory prerequisite for filing lacks textual support.  First, there is no cross-reference to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision in its fees provision, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e), or the referenced \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(1).  Second, reading the provision to provide that \xe2\x80\x9cno petition may be filed for compensation\xe2\x80\x9d late, as the Government asks, would require the Court to conclude that a petition like Cloer\xe2\x80\x99s, which was \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d under that term\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary meaning but was later found to be untimely, was never filed at all.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry ceases [where, as here,] \xe2\x80\x98the statutory language is unambiguous and \xe2\x80\x9cthe statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnhart v.

First, the canon of construction favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity, the presumption favoring the retention of familiar common-law principles, and the policy argument that the NCVIA should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly fees litigation must all give way when, as here, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9care unambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Connecticut Nat.

Second, even if the NCVIA\xe2\x80\x99s plain text requires that special masters occasionally carry out \xe2\x80\x9cshadow trials\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether late petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, that is not such an absurd burden as to require departure from the words of the Act.  This is especially true where Congress has specifically provided for such \xe2\x80\x9cshadow trials\xe2\x80\x9d by permitting the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cin any proceeding [on an unsuccessful] petition\xe2\x80\x9d if such petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.  \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1).

The Act\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision ties eligibility for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees broadly to \xe2\x80\x9cany proceeding on such petition,\xe2\x80\x9d referring specifically to \xe2\x80\x9ca petition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311.\xe2\x80\x9d 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1), (3).

We have explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n application is \xe2\x80\x98filed,\xe2\x80\x99 as that term is commonly understood, when it is delivered to, and accepted by, the appropriate court officer for placement into the official record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Artuz v. Bennett, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 4, \n8 (2000)\n.  When this ordinary meaning is applied to the text of the statute, it is clear that an NCVIA petition which is delivered to the clerk of the court, forwarded for processing, and adjudicated in a proceeding before a special master is a \xe2\x80\x9cpetition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1).  And so long as such a petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, it is eligible for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees, even if it is ultimately unsuccessful.  Ibid.  If Congress had intended to limit fee awards to timely petitions, it could easily have done so.  But the NCVIA instead authorizes courts to award attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for those unsuccessful petitions \xe2\x80\x9cbrought in good faith and [for which] there was a reasonable basis.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government argues that the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision, which states that \xe2\x80\x9cno petition may be filed for compensation\xe2\x80\x9d 36 months after a claimant\xe2\x80\x99s initial symptoms began, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9316(a)(2), constitutes \xe2\x80\x9ca statutory prerequisite to the filing of a petition \xe2\x80\x98for compensation under the Program,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 16.  Thus, the Government contends, a petition that fails to comply with these time limits is not \xe2\x80\x9ca petition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311\xe2\x80\x9d and is therefore ineligible for fees under \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1).  See 675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1364\xe2\x80\x931366 (Bryson, J., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s argument lacks textual support.  First, as noted, there is no cross-reference to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision in its fees provision, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e), or the other section it references, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(1).  When these two linked sections are read in tandem they simply indicate that petitions filed with the clerk of the court are eligible for attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees so long as they comply with the other requirements of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s fees provision.  By its terms, the NCVIA requires nothing more for the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  A petition filed in violation of the limitations period will not result in the payment of compensation, of course, but it is still a petition filed under \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(1).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhen the Act does require compliance with the limitations period, it provides so expressly.  For example, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(2)(A) prevents claimants from bringing suit against vaccine manufacturers \xe2\x80\x9cunless a petition has been filed, in accordance with section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9316 of this title [the limitations provision], for compensation under the Program for such injury or death.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  We have long held that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bates v. United States, \n\n522 U.\xc2\xa0S. 23\n\xe2\x80\x9330 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  The absence of any cross-reference to the limitations provision in either the fees provision, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1), or the instructions for initiating a compensation proceeding, \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(1), indicates that a petition can be \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d without being \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with [the limitations provision].\xe2\x80\x9d  Tellingly, nothing in \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9311(a)(1) requires a petitioner to allege or demonstrate the timeliness of his or her petition to initiate such a proceeding.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, to adopt the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position, we would have to conclude that a petition like Dr. Cloer\xe2\x80\x99s, which was \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d under the ordinary meaning of that term but was later found to be untimely, was never filed at all because, on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading, \xe2\x80\x9cno petition may be filed for compensation\xe2\x80\x9d late.  \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9316(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Yet the court below identified numerous instances throughout the NCVIA where the word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d is given its ordinary meaning, 675 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1361, and the Government does not challenge this aspect of its decision.  Indeed, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading would produce anomalous results with respect to these other NCVIA provisions.  Consider \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9312(b)(2), which provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ithin 30 days after the Secretary receives service of any petition filed under section 300aa\xe2\x80\x9311 of this title the Secretary shall publish notice of such petition in the Federal Register.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the NCVIA\xe2\x80\x99s limitations provision worked to void the filing of an untimely petition, then one would expect the Secretary to make timeliness determinations prior to publishing such notice or to strike any petitions found to be untimely from the Federal Register.  But there is no indication that the Secretary does either of these things.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government asks us to adopt a different definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d for a single subsection so that for fees purposes, and only for fees purposes, a petition filed out of time must be treated retroactively as though it was never filed in the first place.  Nothing in the text or structure of the statute requires the unusual result the Government asks us to accept.  In the NCVIA, the word \xe2\x80\x9cfiled\xe2\x80\x9d carries its common meaning.  See Artuz, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 8.  That \xe2\x80\x9cno petition may be filed for compensation\xe2\x80\x9d after the limitations period has run does not mean that a late petition was never filed at all.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur \xe2\x80\x9cinquiry ceases [in a statutory construction case] if the statutory language is unambiguous and the statutory scheme is coherent and consistent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438, \n450 (2002)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  The text of the statute is clear: like any other unsuccessful petition, an untimely petition brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis that is filed with\xe2\x80\x94meaning delivered to and received by\xe2\x80\x94the clerk of the Court of Federal Claims is eligible for an award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s position is also inconsistent with the goals of the fees provision itself.  A stated purpose of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s fees scheme was to avoid \xe2\x80\x9climit[ing] petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 ability to obtain qualified assistance\xe2\x80\x9d by making fees awards available for \xe2\x80\x9cnon-prevailing, good-faith claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0R.

The Government does not explain why Congress would have intended to discourage counsel from representing petitioners who, because of the difficulty of distinguishing between the initial symptoms of a vaccine-related injury and an unrelated malady, see, e.g., Smith v. Secretary of Dept. of Health and Human Servs., No. 02\xe2\x80\x9393V, 2006 WL 5610517, *6\xe2\x80\x93*7 (Fed.

It first invokes two canons of construction: the canon favoring strict construction of waivers of sovereign immunity and the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98presumption favoring the retention of long-established and familiar [common-law] principles.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 32 (quoting United States v. Texas, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 529, \n534 (1993)\n). Similarly, the Government also argues that the NCVIA should be construed so as to minimize complex and costly fees litigation.  But as the Government acknowledges, such canons and policy arguments come into play only \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o the extent that the Vaccine Act is ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 28.  These \xe2\x80\x9crules of thumb\xe2\x80\x9d give way when \xe2\x80\x9cthe words of a statute are unambiguous,\xe2\x80\x9d as they are here.  Connecticut Nat. Bank v. Germain, \n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 249\n\xe2\x80\x93254 (1992).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, the Government argues that permitting the recovery of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees for untimely petitions will force special masters to carry out costly and wasteful \xe2\x80\x9cshadow trials,\xe2\x80\x9d with no benefit to claimants, in order to determine whether these late petitions were brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis.  We reiterate that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen [a] statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain, the sole function of the courts\xe2\x80\x94at least where the disposition required by the text is not absurd\xe2\x80\x94is to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hartford Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Union Planters Bank, N.\xc2\xa0A., \n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n6 (2000)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  Consequently, even if the plain text of the NCVIA requires that special masters occasionally carry out such \xe2\x80\x9cshadow trials,\xe2\x80\x9d that is not such an absurd burden as to require departure from the words of the Act.  This is particularly true here because Congress has specifically provided for such \xe2\x80\x9cshadow trials\xe2\x80\x9d by permitting the award of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees \xe2\x80\x9cin any proceeding [on an unsuccessful] petition\xe2\x80\x9d if such petition was brought in good faith and with a reasonable basis, \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300aa\xe2\x80\x9315(e)(1) (emphasis added), irrespective of the reasons for the petition\xe2\x80\x99s failure, see, e.g., Caves v.

Cl., Dec. 20, 2012) (opinion of Moran, Special Master) (awarding attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees despite petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to prove causation).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s fears appear to us exaggerated.

In this case, for example, the Chief Special Master conducted a \xe2\x80\x9creview of the record as a whole,\xe2\x80\x9d including the medical evidence that would have supported the merits of Dr. Cloer\xe2\x80\x99s claim, before determining that her petition was untimely.

But the Government offers no evidence to support its speculation.  Additionally, this argument is premised on the assumption that in the pursuit of fees, attorneys will choose to bring claims lacking good faith or a reasonable basis in derogation of their ethical duties.  There is no basis for such an assumption.  Finally, the special masters have shown themselves more than capable of discerning untimely claims supported by good faith and a reasonable basis from those that are specious.
