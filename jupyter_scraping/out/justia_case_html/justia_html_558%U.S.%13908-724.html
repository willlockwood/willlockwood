S. 367</a>, and (2) his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate closing argument deprived him of effective assistance of counsel, see <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>.  The District Court denied the petition, but the Sixth Circuit accepted both arguments and ordered relief.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Because the state court\xe2\x80\x99s upholding of the mitigation jury instructions and forms was not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or \xe2\x80\xa6 an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by [this] Court,\xe2\x80\x9d 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1), the Sixth Circuit was barred from reaching a contrary decision.  The Court of Appeals erred in holding that the instructions and forms contravened Mills</em>, in which this Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue violated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist, 486 U. S., at 380\xe2\x80\x93381, 384.  Even assuming that <em>Mills </em>sets forth the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d for reviewing the state-court decision in this case, the instructions and forms used here differ significantly from those in <em>Mills: </em>They made clear that, to recommend a death sentence, the jury had to find unanimously that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances, but they did not say that the jury had to determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.  Nor did they say anything about how\xe2\x80\x94or even whether\xe2\x80\x94the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.  They focused only on the overall question of balancing the aggravating and mitigating factors, and they repeatedly told the jury to consider all relevant evidence.  Thus, the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly<em> </em>bring about, either through what they said or what they implied, the constitutional error in the <em>Mills </em>instructions.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Similarly, the state-court decision rejecting Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim was not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or \xe2\x80\xa6 an unreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of the law \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Strickland.  </em>\xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  To prevail on this claim, Spisak must show, <em>inter alia,</em> that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 694.  Even assuming that the closing argument was inadequate in the respects claimed by Spisak, this Court finds no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference.  Any different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context: Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s defense at the trial\xe2\x80\x99s guilt phase consisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.  Counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand, where he freely admitted committing three murders and two other shootings and repeatedly expressed an intention to commit further murders if given the opportunity.  In light of this background and for the following reasons, the assumed closing argument deficiencies do not raise the requisite reasonable probability of a different result but for the deficient closing.  First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately after the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds the government\xe2\x80\x99s extensive and graphic evidence regarding the killings, Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s boastful and unrepentant confessions, and his threats to commit further violent acts.  Second, although counsel did not summarize the mitigating evidence in great detail, he did refer to it, and the defense experts\xe2\x80\x99 more detailed testimony regarding Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness was also fresh in the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 minds.  Third, Spisak does not describe what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned; all those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the \xe2\x80\x9cmental defect\xe2\x80\x9d factor that the defense experts described.  Finally, in light of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s several appeals to the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 sense of humanity, it is unlikely that a more explicit or elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result, either alone or together with the foregoing circumstances.  The Court need not reach Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) does not apply to his claim, because it would reach the same conclusion even on <em>de novo </em>review.

Spisak, Jr., the respondent, was convicted in an Ohio trial court of three murders and two attempted murders.  He was sentenced to death.  He filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, claiming that constitutional errors occurred at his trial.  First, Spisak claimed that the jury instructions at the penalty phase unconstitutionally required the jury to consider in mitigation <em>only </em>those<em> </em>factors that the jury <em>unanimously</em> found to be mitigating.  See <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/367/index.html">486 U. S. 367</a> (1988).  Second, Spisak claimed that he suffered significant harm as a result of his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s inadequate closing argument at the penalty phase of the proceeding. See <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  The Federal Court of Appeals accepted these arguments and ordered habeas relief.  We now reverse the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1983, an Ohio jury convicted Spisak of three murders and two attempted murders at Cleveland State University in 1982.  The jury recommended, and the judge imposed, a death sentence.  The Ohio courts denied Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s claims, both on direct appeal and on collateral review.  <em>State</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 800 (1988) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>State</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, No. 67229, 1995 WL 229108 (Ohio App., 8th Dist., Cuyahoga Cty., Apr. 13, 1995); <em>State</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, 73 Ohio St. 3d 151, 652 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 719 (1995) <em>(per curiam)</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak then sought a federal writ of habeas corpus. Among other claims, he argued that the sentencing phase of his trial violated the U. S. Constitution for the two reasons we consider here.  The District Court denied his petition.  <em>Spisak</em> v. <em>Coyle</em>, Case No. 1:95CV2675 (ND Ohio, Apr. 18, 2003), App. to Pet. for Cert. 95a.  But the Court of Appeals accepted Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s two claims, namely, his mitigation instruction claim and his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  <em>Spisak</em> v. <em>Mitchell</em>, 465 F.\xc2\xa03d 684, 703\xe2\x80\x93706, 708\xe2\x80\x93711 (CA6 2006).  The Court of Appeals consequently ordered the District Court to issue a conditional writ of habeas corpus forbidding Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s execution.  <em>Id</em>.<em>,</em> at 715\xe2\x80\x93716.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State of Ohio then sought certiorari in this Court.  We granted the petition and vacated the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment.  <em>Hudson</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/945/index.html">552 U. S. 945</a> (2007).  We remanded the case for further consideration in light of two recent cases in which this Court had held that lower federal courts had not properly taken account of the deference federal law grants state-court determinations on federal habeas review.  <em>Ibid.;</em> see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d); <em>Carey</em> v. <em>Musladin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/70/index.html">549 U.

On remand, the Sixth Circuit reinstated its earlier opinion.  <em>Spisak</em> v. <em>Hudson</em>, 512 F.\xc2\xa03d 852, 853\xe2\x80\x93854 (2008).  The State again sought certiorari.  We again granted the petition.  And we now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s first claim concerns the instructions and verdict forms that the jury received at the sentencing phase of his trial.  The Court of Appeals held the sentencing instructions unconstitutional because, in its view, the instructions, taken together with the forms, \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d]\xe2\x80\x9d juror \xe2\x80\x9cunanimity as to the presence of a mitigating factor\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94contrary to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <em>supra.</em>  465 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 708.  Since the parties do not dispute that the Ohio courts \xe2\x80\x9cadjudicated\xe2\x80\x9d this claim, <em>i.e.</em>, they considered and rejected it \xe2\x80\x9con the merits,\xe2\x80\x9d the law permits a federal court to reach a contrary decision only if the state-court decision \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  Unlike the Court of Appeals, we conclude that Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s claim does not satisfy this standard.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties, like the Court of Appeals, assume that <em>Mills </em>sets forth the pertinent \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  While recognizing some uncertainty as to whether <em>Mills </em>was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly <em>established </em>Federal law\xe2\x80\x9d for the purpose of reviewing the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, we shall assume the same.  Compare <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Taylor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/362/index.html">529 U. S. 362</a>, 390 (2000) (Stevens, J., for the Court) (applicable date for purposes of determining whether \xe2\x80\x9cFederal law\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cestablished\xe2\x80\x9d is when the \xe2\x80\x9cstate-court conviction became final\xe2\x80\x9d), with <em>id.,</em> at 412 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., for the Court) (applicable date is \xe2\x80\x9cthe time of the relevant state-court decision\xe2\x80\x9d); see <em>State</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, 36 Ohio St. 3d 80, 521 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 800 (decided Apr. 13, 1988), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/1071/index.html">489 U. S. 1071</a> (decided Mar. 6, 1989); <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <em>supra</em> (decided June 6, 1988).</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rule the Court set forth in <em>Mills </em>is based on two well-established principles.  First, the Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty if the sentencing judge or jury is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cprecluded from considering, <em>as a mitigating factor, </em>any aspect of a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s character or record and any of the circumstances of the offense that the defendant proffers as a basis for a sentence less than death.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  486 U. S., at 374 (quoting <em>Eddings</em> v. <em>Oklahoma</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/455/104/index.html">455 U. S. 104</a>, 110 (1982), in turn quoting <em>Lockett</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/586/index.html">438 U. S. 586</a>, 604 (1978) (plurality opinion)).  Second, the sentencing judge or jury \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0may not refuse to consider <em>or be precluded from considering</em> \xe2\x80\x9cany relevant mitigating evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Mills</em>, 486 U. S., at 374\xe2\x80\x93375 (quoting <em>Skipper</em> v. <em>South Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/1/index.html">476 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1986), in turn quoting <em>Eddings</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 114).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying these principles, the Court held that the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in the case violated the Constitution because, read naturally, they told the jury that it could not find a particular circumstance to be mitigating unless all 12 jurors agreed that the mitigating circumstance had been proved to exist.  <em>Mills</em>, 486 U. S., at 380\xe2\x80\x93381, 384.  If, for example, the defense presents evidence of three potentially mitigating considerations, some jurors may believe that only the first is mitigating, some only the second, and some only the third.  But if even <em>one</em> of the jurors believes that one of the three mitigating considerations exists, but that he is barred from considering it because the other jurors disagree, the Court held, the Constitution forbids imposition of the death penalty.  See <em>id.,</em> at 380, 384; see also <em>McKoy</em> v. <em>North Carolina</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/433/index.html">494 U. S. 433</a>, 442\xe2\x80\x93443 (1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Mills </em>requires that each juror be permitted to consider and give effect to \xe2\x80\xa6 all mitigating evidence in deciding \xe2\x80\xa6 whether aggravating circumstances outweigh mitigating circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the instructions in <em>Mills</em> would have led a reasonable juror to believe the contrary, the Court held that the sentencing proceeding violated the Constitution.  486 U. S., at 374\xe2\x80\x93375.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In evaluating the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determination here, we have examined the jury instructions and verdict forms at issue in <em>Mills </em>and compared them with those used in the present case.  In the <em>Mills</em> sentencing phase<em>, </em>the trial judge instructed the jury to fill out a verdict form that had three distinct parts.  Section I set forth a list of 10 specific aggravating circumstances next to which were spaces where the jury was to mark \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  Just above the list, the form said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cBased upon the evidence we <em>unanimously </em>find that each of the following aggravating circumstances which is marked \xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99 has been proven \xe2\x80\xa6 and each aggravating circumstance which is marked \xe2\x80\x98no\xe2\x80\x99 has not been proven \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  486 U.

He told the jury that it should mark \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98yes\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d on the jury form if it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unanimously\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d concluded that an aggravating circumstance had been proved.  <em>Id.,</em> at 378.  Otherwise, he said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98of course you must answer no.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis deleted).  These instructions, together with the forms, told the jury to mark \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d on Section II\xe2\x80\x99s list of mitigating factors only if the jury unanimously<em> </em>concluded that the particular mitigating factor had been proved, and to consider in its weighing analysis in Section III only those mitigating factors marked \xe2\x80\x9cyes\xe2\x80\x9d in Section II.  Thus, as this Court found, the jury was instructed that it could consider in the ultimate weighing of the aggravating and mitigating evidence only the mitigating factors that the jury had <em>unanimously </em>found to exist.  See <em>id.,</em> at 380\xe2\x80\x93381.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instructions and jury forms in this case differ significantly from those in <em>Mills.  </em>The trial judge instructed the jury that the aggravating factors they would consider were the specifications that the jury had found proved beyond a reasonable doubt at the guilt phase of the trial\xe2\x80\x94essentially, that each murder was committed in a course of conduct including the other crimes, and, for two of the murders, that the murder was committed with the intent to evade apprehension or punishment for another offense.  8 Tr. 2967\xe2\x80\x932972 (July 19, 1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He then explained the concept of a \xe2\x80\x9cmitigating factor.\xe2\x80\x9d After doing so, he listed examples, including that \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant because of a mental disease or defect \xe2\x80\xa6 lacked substantial capacity to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 2972\xe2\x80\x932973.  The court also told the jury that it could take account of \xe2\x80\x9cany other\xe2\x80\x9d mitigating consideration it found \xe2\x80\x9crelevant to the issue of whether the defendant should be sentenced to death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2973.  And he instructed the jury that the State bore the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances outweighed the mitigating factors.  <em>Id.</em>, at 2965.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect to \xe2\x80\x9cthe procedure\xe2\x80\x9d by which the jury should reach its verdict, the judge told the jury only the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou, the trial jury, must consider all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and testimony received in this hearing and the arguments of counsel.  From this you must determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the aggravating circumstances, which [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts are sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf all twelve members of the jury find by proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance in each separate count outweighs the mitigating factors, then you must return that finding to the Court.</p>\n<p align="left">.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cOn the other hand, if after considering all of the relevant evidence raised at trial, the evidence and the testimony received at this hearing and the arguments of counsel, you find that the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstances which [Spisak] has been found guilty of committing in the separate counts outweigh the mitigating factors, you will then proceed to determine which of two possible life imprisonment sentences to recommend to the Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2973\xe2\x80\x932975.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judge gave the jury two verdict forms for each aggravating factor.  The first of the two forms said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We the jury in this case \xe2\x80\xa6 do find beyond a reasonable doubt that the aggravating circumstance \xe2\x80\xa6 was sufficient to outweigh the mitigating factors present in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We the jury recommend that the sentence of death be imposed \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2975\xe2\x80\x932976.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe other verdict form read:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We the jury \xe2\x80\xa6 do find that the aggravating circumstances \xe2\x80\xa6 are not sufficient to outweigh the mitigation factors present in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98We the jury recommend that the defendant \xe2\x80\xa6 be sentenced to life imprisonment \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2976.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instructions and forms made clear that, to recommend a death sentence, the jury had to find, unanimously and beyond a reasonable doubt, that each of the aggravating factors outweighed any mitigating circumstances.  But the instructions did not say that the jury must determine the existence of each individual mitigating factor unanimously.  Neither the instructions nor the forms said anything about how\xe2\x80\x94or even whether\xe2\x80\x94the jury should make individual determinations that each particular mitigating circumstance existed.  They focused only on the overall balancing question.  And the instructions repeatedly told the jury to \xe2\x80\x9cconside[r] all of the relevant evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2974.  In our view the instructions and verdict forms did not clearly<em> </em>bring about, either through what they said or what they implied, the circumstance that <em>Mills </em>found critical, namely,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ca substantial possibility that reasonable jurors, upon receiving the judge\xe2\x80\x99s instructions in this case, and in attempting to complete the verdict form as instructed, well may have thought they were precluded from considering any mitigating evidence unless all 12 jurors agreed on the existence of a particular such circumstance.\xe2\x80\x9d  486 U. S., at 384.</p>\n<p align="left">\nWe consequently conclude that that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision upholding these forms and instructions was not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or . . . an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Mills.</em>  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We add that the Court of Appeals found the jury instructions unconstitutional for an additional reason, that the instructions \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 709 (citing <em>Maples</em> v. <em>Coyle</em>, 171 F.\xc2\xa03d 408, 416\xe2\x80\x93417 (CA6 1999)).  We have not, however, previously held jury instructions unconstitutional for this reason.  <em>Mills </em>says nothing about the matter.  Neither the parties nor the courts below referred to <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/625/index.html">447 U. S. 625</a> (1980), or identified any other precedent from this Court setting forth this rule.  Cf. <em>Jones</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/373/index.html">527 U. S. 373</a>, 379\xe2\x80\x93384 (1999) (rejecting an arguably analogous claim).  But see <em>post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x935 (Stevens, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).  Whatever the legal merits of the rule or the underlying verdict forms in this case were we to consider them on direct appeal, the jury instructions at Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s trial were not contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established Federal law.\xe2\x80\x9d  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s second claim is that his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument at the sentencing phase of his trial was so inadequate as to violate the Sixth Amendment.  To prevail, Spisak must show both that \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 688, and that there is a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.,</em> at 694.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ohio Supreme Court held that Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s claim was \xe2\x80\x9cnot well-taken on the basis of our review of the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Spisak</em>, 36 Ohio St. 3d, at 82, 521 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 802 (citing, <em>inter alia,</em> <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>).  The District Court concluded that counsel did a constitutionally adequate job and that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]here simply is not a reasonable probability that, absent counsel\xe2\x80\x99s alleged errors, the jury would have concluded that the balance of aggravating and mitigating circumstances did not warrant death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Spisak</em> v. <em>Coyle</em>, App. to Pet. for Cert. 204a.  The Court of Appeals, however, reached a contrary conclusion.  It held that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument, measured by \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was inadequate, and it asserted that \xe2\x80\x9ca \xc2\xa0reasonable probability exists\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that adequate representation would have led to a different result.  465 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 703, 706 (quoting <em>Strickland</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 688).  Responding to the State\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari, we agreed to review the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 terse finding of a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that a more adequate argument would have changed a juror\xe2\x80\x99s vote.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In his closing argument at the penalty phase, Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s counsel described Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s killings in some detail.  He acknowledged that Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s admiration for Hitler inspired his crimes.  He portrayed Spisak as \xe2\x80\x9csick,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ctwisted,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdemented.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 Tr. 2896 (July 19, 1983).  And he said that Spisak was \xe2\x80\x9cnever going to be any different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  He then pointed out that all the experts had testified that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.  And, after a fairly lengthy and rambling disquisition about his own decisions about calling expert witnesses and preparing them, counsel argued that, even if Spisak was not legally insane so as to warrant a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity, he nonetheless was sufficiently mentally ill to lessen his culpability to the point where he should not be executed.  Counsel also told the jury that, when weighing Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s mental illness against the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d aggravating factors present in the case, <em>id.</em>, at 2924, the jurors should draw on their own sense of \xe2\x80\x9cpride\xe2\x80\x9d for living in \xe2\x80\x9ca humane society\xe2\x80\x9d made up of \xe2\x80\x9ca humane people,\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>id.</em>, at 2897\xe2\x80\x932900, 2926\xe2\x80\x932928.  That humanity, he said, required the jury to weigh the evidence \xe2\x80\x9cfairly\xe2\x80\x9d and to be \xe2\x80\x9cloyal to that oath\xe2\x80\x9d the jurors had taken to uphold the law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 2926.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak and his supporting <em>amici </em>say that this argument was constitutionally inadequate because: (1) It overly emphasized the gruesome nature of the killings; (2) it overly emphasized Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s threats to continue his crimes; (3) it understated the facts upon which the experts based their mental illness conclusions; (4) it said little or nothing about any other possible mitigating circumstance; and (5) it made no explicit request that the jury return a verdict against death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 We assume for present purposes that Spisak is correct that the closing argument was inadequate.  We nevertheless find no \xe2\x80\x9creasonable probability\xe2\x80\x9d that a better closing argument without these defects would have made a significant difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Any different, more adequate closing argument would have taken place in the following context: Spisak admitted that he had committed three murders and two other shootings.  Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s defense at the guilt phase of the trial consisted of an effort by counsel to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity.  And counsel, apparently hoping to demonstrate Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s mentally defective condition, called him to the stand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak testified that he had shot and killed Horace Rickerson, Timothy Sheehan, and Brian Warford.  He also admitted that he had shot and tried to kill John Hardaway, and shot at Coletta Dartt.  He committed these crimes, he said, because he was a follower of Adolf Hitler, who was Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cspiritual leader\xe2\x80\x9d in a \xe2\x80\x9cwar\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9csurvival\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cthe Aryan people.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 <em>id.</em>, at 1343\xe2\x80\x931344, 1396 (July 5, 1983).  He said that he had purchased guns and stockpiled ammunition to further this war.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1406\xe2\x80\x931408.  And he had hoped to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate terror\xe2\x80\x9d at Cleveland State University, because it was \xe2\x80\x9cone of the prime targets\xe2\x80\x9d where the \xe2\x80\x9cJews and the system . . . are brainwashing the youth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1426\xe2\x80\x931428.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak then said that in February 1982 he had shot Rickerson, who was black, because Rickerson had made a sexual advance on Spisak in a university bathroom.  He expressed satisfaction at having \xe2\x80\x9celiminated that particular threat . . . to me and to the white race.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 <em>id.</em>, at 1511 (July 7, 1983).  In June he saw a stranger, John Hardaway, on a train platform and shot him seven times because he had been looking for a black person to kill as \xe2\x80\x9cblood atonement\xe2\x80\x9d for a recent crime against two white women.  4 <em>id.</em>, at 1416 (July 5, 1983).  He added that he felt \xe2\x80\x9cgood\xe2\x80\x9d after shooting Hardaway because he had \xe2\x80\x9caccomplished something,\xe2\x80\x9d but later felt \xe2\x80\x9c[k]ind of bad\xe2\x80\x9d when he learned that Hardaway had survived.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1424\xe2\x80\x931425.  In August 1982, Spisak shot at Coletta Dartt because, he said, he heard her \xe2\x80\x9cmaking some derisive remarks about us,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning the Nazi Party.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1432\xe2\x80\x931435.  Later that August, he shot and killed Timothy Sheehan because he \xe2\x80\x9cthought he was one of those Jewish professors . . . that liked to hang around in the men\xe2\x80\x99s room and seduce and pervert and subvert the young people that go there.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 <em>id.</em>, at 1465\xe2\x80\x931466 (July 7, 1983).  Spisak added that he was \xe2\x80\x9csorry about that\xe2\x80\x9d murder because he later learned Sheehan \xe2\x80\x9cwasn\xe2\x80\x99t Jewish like I thought he was.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And three days later, while on a \xe2\x80\x9csearch and destroy mission,\xe2\x80\x9d he shot and killed Brian Warford, a young black man who \xe2\x80\x9clooked like he was almost asleep\xe2\x80\x9d in a bus shelter, to fulfill his \xe2\x80\x9cduty\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cinflict the maximum amount of casualties on the enemies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1454\xe2\x80\x931455, 1478.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak also testified that he would continue to commit similar crimes if he had the chance.  He said about Warford\xe2\x80\x99s murder that he \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t want to get caught that time because I wanted to be able to do it again and again and again and again.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1699 (July 8, 1983).  In a letter written to a friend, he called the murders of Rickerson and Warford \xe2\x80\x9cthe finest thing I ever did in my whole life\xe2\x80\x9d and expressed a wish that he \xe2\x80\x9chad a human submachine gun right now so I could exterminate\xe2\x80\x9d black men \xe2\x80\x9cand watch them scream and twitch in agony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1724\xe2\x80\x931725.  And he testified that, if he still had his guns, he would escape from jail, \xe2\x80\x9cgo out and continue the war I started,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccontinue to inflict the maximum amount of damage on the enemies as I am able to do.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1780\xe2\x80\x931781.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State replied by attempting to show that Spisak was lying in his testimony about the Nazi-related motives for these crimes.  The State contended instead that the shootings were motivated by less unusual purposes, such as robbery.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1680, 1816\xe2\x80\x931818.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defense effort to show that Spisak was not guilty by reason of insanity foundered when the trial judge refused to instruct the jury to consider that question and excluded expert testimony regarding Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s mental state.  The defense\xe2\x80\x99s expert witness, Dr. Oscar Markey, had written a report diagnosing Spisak as suffering from a \xe2\x80\x9cschizotypal personality disorder\xe2\x80\x9d and an \xe2\x80\x9catypical psychotic disorder,\xe2\x80\x9d and as, at times, \xe2\x80\x9cunable to control his impulses to assault.\xe2\x80\x9d  6 <em>id.</em>, at 1882\xe2\x80\x931883, 1992 (July 11, 1983).  His testimony was somewhat more ambiguous during a <em>voir dire</em>, however.  On cross-examination, he conceded that he could not say Spisak failed Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s sanity standard at the time of the murders.  After Markey made the same concession before the jury, the court granted the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s renewed motion to exclude Markey\xe2\x80\x99s testimony and instructed the jury to disregard the testimony that it heard.  And the court excluded the defense\xe2\x80\x99s proffered reports from other psychologists and psychiatrists who examined Spisak, because none of the reports said that Spisak met the Ohio insanity standard at the time of the crimes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1898\xe2\x80\x931899, 1911\xe2\x80\x931912, 1995; <em>id.</em>, at 2017, 2022 (July 12, 1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0During the sentencing phase of the proceedings, defense counsel called three expert witnesses, all of whom testified that Spisak suffered from some degree of mental illness.  Dr. Sandra McPherson, a clinical psychologist, said that Spisak suffered from schizotypal and borderline personality disorders characterized by bizarre and paranoid thinking, gender identification conflict, and emotional instability.  She added that these defects \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially impair his ability to conform himself\xe2\x80\x9d to the law\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  8 <em>id.</em>, at 2428\xe2\x80\x932429, 2430\xe2\x80\x932441 (July 16, 1983).  Dr. Kurt Bertschinger, a psychiatrist, testified that Spisak suffered from a schizotypal personality disorder and that \xe2\x80\x9cmental illness does impair his reason to the extent that he has substantial inability to know wrongfulness, or substantial inability to refrain.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 2552\xe2\x80\x932556.  Dr. Markey, whose testimony had been stricken at the guilt phase, again testified and agreed with the other experts\xe2\x80\x99 diagnoses.  <em>Id.</em>, at 2692\xe2\x80\x932693, 2712\xe2\x80\x932713 (July 18, 1983).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of this background and for the following reasons, we do not find that the assumed deficiencies in defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument raise \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that,\xe2\x80\x9d but for the deficient closing, \xe2\x80\x9cthe result of the proceeding would have been different.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 694.  We therefore cannot find the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision rejecting Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim to be an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable application\xe2\x80\x9d of the law \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Strickland</em>.  \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, since the sentencing phase took place immediately following the conclusion of the guilt phase, the jurors had fresh in their minds the government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence regarding the killings\xe2\x80\x94which included photographs of the dead bodies, images that formed the basis of defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s vivid descriptions of the crimes\xe2\x80\x94as well as Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s boastful and unrepentant confessions and his threats to commit further acts of violence.  We therefore do not see how a less descriptive closing argument with fewer disparaging comments about Spisak could have made a significant difference.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Similarly fresh in the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 minds was the three defense experts\xe2\x80\x99 testimony that Spisak suffered from mental illness.  The jury had heard the experts explain the specific facts upon which they had based their conclusions, as well as what they had learned of his family background and his struggles with gender identity.  And the jury had heard the experts draw connections between his mental illness and the crimes.  We do not see how it could have made a significant difference had counsel gone beyond his actual argument\xe2\x80\x94which emphasized mental illness as a mitigating factor and referred the jury to the experts\xe2\x80\x99 testimony\xe2\x80\x94by repeating the facts or connections that the experts had just described.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does Spisak tell us what other mitigating factors counsel might have mentioned.  All those he proposes essentially consist of aspects of the \xe2\x80\x9cmental defect\xe2\x80\x9d factor that the defense experts described.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, in light of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s several appeals to the jurors\xe2\x80\x99 sense of humanity\xe2\x80\x94he used the words \xe2\x80\x9chumane people\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9chumane society\xe2\x80\x9d 10 times at various points in the argument\xe2\x80\x94we cannot find that a more explicit or more elaborate appeal for mercy could have changed the result, either alone or together with the other circumstances just discussed.  Thus, we conclude that there is not a reasonable probability that a more adequate closing argument would have changed the result, and that the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s claim was not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary to, or \xe2\x80\xa6 an unreasonable application of\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Strickland</em>.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak contends that the deferential standard of review under \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) should not apply to this claim because the Ohio Supreme Court may not have reached the question whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument caused Spisak prejudice.  That is, the Ohio Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s summary rejection of this claim did not indicate whether that court rested its conclusion upon a finding (1) that counsel was not ineffective, or (2) that a better argument would not have made a difference, or (3) both.

First, the jury instructions impermissibly required that the jury unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing options.  Second, the closing argument of Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s counsel was so egregious that it was constitutionally deficient under any standard.  Nevertheless, for the reasons set forth in Part III of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9315, I agree that these errors did not prejudice Spisak and thus he is not entitled to relief.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The jury instructions given during Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase, described in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x938, are fairly read to require the jury first to consider whether the death penalty is warranted\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, whether the aggravating factors outweigh the mitigating factors\xe2\x80\x94before moving on to consider whether instead a lesser penalty\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, one of two available life sentences\xe2\x80\x94is appropriate.  Consistent with Ohio law at the time of Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s trial,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] the jury was told that it must reach its decision unanimously.  The jury was not instructed on the consequence of their failure to agree unanimously that Spisak should be sentenced to death.  Spisak and the Court of Appeals both described these instructions as \xe2\x80\x9cacquittal first\xe2\x80\x9d because they would have led a reasonable jury to believe that it first had to \xe2\x80\x9cacquit\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant of death\xe2\x80\x94unanimously\xe2\x80\x94before it could give effect to a lesser penalty.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Following its prior decision in <em>Davis </em>v. <em>Mitchell</em>, 318 F.\xc2\xa03d 682 (CA6 2003), in which it struck down \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually identical\xe2\x80\x9d jury instructions, <em>Spisak </em>v. <em>Mitchell,</em> 465 F.\xc2\xa03d 684, 710 (CA6 2006), the Court of Appeals concluded that the instructions given during Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase were impermissible because they \xe2\x80\x9crequire[d] the jury to unanimously reject a death sentence before considering other sentencing alternatives,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 709.  In <em>Davis</em>, the court had explained that an instruction that requires a capital jury to \xe2\x80\x9cfirst unanimously reject the death penalty before it can consider a life sentence . . . precludes the individual jury from giving effect to mitigating evidence . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d  318 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 689.  The source of this constitutional infirmity, the court decided, was our decision in <em>Mills</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/486/367/index.html">486 U. S. 367</a> (1988).  For the reasons cogently examined in Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x939, I agree that <em>Mills</em> does not clearly establish that the instructions at issue were unconstitutional.  But, in my view, our decision in <em>Beck</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/625/index.html">447 U. S. 625</a> (1980), does.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Beck</em> we held that the death penalty may not be imposed \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the jury was not permitted to consider a verdict of guilt of a lesser included non-capital offense, and when the evidence would have supported such a verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 627 (internal quotation marks omitted).  At that time, the Alabama death penalty statute had been \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently construed to preclude any lesser included offense instructions in capital cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 629, n.\xc2\xa03.  Thus, the Alabama jury was \xe2\x80\x9cgiven the choice of either convicting the defendant of the capital crime, in which case it [was] required to impose the death penalty, or acquitting him, thus allowing him to escape all penalties for his alleged participation in the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 628\xe2\x80\x93629.  Because of the unique features of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s capital punishment system,[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] Beck\xe2\x80\x99s jury believed that either it had to convict Beck, thus sending him to his death, or acquit him, thus setting him free.  The jury was not presented with the \xe2\x80\x9cthird option\xe2\x80\x9d of convicting him of a noncapital offense, thus ensuring that he would receive a substantial punishment but not receive the death penalty.  <em>Id.</em>, at 642.  We concluded that the false choice before the jury\xe2\x80\x94death or acquit\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cintroduce[d] a level of uncertainty and unreliability into the factfinding process that cannot be tolerated in a capital case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 643.  In other words,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cthe difficulty with the Alabama statute is that it interjects irrelevant considerations into the factfinding process, diverting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s attention from the central issue of whether the State has satisfied its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant is guilty of a capital crime.  Thus, on the one hand, the unavailability of the third option of convicting on a lesser included offense may encourage the jury to convict for an impermissible reason\xe2\x80\x94its belief that the defendant is guilty of some serious crime and should be punished.  On the other hand, the apparently mandatory nature of the death penalty may encourage it to acquit for an equally impermissible reason\xe2\x80\x94that, whatever his crime, the defendant does not deserve death.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 642\xe2\x80\x93643.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Beck</em> dealt with guilt-phase instructions, the reach of its holding is not so limited.  The \xe2\x80\x9cthird option\xe2\x80\x9d we discussed in <em>Beck</em> was, plainly, a life sentence.  Moreover, the unusual features of the Alabama capital sentencing scheme collapsed the guilt and penalty phases before the jury (but not before the judge).  Our concern in <em>Beck</em> was that presenting the jury with only two options\xe2\x80\x94death or no punishment\xe2\x80\x94introduced a risk of arbitrariness and error into the deliberative process that the Constitution could not abide in the capital context.  See <em>Spaziano</em> v. <em>Florida</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/447/index.html">468 U. S. 447</a>, 455 (1984) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe goal of the <em>Beck</em> rule, in other words, is to eliminate the distortion of the factfinding process that is created when the jury is forced into an all-or-nothing choice between capital murder and innocence\xe2\x80\x9d).  We held, therefore, that the jury must be given a meaningful opportunity to consider and embrace the equivalent of a life-sentence when the evidence supports such an option.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The acquittal-first jury instructions used during Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s penalty phase interposed before the jury the same false choice that our holding in <em>Beck </em>prohibits.  By requiring Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s jury to decide first whether the State had met its burden with respect to the death sentence, and to reach that decision unanimously, the instructions deprived the jury of a meaningful opportunity to consider the third option that was before it, namely, a life sentence.  Indeed, these instructions are every bit as pernicious as those at issue in <em>Beck</em> because they would have led individual jurors (falsely) to believe that their failure to agree might have resulted in a new trial and that, in any event, they could not give effect to their determination that a life sentence was appropriate unless and until they had first convinced each of their peers on the jury to reject the death sentence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Admittedly, Spisak has never identified <em>Beck</em> as the source of the constitutional infirmity at issue in this case, nor did the courts below cite or rely upon it.  But Spisak has consistently pressed his argument in terms that are wholly consistent with <em>Beck</em>.  On direct appeal he contended, for example, that he:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cwas severely prejudiced by the erroneous jury forms because the jurors were never informed of what would happen if they were unable to reach a unanimous decision.  That may have led to irreparable speculation that if they failed to agree, Frank Spisak would be freed or have a new trial or sentencing hearing.  Such improper speculation may have led those not in agreement with death to go along with a majority.  The jury should have been instructed that if they were unable to unanimously agree to death they must return a verdict of one of the life sentences or in the alternative, the court would impose a life sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Exh. 28D, 16 Record 391 (Brief for Supreme Court of Ohio).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe untenable choice Spisak describes is perfectly analogous to the quandary, discussed above, that we described in <em>Beck</em>.  See also 447 U. S., at 644 (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is extremely doubtful that juries will understand the full implications of a mistrial or will have any confidence that their choice of the mistrial option will ultimately lead to the right result.  Thus, they could have no assurance that a second trial would end in the conviction of the defendant on a lesser included offense\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  Spisak and the Court of Appeals both correctly assailed the jury instructions at issue in this case, but in my view <em>Beck</em> provides the proper basis in clearly established federal law to conclude the instructions were unconstitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner defends Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument as a reasonable strategic decision \xe2\x80\x9cto draw the sting out of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s argument and gain credibility with the jury by conceding the weaknesses of his own case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 37.  I agree that such a strategy is generally a reasonable one and, indeed, was a reasonable strategy under the difficult circumstances of this case.  Even Spisak concedes that his counsel \xe2\x80\x9cfaced an admittedly difficult case in closing argument in the penalty phase.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 43.  But, surely, a strategy can be executed so poorly as to render even the most reasonable of trial tactics constitutionally deficient under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).  And this is such a case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to convey how thoroughly egregious counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument was without reproducing it in its entirety.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the closing as \xe2\x80\x9clengthy and rambling\xe2\x80\x9d and its brief description of its content, see <em>ante</em>, at 10, does not accurately capture the catastrophe of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failed strategy.  Suffice it to say that the argument shares far more in common with a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s closing than with a criminal defense attorney\xe2\x80\x99s.  Indeed, the argument was so outrageous that it would have rightly subjected a prosecutor to charges of misconduct.  See Brief for Steven Lubet et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (observing that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s closing argument \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been improper even coming from the <em>prosecutor</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  A few examples are in order.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Presumably to take the \xe2\x80\x9csting\xe2\x80\x9d out of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case, Brief for Petitioner 37, counsel described his client\xe2\x80\x99s acts in vivid detail to the jury:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[Y]ou can smell almost the blood.

And there is too much terror left in the hearts of those that we call lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  465 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 704\xe2\x80\x93795 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nPresumably to \xe2\x80\x9cgain credibility\xe2\x80\x9d with the jury, Brief of Petitioner 37, counsel argued that his client deserved no sympathy for his actions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cSympathy, of course, is not part of your consideration.  And even if it was, certainly, don\xe2\x80\x99t look to him for sympathy, because he demands none.  And, ladies and gentlemen, when you turn and look at Frank Spisak, don\xe2\x80\x99t look for good deeds, because he has done none.  Don\xe2\x80\x99t look for good thoughts, because he has none.  He is sick, he is twisted.  He is demented, and he is never going to be any different.\xe2\x80\x9d  465 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 705 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And then the strategy really broke down:  At no point did counsel endeavor to direct his negative statements about his client toward an express appeal for leniency.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  On the contrary, counsel concluded by telling the jury that \xe2\x80\x9cwhatever you do, we are going to be proud of you,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted), which I take to mean that, in counsel\xe2\x80\x99s view, \xe2\x80\x9ceither outcome, death or life, would be a valid conclusion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s crimes, and the seemingly unmitigated hatred motivating their commission, were truly awful.  But that does not excuse a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s duty to represent his client within the bounds of prevailing professional norms.  The mere fact that counsel, laudably, may have had a \xe2\x80\x9cstrategy\xe2\x80\x9d to build rapport with the jury and lessen the impact of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case, does not excuse counsel\xe2\x80\x99s utter failure to achieve either of these objectives through his closing argument.  In short, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s argument grossly transgressed the bounds of what constitutionally competent counsel would have done in a similar situation.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding these two serious constitutional errors, I agree with the Court that these errors do not entitle Spisak to relief.  As Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s discussion in Part III makes vividly clear, see <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9314, Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct alienated and ostracized the jury, and his crimes were monstrous.  In my judgment even the most skillful of closing arguments\xe2\x80\x94even one befitting Clarence Darrow\xe2\x80\x94would not have created a reasonable probability of a different outcome in this case.  Similarly, in light of Spisak\xe2\x80\x99s conduct before the jury and the gravity of the aggravating circumstances of the offense, the instructional error was also harmless because it did not have a substantial and injurious effect on this record, <em>Brecht</em> v. <em>Abrahamson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/index.html">507 U. S. 619</a>, 623 (1993).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I concur in the judgment and concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of prejudice in Part III of its opinion.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Ohio no longer uses the type of jury instructions at issue in this case.  In 1996 the Ohio Supreme Court instructed that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n Ohio, a solitary juror may prevent a death penalty recommendation by finding that the aggravating circumstances in the case do not outweigh the mitigating factors.  Jurors from this point forward should be so instructed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State</em> v. <em>Brooks</em>, 75 Ohio St. 3d 148, 162, 661 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1030, 1042.  Although the <em>Brooks </em>decision signaled a change in Ohio\xe2\x80\x99s capital jury instructions, it was not a change in state law: One juror had the power to prevent a death penalty recommendation before <em>Brooks</em>.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Springer</em>, 63 Ohio St. 3d 167, 172, 586 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 96, 100 (1992) (holding that an offender must be sentenced to life if the penalty-phase jury deadlocks).  Thus, consistent with our view that \xe2\x80\x9caccurate sentencing information is an indispensable prerequisite to a [jury\xe2\x80\x99s] determination of whether a defendant shall live or die,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Gregg</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/153/index.html">428 U.
