Second, the Court of Appeals held that Ford\'s claim that Florida administers the death penalty in a discriminatory manner on the basis of race and other impermissible factors (the "discrimination claim") should be held pending en banc consideration by the Eleventh Circuit of Spencer v.

Zant, supra. The District Court had found that Ford had abused the writ by failing to raise this claim in his first federal habeas petition. The Court of Appeals provides no convincing explanation for ignoring that factual determination. Moreover, the Florida Supreme Court held that Ford\'s discrimination claim was procedurally barred for failure to present it in a motion for postconviction relief as required by Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850. Ford v. Wainwright, 457 So.2d 471. Neither the Court of Appeals nor the District Court found cause and prejudice to excuse this procedural bar. See Engle v. Isaac, <a href="/cases/federal/us/456/107/case.html">456 U.S. 107</a>d 783 (1982). claim") should be held pending en banc consideration by the Eleventh Circuit of Spencer v.

Finally, we have held in two prior cases that the statistical evidence relied upon by Ford to support his claim of discrimination was not sufficient to raise a substantial ground upon which relief might be granted. See Sullivan v. Wainwright, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/109/case.html">464 U.S. 109</a>, 104 S. Ct. 450 (1983); Wainwright v. Adams, 466 U.S. 964, 104 S. Ct. 2183 (1984). I am of the opinion that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion in also granting a stay of execution on Ford\'s discrimination claim pending its decision in Spencer v. Zant, supra. </p><p> Justice STEVENS, having joined in Part I above, is of the view that it is unnecessary to consider the discrimination claim presented in Part II. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> a1. This Court has never determined whether the Constitution prohibits execution of a criminal defendant who currently is insane, and I imply no view as to the merits of this issue. <p> </p><p>\n</p></b></div><b>\n</b></div><b>\n</b></font></b></div>'
