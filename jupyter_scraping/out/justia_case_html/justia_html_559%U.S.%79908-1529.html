Although a U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) physician\xe2\x80\x99s assistant and three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda urgently needed a biopsy, petitioners\xe2\x80\x94a PHS physician and a commissioned PHS officer\xe2\x80\x94denied the request.  After Castaneda was released from custody, tests confirmed that he had metastatic cancer.  He then filed this suit, raising medical negligence claims against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346, 2671\xe2\x80\x932680, and constitutional claims against petitioners under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed.

The District Court denied petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the <em>Bivens </em>action, rejecting their claim of absolute immunity under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7233(a), which provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe [FTCA] remedy <em>against the United States</em> provided by [28 U.

The breadth of \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s words \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d supports this reading, as does the provision\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of \xe2\x80\x9cthe same subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  Because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive of any other civil action\xe2\x80\x9d is easily broad enough to accommodate both known and unknown causes of action, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading is not undermined by the fact that \xc2\xa7233(a) preceded <em>Bivens</em>.  The later enacted Westfall Act further supports this understanding of \xc2\xa7233(a).  In amending the FTCA to make its remedy against the United States exclusive for most claims against Government employees for their official conduct, the Westfall Act essentially duplicated \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s exclusivity language, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7 2679(b)(1), but provided an<em> </em>explicit exception for constitutional violations, \xc2\xa72679(b)(2).  This shows that Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by \xc2\xa72679(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94or the substantially similar \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x94to imply such an exception.

Because \xc2\xa7233(a) refers only to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>remedy </em>\xe2\x80\xa6 provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), only those portions of the FTCA that establish its remedy are incorporated by \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa71346.  Section 2679(b) is not such a provision.

Repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed absent a clear and manifest legislative intent to repeal.  <em>Hawaii</em> v. <em>Office of Hawaiian Affairs</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7233(a), as added, 84 Stat. 1870, precludes an action under <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html"></a><a href="/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971), against U. S. Public Health Service (PHS) personnel for constitutional violations arising out of their official duties.  When federal employees are sued for damages for harms caused in the course of their employment, the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71346, 2671\xe2\x80\x932680, generally authorizes substitution of the United States as the defendant.  Section 233(a) makes the FTCA remedy against the United States \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d for any personal injury caused by a PHS officer or employee performing a medical or related function \xe2\x80\x9cwhile acting within the scope of his office or employment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Based on the plain language of \xc2\xa7233(a), we conclude that PHS officers and employees are not personally subject to <em>Bivens </em>actions for harms arising out of such conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Francisco Castaneda was detained by U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at the San Diego Correctional Facility (SDCF) beginning in March 2006.  According to the complaint later filed in the District Court, when Castaneda arrived at SDCF he had on his penis an irregular, raised lesion that measured roughly two centimeters square.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Castaneda promptly brought his condition to the attention of medical personnel working for the Division of Immigration Health Services, reporting that the lesion was growing in size and becoming more painful and that it frequently bled and emitted a discharge.  Petitioner Dr.<font b="1"> Esther Hui, a civilian PHS employee, was the physician responsible for Castaneda\xe2\x80\x99s medical care during his detention at SDCF.  Petitioner Commander Stephen Gonsalves, a commissioned PHS officer, was a Health Services Administrator at SDCF during the relevant period.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Between March 2006 and January 2007, Castaneda persistently sought treatment for his condition.  As his disease progressed, the lesion became increasingly painful and interfered with his urination, defecation, and sleep.  In December 2006, Castaneda additionally reported a lump in his groin.  A PHS physician\xe2\x80\x99s assistant and three outside specialists repeatedly advised that Castaneda needed a biopsy to ascertain whether he had cancer.  Petitioners denied requests for a biopsy and other recommended procedures as \xe2\x80\x9celective.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 244, 249\xe2\x80\x93251.  Instead, Castaneda was treated with ibuprofen and antibiotics and was given an additional ration of boxer shorts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a fourth specialist recommended a biopsy in January 2007, the procedure was finally authorized.  Instead of providing treatment, however, ICE released Castaneda from custody on February 5.  A week later, biopsy results confirmed that Castaneda was suffering from penile cancer.  The next day, Castaneda had his penis amputated, and he began chemotherapy after tests confirmed that the cancer had metastasized to his groin.  The treatment was unsuccessful, and Castaneda died in February 2008.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Three months before his death, Castaneda filed suit against petitioners in the United States District Court for the Central District of California.  As relevant, Castaneda raised medical negligence claims against the United States under the FTCA and <em>Bivens </em>claims against petitioners for deliberate indifference to his serious medical needs in violation of his Fifth, Eighth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  After Castaneda\xe2\x80\x99s death, respondents\xe2\x80\x94Castaneda\xe2\x80\x99s sister, Yanira Castaneda, and his daughter, Vanessa Castaneda (by and through her mother, Lucia Pelayo)\xe2\x80\x94amended the complaint to substitute themselves as plaintiffs.  Yanira and Vanessa Castaneda are respectively the representative of and heir to Castaneda\xe2\x80\x99s estate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved to dismiss the claims against them, contending that \xc2\xa7233(a) gives them absolute immunity from <em>Bivens </em>actions by making a suit against the United States under the FTCA the exclusive remedy for harms caused by PHS personnel in the course of their medical or related duties.  The District Court denied the motion, concluding that \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text and history evidence a congressional intent to preserve <em>Bivens </em>actions.  <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>United States</em>,<em> </em>538 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1279, 1288\xe2\x80\x931295 (2008).  Petitioners filed an interlocutory appeal.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment that \xc2\xa7233(a) does not preclude respondents\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Bivens </em>claims.  <em>Castaneda </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 546 F.\xc2\xa03d 682 (2008).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The court cited <em>Carlson</em> v. <em>Green</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/446/14/index.html"></a><a href="/us/446/14/index.html">446 U. S. 14</a> (1980), for the proposition that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is unavailable only when an alternative remedy is both expressly declared to be a substitute and can be viewed as equally effective, or when special factors militate against direct recovery.  Looking to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text and history, the court noted that \xc2\xa7233(a) does not mention the Constitution or recovery thereunder and found it significant that \xc2\xa7233 was enacted prior to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Bivens</em>.  Drawing further support for its view from the statute\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history and from subsequent congressional enactments, the Court of Appeals concluded that \xc2\xa7233(a) does not expressly make the remedy under the FTCA a substitute for relief under <em>Bivens</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For essentially the reasons given in <em>Carlson</em>, 446 U. S., at 20\xe2\x80\x9323, the Court of Appeals also determined that the FTCA remedy is not equally effective as a <em>Bivens </em>remedy.  Unlike the remedy under the FTCA, the court reasoned, a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is awarded against individual defendants and may include punitive damages.  Additionally, <em>Bivens </em>cases may be tried before a jury, and liability is governed by uniform federal rules rather than the law of the State in which the violation occurred.  After further concluding that no special factors militate against finding a remedy available in these circumstances, the court held that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Bivens </em>action could proceed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Ninth Circuit recognized, its holding conflicts with the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Cuoco </em>v. <em>Moritsugu</em>, 222 F.\xc2\xa03d 99 (2000), which construed \xc2\xa7233(a) to foreclose <em>Bivens </em>actions against PHS personnel.  We granted certiorari to resolve this conflict.  557 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our inquiry in this case begins and ends with the text of \xc2\xa7233(a).  See <em>Harris Trust and Sav. Bank</em> v. <em>Salomon Smith Barney Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/238/index.html">530 U. S. 238</a>, 254 (2000).  The statute provides in pertinent part that:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[t]he remedy <em>against the United States</em> provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672 of title 28 \xe2\x80\xa6 for damage for personal injury, including death, resulting from the performance of medical, surgical, dental, or related functions, including the conduct of clinical studies or investigation, by any commissioned officer or employee of the Public Health Service while acting within the scope of his office or employment, <em>shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding by reason of the same subject-matter against the officer or employee</em> (or his estate) whose act or omission gave rise to the claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7233(a) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\nSection 233(a) grants absolute immunity to PHS officers and employees for actions arising out of the performance of medical or related functions within the scope of their employment by barring all actions against them for such conduct.  By its terms, \xc2\xa7233(a) limits recovery for such conduct to suits against the United States.  The breadth of the words \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d supports this reading, as does the provision\xe2\x80\x99s inclusive reference to all civil proceedings arising out of \xe2\x80\x9cthe same subject-matter.\xe2\x80\x9d  We have previously cited \xc2\xa7233(a) to support the contention that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress follows the practice of explicitly stating when it means to make FTCA an exclusive remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carlson</em>, 446 U. S., at 20.  The meaning of \xc2\xa7233(a) has become no less explicit since we last made that observation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our reading of \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text is not undermined by the fact that the provision preceded our decision in <em>Bivens</em>.  Contrary to the view of the Court of Appeals, that a <em>Bivens </em>remedy had not yet been recognized when \xc2\xa7233(a) was enacted does not support the conclusion that Congress, in making the remedy provided by the FTCA \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive of any other civil action,\xe2\x80\x9d did not mean what it said.  Language that broad easily accommodates both known and unknown causes of action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The later enacted Federal Employees Liability Reform and Tort Compensation Act of 1988 (Westfall Act), 102 Stat. 4563, further supports this understanding of \xc2\xa7233(a).  The Westfall Act amended the FTCA to make its remedy against the United States the exclusive remedy for most claims against Government employees arising out of their official conduct.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  In providing this official immunity, Congress used essentially the same language as it did in \xc2\xa7233(a), stating that the remedy against the United\xc2\xa0States is \xe2\x80\x9cexclusive of any other civil action or proceeding,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72679(b)(1).  Notably, Congress also provided an<em> </em>exception for constitutional violations.  Pursuant to \xc2\xa72679(b)(2), the immunity granted by \xc2\xa72679(b)(1) \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not extend or apply to a civil action against an employee of the Government \xe2\x80\xa6 brought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A).  The Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s explicit exception for <em>Bivens </em>claims is powerful evidence that Congress did not understand the exclusivity provided by \xc2\xa72679(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x94or the substantially similar \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x94to imply such an exception.  Given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 awareness of pre-existing immunity provisions like \xc2\xa7233 when it enacted the Westfall Act, see <em>United States</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/499/160/index.html"></a><a href="/us/499/160/index.html">499 U. S. 160</a>, 173 (1991), it is telling that Congress declined to enact a similar exception to the immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In advocating a contrary reading of \xc2\xa7233(a), respondents rely heavily on our opinion in <em>Carlson</em>, as did the Court of Appeals.  <em>Carlson</em>, however, is inapposite to the issue in this case.  There are two separate inquiries involved in determining whether a <em>Bivens </em>action may proceed against a federal agent: whether the agent is amenable to suit, and whether a damages remedy is available for a particular constitutional violation absent authorization by Congress.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Stanley</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/669/index.html">483 U. S. 669</a>, 684 (1987) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he availability of a damages action under the Constitution for particular <em>injuries</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 is a question logically distinct from immunity to such an action on the part of particular <em>defendants</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even in circumstances in which a <em>Bivens </em>remedy is generally available, an action under <em>Bivens </em>will be defeated if the defendant is immune from suit.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 403 U. S., at 397\xe2\x80\x93398 (remanding for determination of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 immunity after implying a cause of action under the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because petitioners in <em>Carlson </em>invoked no official immunity, the Court did not address that question.  Instead, it considered whether a remedy was available under the Eighth Amendment for alleged violations of the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause notwithstanding that a federal remedy was also available under the FTCA.  446 U. S., at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  Many of our subsequent <em>Bivens </em>decisions likewise addressed only the existence of an implied cause of action for an alleged constitutional violation.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wilkie</em> v. <em>Robbins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/551/537/index.html">551 U. S. 537</a>, 549 (2007) (declining \xe2\x80\x9cto devise a new <em>Bivens </em>damages action for retaliating against the exercise of ownership rights\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bush</em> v. <em>Lucas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/367/index.html">462 U. S. 367</a>, 368 (1983) (declining to \xe2\x80\x9cauthorize a new nonstatutory damages remedy for federal employees whose First Amendment rights are violated by their superiors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case presents the separate question whether petitioners are immune from suit for the alleged violations.  To determine a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s amenability to suit, we consider whether he or she may claim the benefits of official immunity for the alleged misconduct.  Because petitioners invoke only the immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a), the question in this case is answered solely by reference to whether that provision gives petitioners the immunity they claim.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As noted, the text of \xc2\xa7233(a) plainly indicates that it precludes a <em>Bivens </em>action against petitioners for the harm alleged in this case.  Respondents offer three arguments in support of their claim that it does not.  None persuades us that \xc2\xa7233(a) means something other than what it says.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents first contend that \xc2\xa7233(a) incorporates the entirety of the FTCA, as amended by the Westfall Act, through its reference to \xc2\xa71346(b).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Section 1346(b) in turn refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe provisions of chapter 171,\xe2\x80\x9d which constitute the FTCA, including the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s exception for claims \xe2\x80\x9cbrought for a violation of the Constitution of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A).  Through this series of cross-references, respondents would read that exception for <em>Bivens </em>actions into \xc2\xa7233(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 233(a) is not susceptible of this reading.  As petitioners observe, that provision refers only to \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he <em>remedy </em>against the United States provided by sections 1346(b) and 2672.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7233(a) (emphasis added).  Thus, only those portions of chapter 171 that establish the FTCA remedy are incorporated by \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa71346.  Section 2679(b) is not such a provision.  Section 233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa72672[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]\xe2\x80\x94which is codified in chapter 171\xe2\x80\x94also belies respondents\xe2\x80\x99 theory.  If \xc2\xa7233(a)\xe2\x80\x99s reference to \xc2\xa71346(b) served to incorporate all the provisions of chapter 171, the separate reference to \xc2\xa72672 would be superfluous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents next argue that the Westfall Act\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Bivens </em>exception, \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A), directly preserves a <em>Bivens </em>action against PHS officers and employees.  That \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A) by its terms applies only to the specific immunity set forth in \xe2\x80\x9c[p]aragraph (1)\xe2\x80\x9d belies respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim.  Moreover, if \xc2\xa7233(a) forecloses a <em>Bivens </em>action against PHS personnel, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A) would effect an implied repeal of that more specific provision.  Although we noted in <em>Smith </em>that \xc2\xa72679(b) applies to all federal employees, see 499 U. S., at 173, we had no occasion to consider whether the <em>Bivens </em>exception in \xc2\xa72679(b)(2)(A) impliedly repealed pre-existing immunity provisions to the extent of any inconsistency.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs we have emphasized, repeals by implication are not favored and will not be presumed unless the intention of the legislature to repeal is clear and manifest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hawaii</em> v. <em>Office of Hawaiian Affairs</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2009) (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311) (internal quotation marks and alteration omitted).  Respondents have pointed to nothing in \xc2\xa72679(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text or drafting history that suggests that Congress intended to repeal the more comprehensive immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents contend that other features of \xc2\xa7233 show that subsection (a) does not make the remedy under the FTCA exclusive of all other actions against PHS personnel.  Respondents first note \xc2\xa7233\xe2\x80\x99s lack of a procedure for \xe2\x80\x9cscope certification\xe2\x80\x9d in federal-court actions.  Under the FTCA, \xe2\x80\x9ccertification by the Attorney General that the defendant employee was acting within the scope of his office or employment at the time of the incident out of which the claim arose\xe2\x80\x9d transforms an action against an individual federal employee into one against the United States.  \xc2\xa72679(d)(1).  Because \xc2\xa7233 does not provide a similar mechanism for scope certification in federal-court actions,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] respondents contend that PHS defendants seeking to invoke the immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a) must rely on the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s scope certification procedure, set forth in \xc2\xa72679(d).  Section 2679(d), respondents note, is in turn subject to the \xe2\x80\x9climitations and exceptions\xe2\x80\x9d applicable to actions under the FTCA\xe2\x80\x94including the exception for <em>Bivens </em>actions provided by \xc2\xa72679(b)(2).  See \xc2\xa72679(d)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agree with petitioners that there is no reason to think that scope certification by the Attorney General is a prerequisite to immunity under \xc2\xa7233(a).  To be sure, that immunity is contingent upon the alleged misconduct having occurred in the course of the PHS defendant\xe2\x80\x99s duties, but a defendant may make that proof pursuant to the ordinary rules of evidence and procedure.  As petitioners observe, proof of scope is in most \xc2\xa7233(a) cases established by a declaration affirming that the defendant was a PHS official during the relevant time period.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner Hui 6\xe2\x80\x937, and n.\xc2\xa01.  Thus, while scope certification may provide a convenient mechanism for establishing that the alleged misconduct occurred within the scope of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s duties, the procedure authorized by \xc2\xa72679(d) is not necessary to effect substitution of the United States.  Finally, that the FTCA\xe2\x80\x99s scope certification procedure was enacted almost two decades after \xc2\xa7233(a) confirms that Congress did not intend to make that procedure the exclusive means for PHS personnel to invoke the official immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument based on \xc2\xa7233(f) is similarly unavailing.  That subsection authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \xe2\x80\x9chold harmless or provide liability insurance\xe2\x80\x9d for a PHS officer or employee for personal injuries caused by conduct occurring \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of his office or employment \xe2\x80\xa6 if such employee is assigned to a foreign country \xe2\x80\xa6 and if the circumstances are such as are likely to preclude the remedies of third persons against the United States described in section 2679(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  Noting that the FTCA precludes recovery against the United States for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny claim arising in a foreign country,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72680(k), respondents urge that \xc2\xa7233(f)\xe2\x80\x99s authorization of insurance or indemnification in those circumstances anticipates that an injured party without a remedy under the FTCA may sue a PHS official directly.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Accordingly, respondents contend, \xc2\xa7233(a) cannot be read to make the remedy under the FTCA truly exclusive.  Even if that reading of \xc2\xa7233(f) were correct, it would not benefit respondents because an FTCA remedy is unquestionably available for the misconduct alleged in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments do not undermine our conclusion that the immunity provided by \xc2\xa7233(a) precludes <em>Bivens </em>actions against individual PHS officers or employees for harms arising out of conduct described in that section.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In construing \xc2\xa7233(a) in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 favor, we are mindful of the confines of our judicial role.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 <em>amici </em>caution that providing special immunity for PHS personnel is contrary to the public interest.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Respondents likewise contend that allowing <em>Bivens </em>claims against PHS personnel is necessary to ensure an adequate standard of care in federal detention facilities, and they further urge that permitting such actions would not endanger PHS\xe2\x80\x99 institutional interests as it would simply place PHS personnel in the same position as other federal employees who perform similar functions.  See Brief for Respondents 52\xe2\x80\x9355, 60\xe2\x80\x9361.  We are required, however, to read the statute according to its text.  Because \xc2\xa7233(a) plainly precludes a <em>Bivens </em>action against petitioners for the harms alleged in this case, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Because this case comes to us on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss, we assume the truth of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 factual allegations.
