The appeal is regularly here, an cannot be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  The motion, therefore, must be DENIED.</p>\n<p>Counsel for the appellee has referred us to an order dismissing a writ of error at the last term under circumstances like those of the case before us.  This order must have been entered through inadvertence, and cannot be drawn into a precedent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
