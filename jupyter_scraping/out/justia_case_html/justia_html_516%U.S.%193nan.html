Now, in his response to Stutson\'s petition for certiorari, the Solicitor General has reversed the Government\'s position. This change of position follows the unanimous view of the six Courts of Appeals that, unlike the Eleventh Circuit in this case, have expressly addressed this new and important issue, and have held that the <i>Pioneer </i>standard applies in Rule 4 cases. See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Clark, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/51/42/">51 F.3d 42</a>, 44 (CA5 1995) (Rule 4(b)); <i>United States </i>v. <i>Hooper, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/9/257/">9 F.3d 257</a>, 259 (CA2 1993) (same); <i>Chanute </i>v. <i>Williams Natural Gas </i><i>Co., </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/31/1041/">31 F.3d 1041</a>, 1045-1046 (CAlO 1994) (Rule 4(a)(5)), cert. denied, 513 U.

While "we \'should [not] mechanically accept any suggestion from the Solicitor General that a decision rendered in favor of the Government by a United States Court of Appeals was in error,\'" <i>Lawrence, ante, </i>at 171 (quoting <i>Mariscal </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/449/405/case.html">449 U. S. 405</a>, 406 (1981) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting)), this excep-</p><p><i>*Clark, Fink, Reynolds, </i>and <i>Virella-Nieves </i>were decided after the Court of Appeals in this case denied Stutson\'s petition for rehearing. <i>Chanute </i>and <i>Hooper </i>were decided after the District Court\'s decision in this case but before that of the Court of Appeals.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="196">196</a></p><p>Per Curiam</p><p>tional combination of circumstances presents ample justification for a GVR order. It appears to us that there is at least a reasonable probability that the Court of Appeals will reach a different conclusion on remand, and the equities clearly favor a GVR order.</p><p><i>If </i>the Court of Appeals here, in its summary affirmance, did not rely on the Government\'s primary argument and the lower court\'s basic premise-that <i>Pioneer </i>did not apply-it does not seem to us that we place an excessive burden on it, relative to Stutson\'s liberty and due process interests, by inviting it to clarify its ambiguous ruling. A contrary approach would risk effectively immunizing summary dispositions by courts of appeals from our review, since it is rare that their basis for decision is entirely unambiguous. See <i>Lawrence, ante, </i>at 170 (discussing <i>Netherland </i>v. <i>Tuggle, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/515/951/case.html">515 U. S. 951</a> (1995)). If, on the other hand, the Court of Appeals did not fully consider the applicability of <i>Pioneer, </i>or if it concluded that <i>Pioneer </i>does not apply under Rule 4, it might well conclude that while "[t]he law is the law," <i>ante, </i>at 184 (SCALIA, J., dissenting), the combination of the Government\'s change of position and the subsequent contrary decisions of four other Courts of Appeals shed light on the law applicable to this case. If it continues to conclude that <i>Pioneer </i>does not apply, it will be useful for us to have the benefit of its views so that we may resolve the resulting conflict between the Circuits.</p><p>Finally, it is not insignificant that this is a criminal case.</p><p>When a litigant is subject to the continuing coercive power of the Government in the form of imprisonment, our legal traditions reflect a certain solicitude for his rights, to which the important public interests in judicial efficiency and finality must occasionally be accommodated. We have previously refused to allow technicalities that caused no prejudice to the prosecution to preclude a remand under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2106 (1988 ed.) "in the interests of justice." <i>Wood</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="197">197</a></p><p>v. <i>Georgia, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/261/case.html">450 U. S. 261</a>, 265, n. 5 (1981). And procedural accommodations to prisoners are a familiar aspect of our jurisprudence. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i>28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2255 (1988 ed.) (habeas review in spite of an adverse final appellate decision); <i>Evitts </i>v. <i>Lucey, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/387/case.html">469 U. S. 387</a> (1985) (relief for ineffective assistance of retained counsel on appeal); <i>Schacht </i>v. <i>United States, 398 </i>U. S. 58, 63-64 (1970) (unlike in civil cases, time limits for petitions for certiorari in criminal cases are not jurisdictional). To the extent that the dissent suggests that it is inconsistent with our "traditional practice," <i>ante, </i>at 178 (opinion of SCALIA, J.), to call upon a Court of Appeals to reconsider its dismissal of a prisoner\'s appeal because his lawyer filed it one day late, in circumstances where the Court of Appeals\' decision may have been premised on the assumption, unanimously rejected by other Courts of Appeals, that more stringent rules as to filing deadlines apply to prisoners than to creditors filing claims in a bankruptcy proceeding, we must respectfully disagree.</p><p>Judicial efficiency and finality are important values, and our GVR power should not be exercised for "[m]ere convenience," cf. <i>Adams </i>v. <i>United States ex rel. McCann, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/269/case.html">317 U. S. 269</a>, 274 (1942). "But dry formalism should not sterilize procedural resources which Congress has made available to the federal courts." <i>Ibid. </i>In this case, as in <i>Lawrence </i>v. <i>Chater, </i>a GVR order guarantees to the petitioner full and fair consideration of his rights in light of all pertinent considerations, and is also satisfactory to the Government. In this case, as in <i>Lawrence, </i>a GVR order both promotes fairness and respects the dignity of the Court of Appeals by enabling it to consider potentially relevant decisions and arguments that were not previously before it.</p><p>Accordingly, the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis </i>and the petition for a writ of certiorari are granted.
