JUSTICE HOLMES delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a libel brought by the respondent to recover $219 for wages, subsistence and medical attendance, the libellant having been left at Honolulu, ill, in the course of a voyage from San Francisco to the Orient and return.  The defense is that he was not ill, that, ill or well, he should have remained upon the vessel, and further that he was discharged, and signed the mutual release required by Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 4552, and by that section made a bar.  The circuit court of appeals confirmed the finding of the district court that the libellant was not malingering, and, as we take it, although it is argued otherwise, also in finding that the doctor and master of the ship were willing that the libellant should go to the Marine Hospital.  The only question that we see reason for considering is whether the two courts were right in holding that the libellant was not concluded by the release.</p>\n<p>Both courts have found that the respondent was only asked to sign for his wages, that a discharge was not mentioned, and, to put it in our own way, that the purport of the overt acts in the circumstances was not to release the libellant\'s claim.  The petitioner cites the words of Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 4552, and <em>Rosenberg v. Doe,</em> 146 Mass.191, to show that such a position is impossible.  But the same case at a later stage, 148 Mass. 560, admitted a different result where the sailor knew too little English to understand the nature of the document and there was evidence that it was misstated to him.  In the present case, we have the further very important fact, which does not appear in the report of <em>Rosenberg v. Doe,</em> that the master did not give the respondent a certificate of discharge, as he was required to under a penalty of fifty dollars by Rev.Stats. \xc2\xa7 4551, if the respondent really was discharged.  Moreover, by a statute later in its present form than <em>Rosenberg v. Doe,</em> it is provided that, notwithstanding the statutory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="268">Page 258 U. S. 268</a></p><p> release, "any court having jurisdiction may upon good cause shown set aside such release and take such action as justice shall require."  Act of March 4, 1915, c. 153, \xc2\xa7 4; 38 Stat. 1164, 1165.  We are not prepared to say that the finding of the two courts was wrong.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
