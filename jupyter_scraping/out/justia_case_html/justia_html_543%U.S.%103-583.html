Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Section 16 requires this Court to look to the elements and nature of the offense of conviction in determining whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction falls within its ambit.  Florida\xe2\x80\x99s DUI statute, like similar statutes in many States, requires proof of causation but not of any mental state; and some other States appear to require only proof that a person acted negligently in operating the vehicle.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis begins with \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s language.  See <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a>, 144.  Particularly when interpreting a statute featuring as elastic a word as \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court construes language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it.  See <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 229.  Section 16(a)\xe2\x80\x99s critical aspect is that a crime of violence involves the \xe2\x80\x9cuse \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force against\xe2\x80\x9d another\xe2\x80\x99s person or property.  That requires active employment.  See <em>Bailey, supra, </em>at 145.  While one may, in theory, actively employ <em>something</em> in an accidental manner, it is much less natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another by accident.  When interpreting a statute, words must be given their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary or natural\xe2\x80\x9d meaning, <em>Smith, supra,</em> at 228, and \xc2\xa716(a)\xe2\x80\x99s key phrase most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI offense therefore is not a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(a).  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Nor is it a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(b), which sweeps more broadly than \xc2\xa716(a), but does not thereby encompass all negligent conduct, such as negligent operation of a vehicle.  It simply covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.  The classic example is burglary, which, by nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.  Thus, \xc2\xa716(b) contains the same formulation found to be determinative in \xc2\xa716(a): the use of physical force against another\xe2\x80\x99s person or property.  Accordingly, \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s language must be given an identical construction, requiring a higher <em>mens rea</em> than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a DUI offense.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The ordinary meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d which is what this Court is ultimately determining, combined with \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the use of physical force against another (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses.  This construction is reinforced by INA \xc2\xa7101(h), which includes as alternative definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal offense\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence, as defined in [\xc2\xa716],\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7101(h)(2), and a DUI-causing-injury offense, \xc2\xa7101(h)(3).  Interpreting \xc2\xa716 to include DUI offenses would leave \xc2\xa7101(h)(3) practically void of significance, in contravention of the rule that effect should be given to every word of a statute whenever possible, see <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U.

See Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7316.193(3)(c)(2) (2003).  Classifying this conviction as a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716, and therefore an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), an Immigration Judge and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) ordered that petitioner be deported pursuant to \xc2\xa7237(a) of the INA.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit agreed, dismissing petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s petition for review.  We disagree and hold that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI conviction is not a crime of violence under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner immigrated to the United States in 1980 and became a lawful permanent resident in 1987.  In January 2000, he was charged with two counts of DUI causing serious bodily injury under Fla. Stat. \xc2\xa7316.193(3)(c)(2), after he caused an accident resulting in injury to two people. He pleaded guilty to both counts and was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In November 2000, while he was serving his sentence, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) initiated removal proceedings against him pursuant to \xc2\xa7237(a) of the INA.  Under that provision, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny alien who is convicted of an aggravated felony \xe2\x80\xa6 is deportable\xe2\x80\x9d and may be removed upon an order of the Attorney General.  66 Stat. 201, 8 U.

Section 101(a)(43) of the INA defines \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d to include, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9ca crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18, but not including a purely political offense) for which the term of imprisonment [is] at least one year.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  8 U.

We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/1176/index.html">540 U.

We now reverse the Eleventh Circuit.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Title 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716 was enacted as part of the Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which broadly reformed the federal criminal code in such areas as sentencing, bail, and drug enforcement, and which added a variety of new violent and nonviolent offenses.  \xc2\xa71001(a), 98 Stat. 2136.  Congress employed the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d in numerous places in the Act, such as for defining the elements of particular offenses, see, <em>e.g.</em>, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71959 (prohibiting threats to commit crimes of violence in aid of racketeering activity), or for directing when a hearing is required before a charged individual can be released on bail, see<em> </em>\xc2\xa73142(f) (requiring a pretrial detention hearing for those alleged to have committed a crime of violence).  Congress therefore provided in \xc2\xa716 a general definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d to be used throughout the Act.  See \xc2\xa71001(a), 98 Stat. 2136.  Section 16 has since been incorporated into a variety of statutory provisions, both criminal and noncriminal.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, pursuant to \xc2\xa7237(a) of the INA, the Court of Appeals applied \xc2\xa716 to find that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI conviction rendered him deportable.  In determining whether petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction falls within the ambit of \xc2\xa716, the statute directs our focus to the \xe2\x80\x9coffense\xe2\x80\x9d of conviction.  See \xc2\xa716(a) (defining a crime of violence as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>an offense</em> that has <em>as an element</em> the use . . . of physical force against the person or property of another\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); \xc2\xa716(b) (defining the term as \xe2\x80\x9c<em>any other offense</em> that is a felony and that, <em>by its nature</em>, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  This language requires us to look to the elements and the nature of the offense of conviction, rather than to the particular facts relating to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s crime. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Florida Stat. \xc2\xa7316.193(3)(c)(2) makes it a third-degree felony for a person to operate a vehicle while under the influence and, \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of such operation, caus[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 [s]erious bodily injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Florida statute, while it requires proof of causation of injury, does not require proof of any particular mental state.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Hubbard</em>, 751 So.\xc2\xa02d 552, 562\xe2\x80\x93564 (Fla. 1999) (holding, in the context of a DUI manslaughter conviction under \xc2\xa7316.193, that the statute does not contain a <em>mens rea</em> requirement).  Many States have enacted similar statutes, criminalizing DUI causing serious bodily injury or death without requiring proof of any mental state,[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] or, in some States, appearing to require only proof that the person acted negligently in operating the vehicle.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The question here is whether \xc2\xa716 can be interpreted to include such offenses.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis begins with the language of the statute.  See <em>Bailey</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/137/index.html">516 U. S. 137</a>, 144 (1995).  The plain text of \xc2\xa716(a) states that an offense, to qualify as a crime of violence, must have \xe2\x80\x9cas an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person or property of another.\xe2\x80\x9d  We do not deal here with an <em>attempted</em> or <em>threatened</em> use of force.  Petitioner contends that his conviction did not require the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force against another person because the most common employment of the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d connotes the <em>intentional</em> availment of force, which is not required under the Florida DUI statute.  The Government counters that the \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d of force does not incorporate any <em>mens rea</em> component, and that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI conviction necessarily includes the use of force.  To support its position, the Government dissects the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d employing dictionaries, legislation, and our own case law in contending that a use of force may be negligent or even inadvertent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Whether or not the word \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d alone supplies a <em>mens rea</em> element, the parties\xe2\x80\x99 primary focus on that word is too narrow.  Particularly when interpreting a statute that features as elastic a word as \xe2\x80\x9cuse,\xe2\x80\x9d we construe language in its context and in light of the terms surrounding it.  See <em>Smith</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/508/223/index.html">508 U. S. 223</a>, 229 (1993); <em>Bailey,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 143.  The critical aspect of \xc2\xa716(a) is that a crime of violence is one involving the \xe2\x80\x9cuse \xe2\x80\xa6 of physical force <em>against the person or property of another</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  As we said in a similar context in <em>Bailey</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d requires active employment.  516 U. S., at 145. While one may, in theory, actively employ <em>something</em> in an accidental manner, it is much less natural to say that a person actively employs physical force against another person by<em> </em>accident.  Thus, a person would \xe2\x80\x9cuse . . . physical force against\xe2\x80\x9d another when pushing him; however, we would not ordinarily say a person \xe2\x80\x9cuse[s] . . . physical force against\xe2\x80\x9d another by stumbling and falling into him.  When interpreting a statute, we must give words their \xe2\x80\x9cordinary or natural\xe2\x80\x9d meaning.  <em>Smith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228.  The key phrase in \xc2\xa716(a)\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cuse . . . of physical force against the person or property of another\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94most naturally suggests a higher degree of intent than negligent or merely accidental conduct.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Trinidad-Aquino</em>, 259 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1145; <em>Bazan-Reyes</em> v. <em>INS</em>, 256 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 609.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI offense therefore is not a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither is petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s DUI conviction a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716(b). Section 16(b) sweeps more broadly than \xc2\xa716(a), defining a crime of violence as including \xe2\x80\x9cany other offense that is a felony and that, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used in the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  But \xc2\xa716(b) does not thereby encompass all negligent misconduct, such as the negligent operation of a vehicle.  It simply covers offenses that naturally involve a person acting in disregard of the risk that physical force might be used against another in committing an offense.  The reckless disregard in \xc2\xa716 relates <em>not</em> to the general conduct or to the possibility that harm will result from a person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, but to the risk that the use of physical force against another might be required in committing a crime.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The classic example is burglary.  A burglary would be covered under \xc2\xa716(b) <em>not</em> because the offense can be committed in a generally reckless way or because someone may be injured, but because burglary, by its nature, involves a substantial risk that the burglar will use force against a victim in completing the crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, while \xc2\xa716(b) is broader than \xc2\xa716(a) in the sense that physical force need not actually be applied, it contains the same formulation we found to be determinative in \xc2\xa716(a): the use of physical force against the person or property of another.  Accordingly, we must give the language in \xc2\xa716(b) an identical construction, requiring a higher <em>mens rea</em> than the merely accidental or negligent conduct involved in a DUI offense.  This is particularly true in light of \xc2\xa716(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d be a risk of using physical force against another person \xe2\x80\x9cin the course of committing the offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  In no \xe2\x80\x9cordinary or natural\xe2\x80\x9d sense can it be said that a person risks having to \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d physical force against another person in the course of operating a vehicle while intoxicated and causing injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In construing both parts of \xc2\xa716, we cannot forget that we ultimately are determining the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence.\xe2\x80\x9d  The ordinary meaning of this term, combined with \xc2\xa716\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the use of physical force against another person (or the risk of having to use such force in committing a crime), suggests a category of violent, active crimes that cannot be said naturally to include DUI offenses.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Doe</em>, 960 F.\xc2\xa02d 221, 225 (CA1 1992) (Breyer, C. J.) (observing that the term \xe2\x80\x9cviolent felony\xe2\x80\x9d in 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. II) \xe2\x80\x9ccalls to mind a tradition of crimes that involve the possibility of more closely related, active violence\xe2\x80\x9d).  Interpreting \xc2\xa716 to encompass accidental or negligent conduct would blur the distinction between the \xe2\x80\x9cviolent\xe2\x80\x9d crimes Congress sought to distinguish for heightened punishment and other crimes.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lucio-Lucio</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 1202, 1205\xe2\x80\x931206 (CA10 2003).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 16 therefore cannot be read to include petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction for DUI causing serious bodily injury under Florida law.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  This construction is reinforced by Congress\xe2\x80\x99 use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7101(h) of the INA, which was enacted in 1990.  See Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991, \xc2\xa7131, 104 Stat. 31 (hereinafter FRAA).  Section 212(a)(2)(E) of the INA renders inadmissible any alien who has previously exercised diplomatic immunity from criminal jurisdiction in the United States after committing a \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71182(a)(2)(E).  Section 101(h) defines the term \xe2\x80\x9cserious criminal offense\xe2\x80\x9d to mean:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c(1) any felony;</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(2) any crime of violence, as defined in section 16 of title 18; <em>or</em></p><em>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c(3) any crime of reckless driving or of driving while intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or of prohibited substances if such crime involves personal injury to another.\xe2\x80\x9d  8 U.

Interpreting \xc2\xa716 to include DUI offenses, as the Government urges, would leave \xc2\xa7101(h)(3) practically devoid of significance.  As we must give effect to every word of a statute wherever possible, see Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 174 (2001), the distinct provision for these offenses under \xc2\xa7101(h) bolsters our conclusion that \xc2\xa716 does not itself encompass DUI offenses.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case does not present us with the question whether a state or federal offense that requires proof of the <em>reckless</em> use of force against a person or property of another qualifies as a crime of violence under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.  DUI statutes such as Florida\xe2\x80\x99s do not require any mental state with respect to the use of force against another person, thus reaching individuals who were negligent or less.  Drunk driving is a nationwide problem, as evidenced by the efforts of legislatures to prohibit such conduct and impose appropriate penalties.  But this fact does not warrant our shoehorning it into statutory sections where it does not fit.  The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Congress first made commission of an aggravated felony grounds for an alien\xe2\x80\x99s removal in 1988, and it defined the term to include offenses such as murder, drug trafficking crimes, and firearm trafficking offenses.  See Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77342, 7344, 102 Stat. 4469, 4470.  Since then, Congress has frequently amended the definition of aggravated felony, broadening the scope of offenses which render an alien deportable.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, \xc2\xa7440(e), 110 Stat. 1277 (adding a number of offenses to \xc2\xa7101(a)(43) of the INA); Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), \xc2\xa7321, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93627 (same).  The inclusion of any \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as an aggravated felony came in 1990.  See Immigration Act of 1990, \xc2\xa7501, 104 Stat. 4978, 5048.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0When petitioner first appealed, the BIA\xe2\x80\x99s position was that a violation of DUI statutes similar to Florida\xe2\x80\x99s counted as a crime of violence under 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa716.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Matter of Puente-Salazar</em>, 22 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 1006, 1012\xe2\x80\x931013 (BIA 1999) (en banc).  Before petitioner received a decision from his appeal (due to a clerical error not relevant here), the BIA in another case reversed its position from <em>Puente-Salazar</em> and held that DUI offenses that do not have a <em>mens rea</em> of at least recklessness are not crimes of violence within the meaning of \xc2\xa716.  See <em>Matter of Ramos</em>, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N. Dec. 336, 346 (BIA 2002) (en banc).  However, because the BIA held in <em>Ramos</em> that it would \xe2\x80\x9cfollow the law of the circuit in those circuits that have addressed the question whether driving under the influence is a crime of violence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 346\xe2\x80\x93347, and because it found the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s ruling in <em>Le</em> controlling, it affirmed the Immigration Judge\xe2\x80\x99s removal order.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71252(a)(2)(C).  Because the Eleventh Circuit held that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was such an offense, it concluded that it had no jurisdiction to consider the removal order.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0For instance, a number of statutes criminalize conduct that has as an element the commission of a crime of violence under \xc2\xa716.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7842(p) (prohibiting the distribution of information relating to explosives, destructive devices, and weapons of mass destruction in relation to a crime of violence).  Other statutory provisions make classification of an offense as a crime of violence consequential for purposes of, <em>inter alia,</em> extradition and restitution. See<em> </em>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73181(b), 3663A(c).  And the term \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa716 has been incorporated into a number of noncriminal enactments.

The \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa716(b) relates to the use of force, not to the possible effect of a person\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  Compare \xc2\xa716(b) (requiring a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial risk that physical force against the person or property of another may be used\xe2\x80\x9d), with United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa74B1.2(a)(2) (Nov. 2003) (in the context of a career-offender sentencing enhancement, defining \xe2\x80\x9ccrime of violence\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cconduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another\xe2\x80\x9d).  The risk that an accident may occur when an individual drives while intoxicated is simply not the same thing as the risk that the individual may \xe2\x80\x9cuse\xe2\x80\x9d physical force against another in committing the DUI offense.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lucio-Lucio</em>, 347 F.\xc2\xa03d 1202, 1205\xe2\x80\x931207 (CA10 2003); <em>Bazan-Reyes</em>, v. <em>INS,</em> 256 F.\xc2\xa03d 600, 609\xe2\x80\x93610 (CA7 2001).</p>\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Even if \xc2\xa716 lacked clarity on this point, we would be constrained to interpret any ambiguity in the statute in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  Although here we deal with \xc2\xa716 in the deportation context, \xc2\xa716 is a criminal statute, and it has both criminal and noncriminal applications.  Because we must interpret the statute consistently, whether we encounter its application in a criminal or noncriminal context, the rule of lenity applies.  Cf. <em>United States</em> v. <em>Thompson/Center Arms Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/505/index.html">504 U.

Congress incorporated \xc2\xa716 as an aggravated felony under \xc2\xa7101(a)(43)(F) of the INA in 1990.  See Immigration Act of 1990, \xc2\xa7501, 104 Stat. 5048 (Nov. 29, 1990).  Congress enacted \xc2\xa7101(h), with its incorporation of \xc2\xa716 <em>and</em> a separate provision covering DUI-causing-injury offenses, just nine months earlier.  See FRAA, \xc2\xa7131, 104 Stat. 31 (Feb. 16, 1990).  That Congress distinguished between a crime of violence and DUI-causing-injury offenses (and included both) in \xc2\xa7101(h), but did not do so shortly thereafter in making only a crime of violence an aggravated felony under \xc2\xa7101(a)(43)(F), strongly supports our construction of \xc2\xa716.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
