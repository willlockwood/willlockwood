The Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company was, in equity, the owner of the property when the lease was made, and when the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company went into possession under it.  The deed executed in February, 1872, pursuant to the contract of purchase, converted the equitable title of the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company into a legal title, which at once, by operation of law, inured to the benefit of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company under its lease.  All the rights of William B. Skidmore as against the property accrued long after those of the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company, and are subject to the title of that company.  Such being the case, it is entirely unnecessary to inquire whether the Skidmores acquired a valid title to the property as against the Columbus, Chicago &amp; Indiana Central Company.  The Pittsburgh, Cincinnati &amp; St. Louis Company is entitled to the possession, whether that title be good or bad.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment is affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
