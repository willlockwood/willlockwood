S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE McREYNOLDS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Since December, 1905, the appellant, Behn, Meyer &amp; Co., Limited, has been a corporation organized under the laws of the Straits Settlements, a crown colony of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.  It has never been a resident of, nor has it done business within, the territory of any nation at war with the United States since April 6, 1917, or an ally of such nation.  Prior to February, 1918, under the supervision of Menzi, a stockholder and citizen of Switzerland, it carried on business in the Philippine Islands.  During that month, and while subjects of Germany held most of its stock, the Alien Property Custodian, claiming authority under the Trading with the Enemy Act, seized and converted into cash the corporation\'s assets found in those islands.  The proceeds are held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States.</p>\n<p>Alleging that its property had been improperly seized and the proceeds were being unjustly withheld, the company brought suit to recover them in the Supreme Court, District of Columbia, July 28, 1922.  Upon motion, the trial court dismissed the petition, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the decree.</p>\n<p>Following much consideration, Congress passed the original Trading with the Enemy Act, approved October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. 411, c. 106).  It is long (19 sections), rather complicated, and evinces the purpose to clothe the President with definitely restricted powers in respect of seizing property of those designated as enemies.  It has been amended several times, but has always contained the original provisions (\xc2\xa7 9) allowing recovery </p><p><a class="page-number" name="463">Page 266 U. S. 463</a></p><p> of seized property which did not in fact belong to an enemy.</p>\n<p>"By \xc2\xa7 9, as twice amended, anyone \'not an enemy or ally of enemy\' claiming any interest, right or title in any money or other property so sequestered and held may give notice of his claim and institute a suit in equity. . . .  [The act] distinctly reserves to any claimant who is neither an enemy nor an ally of an enemy a right to assert and establish his claim by a suit in equity unembarrassed by the precedent executive determination.  Not only so, but, pending the suit, which the claimant may bring as promptly after the seizure as he chooses, the property is to be retained by the Custodian to abide the result, and, if the claimant prevails, is to be forthwith returned to him.  Thus, there is provision for the return of property mistakenly sequestered, and we have no hesitation in pronouncing it adequate, for it enables the claimant, as of right, to obtain a full hearing on his claim in a court having power to enforce it if found meritorious."</p>\n<p><em>Stoeher v.

The original section, quoted above, was reenacted as subsection (a).  It provides for recovery when the seized property belonged to one not an "enemy or ally of enemy," where the taking was in fact without warrant of law.  Six subsections -- (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), and (g) -- were added.  Subsection (b) permits recovery by some within the definition of "enemy" whose properly had been lawfully seized.  Each of its eight numbered paragraphs include such persons.  Subsection (c) and those parts of subsection (b) here specially important follow.  All of subsection (b) is printed below.

Each of these empowers certain persons to recover property or funds held by the Alien Property Custodian, and is broad enough to include some always within the general definition of "enemy."  Paragraph 11 follows:</p>\n<p>"Subsec.(b), par. (11)  A partnership, association, or other unincorporated body of individuals, having its principal place of business within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, or a corporation, organized or incorporated within any country other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary, and that the control of, or more than 50 percentum </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 266 U. S. 471</a></p><p> of the interests or voting power in, any such partnership, association, other unincorporated body of individuals, or corporation was at such time, and is at the time of the return of any money or other property, vested in citizens or subjects of nations, states, or free cities other than Germany, Austria, Hungary, or Austria-Hungary:  <em>Provided, however,</em> that this subsection shall not affect any rights which any citizen or subject may have under paragraph (1) of this subsection."</p>\n<p>Appellant maintains that it was never an enemy or ally of enemy within the statutory definitions, that only property of persons so described was properly subject to seizure, and, as it was neither enemy nor ally of enemy, the provisions of \xc2\xa7 9, subsection (a) (always part of the act) in plain terms permit it to recover unlawfully seized property or the proceeds.</p>\n<p>On the other side, the insistence is that subsection (c) of \xc2\xa7 7 permitted seizure of appellant\'s property because held "on account of, or on behalf of, or for the benefit of" stockholders, the majority of whom were enemy subjects of Germany.  Further, that, although appellant\'s property may have been taken originally without authority, return of it is now impliedly prohibited by subsection (b) of \xc2\xa7 9, as amended (acts of 1920 and 1923), since this subsection applies in terms to</p>\n<p>"all money or other property conveyed transferred, assigned, delivered, or paid to the Alien Property Custodian or seized by him hereunder and held by him or by the Treasurer of the United States,"</p>\n<p>whether taken lawfully or no.  Paragraphs 6 and 11 are specially relied upon, and it is said that they specify the only classes of corporations now permitted to recover, and do not include appellant.</p>\n<p>We think subsection (a) of \xc2\xa7 9 gives now, as the same words gave from the first, the right of recovery to any person never "an enemy or ally of enemy" within the statutory definitions.  <em>Stoehr v. Wallace, supra.</em>  The </p><p><a class="page-number" name="472">Page 266 U. S. 472</a></p><p> contrary view, urged by appellees, would greatly qualify, perhaps delete, this subsection, and would place the United States in the unenviable position of positively refusing, after hostilities had ended, to give up property which had been taken contrary to their own laws.  It would require very clear words to convince us that Congress intended any such thing.</p>\n<p>Subsection (b) adds to those allowed to recover from the first a considerable number always within the definition of "enemy," and affords to them the measure of relief which Congress deemed proper long after peace had been actually restored.  And this accords with the spirit of the provision in \xc2\xa7 12:</p>\n<p>"After the end of the war, any claim of any enemy or of an ally of enemy to any money or other property received and held by the Alien Property Custodian or deposited in the United States Treasury shall be settled as Congress shall direct."</p>\n<p>Before its passage, the original Trading with the Enemy Act was considered in the light of difficulties certain to follow disregard of corporate identity and efforts to fix the status of corporations as enemy or not according to the nationality of stockholders.  These had been plainly indicated by the diverse opinions in <em>Daimler Company, Limited v. Continental Tyre &amp; Rubber Co.,</em> 2 A.C. [1916] 307, decided June 30, 1916.</p>\n<p>Section 7, subsection (c), was never intended, we think, to empower the President to seize corporate property merely because of enemy stockholders\' interests therein.  Corporations are brought within the carefully framed definitions (\xc2\xa7 2) of "enemy" and "ally of enemy" by the words:</p>\n<p>"Any corporation incorporated within such territory of any nation with which the United States is at war [or any nation which is an ally of such nation] or incorporated within any country other than the United States and doing business within such territory."</p>\n<p>And </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 266 U. S. 473</a></p><p> we find no adequate support for the suggestion that Congress authorized the taking of property of other corporations because one or more stockholders were enemies.  Logically carried out, this view would have permitted the seizure of all property of companies incorporated by any associated power -- <em>e.g.,</em> Great Britain -- solely because some German held one share of the many thousands.  The result indicates that the premise is bad.  What the President might do was plainly set down in well considered words.</p>\n<p>The challenged decree must be reversed, and the cause will be remanded to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia for further proceedings in conformity with this opinion.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>"Whether the objection would be good if it turned entirely on the words of \xc2\xa7 7c, on which the plaintiff relies, we need not consider, for they obviously are qualified and explained by \xc2\xa7 5, which very plainly enables the President to exercise his power under \xc2\xa7 7c \'through such officer or officers as he shall direct.\'  By the orders already noticed, the President directed that this power be exercised through the Alien Property Custodian.  It therefore is as if the words relied on had been \'which the President, acting through the Alien Property Custodian, shall determine after investigation\' is enemy-owned, etc.  In short, a personal determination by the President is not required; he may act through the Custodian, and a determination by the latter is, in effect, the act of the President."</p>\n<p><em>Stoehr v.
