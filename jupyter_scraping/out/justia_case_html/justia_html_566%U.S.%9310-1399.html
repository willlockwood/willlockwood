Benefits for most types of disabilities are capped at twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an injured employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7906(c).  The LHWCA requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily, without formal administrative proceedings.  Typically, employers pay benefits without contesting liability, so no compensation orders are issued.  However,  if an employer controverts liability, or an employee contests his employer\xe2\x80\x99s actions with respect to his benefits, the dispute proceeds to the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs (OWCP) to be resolved, if possible, through informal procedures.  An informal disposition may result in a compensation order.  If not resolved informally, the dispute is referred to an administrative law judge (ALJ), who conducts a hearing and issues a compensation order.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fiscal year 2002, petitioner Roberts was injured at an Alaska marine terminal while working for respondent Sea-Land Services, Inc.  Sea-Land (except for six weeks in 2003) voluntarily paid Roberts benefits until fiscal year 2005.  Roberts then filed an LHWCA claim, and Sea-Land controverted.  In fiscal year 2007, an ALJ awarded Roberts benefits at the fiscal year 2002 statutory maximum rate.  Roberts sought reconsideration, contending that the award should have been set at the higher statutory maximum rate for fiscal year 2007, when, he argued, he was \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d by order of the ALJ.  The ALJ denied his motion, and the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Benefits Review Board affirmed, concluding that the pertinent maximum rate is determined by the date disability commences.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0An employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d when he first becomes disabled and thereby becomes statutorily entitled to benefits, no matter whether, or when, a compensation order issues on his behalf.  Pp. 5\xe2\x88\x9218.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0Roberts contends that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d means \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation in a formal order,\xe2\x80\x9d while Sea-Land and the Director, OWCP, maintain that it means \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily entitled to compensation because of disability.\xe2\x80\x9d  Although \xc2\xa7906 can be interpreted either way, only Sea-Land and the Director\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation makes \xc2\xa7906 a working part of the statutory scheme.  Under Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation, no employee receiving voluntary payments has been \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d so none is subject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.  That result is incompatible with the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s design.  Section 906(b)(1) caps compensation at twice the applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary of Labor.  Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to determine that wage before each fiscal year begins, at which time it becomes the \xe2\x80\x9capplicable national average weekly wage\xe2\x80\x9d for the coming fiscal year.  And \xc2\xa7906(c), in its turn, provides that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s determination shall apply to those \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d during such fiscal year.  Through a series of cross-references, the three provisions work together to cap disability benefits.  By its terms, and subject to one express exception, \xc2\xa7906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all disability claims.  Because all three provisions interlock, the cap functions as Congress intended only if \xc2\xa7906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases.  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation would give \xc2\xa7906(c) no application in the many cases in which no formal orders issue.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUsing the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative structure.  An employer must be able to calculate the cap in order to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s disability, see \xc2\xa7914(b), and in order to certify to the Department of Labor whether the maximum rate is being paid.  Similarly, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the compensation rate in light of the applicable cap.  It is difficult to see how an employer or claims examiner can use a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.  Moreover, applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to compensate disability, defined as \xe2\x80\x9cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7902(10).  It also avoids disparate treatment of similarly situated employees; Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 reading would permit two employees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day to receive different maximum compensation rates based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.  Finally, applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process.  If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national average wage rises each year with inflation would be unduly significant.  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 rule would reward employees who receive voluntary payments with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings to secure a higher rate, while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations to make voluntary payments.

First, although the LHWCA sometimes uses \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9caward in a formal order,\xe2\x80\x9d the presumption that identical words used in different parts of the same Act are intended to have the same meaning, readily yields whenever, as here, the variation in the word\xe2\x80\x99s use in the LHWCA reasonably warrants the conclusion that it was employed in different parts of the Act with different intent.  See General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 581\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, Roberts argues that, because this Court has refused to read the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7933(g) to mean \xe2\x80\x9cperson awarded compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469\n, the converse must also be true: \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7906(c) cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9centitled to compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Cowart\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning does not work in reverse.  Cowart did not construe \xc2\xa7906(c) or \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d see id., at 478\xe2\x80\x93479, and it did not hold that the groups of \xe2\x80\x9cemployees entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployees awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d were mutually exclusive, see id., at 477.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, Roberts contends that his interpretation furthers the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose of providing employees with prompt compensation by encouraging employers to avoid delay and expedite administrative proceedings.  But his remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their employees\xe2\x80\x99 injuries, because they would owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to file claims.  The more measured deterrent to employer delay is interest that accrues from the date an unpaid benefit came due.

At first blush, Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 position is appealing.  In ordinary usage, \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d most often means \xe2\x80\x9cgive by judicial decree\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cassign after careful judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002); see also, e.g., Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cgrant by formal process or by judicial decree\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d can also mean \xe2\x80\x9cgrant,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cconfer or bestow upon.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary, at 152; see also ibid.

Indeed, this Court has often said that statutes \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d entitlements.  See, e.g., Astrue v.

As explained above, see supra, at 3, the LHWCA requires employers to pay benefits voluntarily, and in the vast majority of cases, that is just what occurs.  Under Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xc2\xa7906(c), no employee receiving voluntary payments has been \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d so none is subject to an identifiable maximum rate of compensation.  That result is incompatible with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s design.  Sec- tion 906(b)(1) caps \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompensation for disability or death (other than compensation for death required .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to be paid in a lump sum)\xe2\x80\x9d at twice \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicable national average weekly wage, as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (3).\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 906(b)(3), in turn, directs the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cdetermine\xe2\x80\x9d the national average weekly wage before each fiscal year begins on October 1 and provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]uch determination shall be the applicable national average weekly wage\xe2\x80\x9d for the coming fiscal year.  And \xc2\xa7906(c), in its turn, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]eterminations under subsection (b)(3) .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with respect to\xe2\x80\x9d a fiscal year \xe2\x80\x9cshall apply to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. those newly awarded compensation during such\xe2\x80\x9d fiscal year.  Through a series of cross-references, the three provisions work together to cap disability benefits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy its terms, and subject to one express exception, \xc2\xa7906(b)(1) specifies that the cap applies globally, to all disability claims.  But all three provisions interlock, so the cap functions as Congress intended only if \xc2\xa7906(c) also applies globally, to all such cases.  See, e.g., FDA v. Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 120, \n133 (2000)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA court must .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. interpret the statute \xe2\x80\x98as a symmetrical and coherent regulatory scheme\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., \n\n513 U.\xc2\xa0S. 561, \n569 (1995)\n)).  If Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation were correct, \xc2\xa7906(c) would have no application at all in the many cases in which no formal orders issue, because employers make voluntary payments or the parties reach informal settlements.  We will not construe \xc2\xa7906(c) in a manner that renders it \xe2\x80\x9centirely superfluous in all but the most unusual circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  TRW Inc. v. Andrews, \n\n534 U.\xc2\xa0S. 19, \n29 (2001)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t Recognizing this deficiency in his reading of \xc2\xa7906(c), Roberts proposes that orders issue in every case, so that employers can lock in the caps in effect at the time their employees become disabled.  This is a solution in search of a problem.  Under settled LHWCA practice, orders are rare.  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation would set needless administrative machinery in motion and would disrupt the congressionally preferred system of voluntary compensation and informal dispute resolution.  The incongruity of Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 proposal is highlighted by his inability to identify a vehicle for the entry of an order in an uncontested case.  Section 919(c), on which Roberts relies, applies only if an employee has filed a claim.  Likewise, 20 CFR \xc2\xa7702.315(a) applies only in the case of a claim or an employer\xe2\x80\x99s no- tice of controversion.  See \xc2\xa7702.301.  We doubt that an em- ployee will file a claim for the sole purpose of assisting his employer in securing a lower cap.  And we will not read \xc2\xa7906(c) to compel an employer to file a baseless notice of controversion.  Cf. 33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7928(a), (d) (providing for assessment of attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees and costs against employers who controvert unsuccessfully).  Roberts suggests that employers could threaten to terminate benefits in order to induce their employees to file claims, and thus initiate the administrative process.  Construing any workers\xe2\x80\x99 compensation regime to encourage gratuitous confrontation between employers and employees strikes us as unsound.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUsing the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled coheres with the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s administrative structure.  Section 914(b) requires an employer to pay benefits within 14 days of notice of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s disability.  To do so, an employer must be able to calculate the cap.  An employer must also notify the Department of Labor of voluntary payments by filing a form that indicates, inter alia, whether the \xe2\x80\x9cmaximum rate is being paid.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dept. of Labor, Form LS\xe2\x80\x93206, Payment of Compensation Without Award (2011), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/ls-206.pdf.  On receipt of this form, an OWCP claims examiner must verify the rate of compensation in light of the applicable cap.  See Dept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93201(3)(b)(3) (hereinafter Longshore Procedure Man- ual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2-201.htm.  It is difficult to see how an employer can apply or certify a national average weekly wage other than the one in effect at the time an employee becomes disabled.  An employer is powerless to predict when an employee might file a claim, when a compensation order might issue, or what the national average weekly wage will be at that later time.  Likewise for a claims examiner.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, applying the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which an employee becomes disabled advances the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s purpose to compensate disability, defined as \xe2\x80\x9cincapacity because of injury to earn the wages which the employee was receiving at the time of injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7902(10) (emphasis added).  Just as the LHWCA takes \xe2\x80\x9cthe average weekly wage of the injured employee at the time of the injury\xe2\x80\x9d as the \xe2\x80\x9cbasis upon which to compute compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7910, it is logical to apply the national average weekly wage for the same point in time.  Administrative practice has long treated the time of injury as the relevant date.  See, e.g., Dept. of Labor, Pamphlet LS\xe2\x80\x93560, Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Under the Longshoremen\xe2\x80\x99s Act (rev. Dec. 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cCompensation payable under the Act may not exceed 200% of the national average weekly wage, applicable at the time of injury\xe2\x80\x9d), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/LS-560pam.htm; Dept. of Labor, Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Under the Longshoremen\xe2\x80\x99s Act, Pamphlet LS\xe2\x80\x93560 (rev. Nov. 1979) (same); see also, e.g., Dept. of Labor, LHWCA Bulletin No. 11\xe2\x80\x9301, p.\xc2\xa02 (2010) (national average weekly wage for particular fiscal year applies to \xe2\x80\x9cdisability incurred during\xe2\x80\x9d that fiscal year).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying the national average weekly wage at the time of onset of disability avoids disparate treatment of simi- larly situated employees.  Under Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 reading, two em- ployees who earn the same salary and suffer the same injury on the same day could be entitled to different rates of compensation based on the happenstance of their obtaining orders in different fiscal years.  We can imagine no reason why Congress would have intended, by choosing the words \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d to differentiate between employees based on such an arbitrary criterion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, using the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which disability commences discourages gamesmanship in the claims process.  If the fiscal year in which an order issues were to determine the cap, the fact that the national average weekly wage typically rises every year with inflation, see n.\xc2\xa02, supra, would become unduly significant.  Every employee affected by the cap would seek the entry of a compensation order in a later fiscal year.  Even an employee who has been receiving compensation at the proper rate for years would be well advised to file a claim for greater benefits in order to obtain an order at a later time.  Likewise, an employee might delay the adjudicatory process to defer the entry of an order.  And even in an adjudicated case where an employer is found to have paid benefits at the proper rate, an ALJ would adopt the later fiscal year\xe2\x80\x99s national average weekly wage, making the increased cap retroactively applicable to all of the employer\xe2\x80\x99s payments.  Roberts candidly acknowledges that his position gives rise to such perverse incentives.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 58\xe2\x80\x9359.  We decline to adopt a rule that would reward employees with windfalls for initiating unnecessary administrative proceedings, while simultaneously punishing employers who have complied fully with their statutory obligations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe find Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 counterarguments unconvincing.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, Roberts observes that some provisions of the LHWCA clearly use \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9caward in a formal order,\xe2\x80\x9d and contends that the same must be true of \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7906(c).  We agree that the Act sometimes uses \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d as Roberts urges.  Section 914(a), for example, refers to the payment of compensation \xe2\x80\x9cto the person entitled thereto, without an award,\xe2\x80\x9d foreclosing the equation of \xe2\x80\x9centitlement\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d that we adopt with respect to \xc2\xa7906(c) today.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But the presumption that \xe2\x80\x9cidentical words used in different parts of the same act are intended to have the same meaning .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. readily yields whenever there is such variation in the connection in which the words are used as reasonably to warrant the conclusion that they were employed in different parts of the act with different intent.\xe2\x80\x9d  General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v.

Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., \n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 200, \n213 (2001)\n.  Here, we find the presumption overcome because several provisions of the Act would make no sense if \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d were read as Roberts proposes.  Those provisions confirm today\xe2\x80\x99s holding because they too, in context, use \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d to denote a statutory entitlement to compensation because of disability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor example, \xc2\xa7908(c)(20) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]roper and equitable compensation not to exceed $7,500 shall be awarded for serious disfigurement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Roberts argues that \xc2\xa7908(c)(20) \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily contemplates administrative action to fix the amount of the liability and direct its payment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 11.  In Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 view, no disfigured employee may receive benefits without in- voking the administrative claims process.  That argu- ment, however, runs counter to \xc2\xa7908\xe2\x80\x99s preface, which directs that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ompensation for disability shall be paid to the employee,\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xc2\xa7914(a), which requires the payment of compensation \xe2\x80\x9cwithout an award.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is also belied by employers\xe2\x80\x99 practice of paying \xc2\xa7908(c)(20) benefits voluntarily.  See, e.g., Williams-McDowell v. Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Co., No. 99\xe2\x80\x930627 etc., 2000 WL 35928576, *1 (BRB, Mar. 15, 2000) (per\xc2\xa0curiam); Evans v.

In light of the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s interest in prompt payment and settled practice, \xe2\x80\x9cawarded\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7908(c)(20) can only be better read, as in \xc2\xa7906(c), to refer to a disfigured employee\xe2\x80\x99s entitlement to benefits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0Likewise, \xc2\xa7908(d)(1) provides that if an employee who is receiving compensation for a scheduled disability\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t dies before receiving the full amount of compensation to which the schedule entitles him, \xe2\x80\x9cthe total amount of the award unpaid at the time of death shall be payable to or for the benefit of his survivors.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also \xc2\xa7908(d)(2).  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d would introduce an odd gap: Only survivors of those employees who were receiving schedule benefits pursuant to orders\xe2\x80\x94not survivors of employees who were receiving voluntary payments\xe2\x80\x94would be entitled to the unpaid balances due their decedents.  There is no reason why Congress would have chosen to distinguish between survivors in this manner.  And the Benefits Review Board has quite sensibly interpreted \xc2\xa7908(d) to mean that \xe2\x80\x9can employee has a vested interest in benefits which accrue during his lifetime, and, after he dies, his estate is entitled to those benefits, regardless of when an award is made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wood v.

Brief for Petitioner 29; see 461 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 534 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe term \xe2\x80\x98compensation order\xe2\x80\x99 in the LHWCA refers specifi- cally to an administrative award of compensation following proceedings with respect to the claim\xe2\x80\x9d).  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 argument offends the canon against superfluity and neglects that \xc2\xa7933(b) defines the term \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d whereas Pallas Shipping defines the term \xe2\x80\x9ccompensation order.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d which tracks Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 preferred interpretation, was carefully limited to \xc2\xa7933(b).  Had Congress intended to adopt a universal definition of \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d it could have done so in \xc2\xa7902, the LHWCA\xe2\x80\x99s glossary.  Read in light of the \xe2\x80\x9cduty to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,\xe2\x80\x9d Duncan v. Walker, \n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 167, \n174 (2001)\n (internal quotation marks omitted), \xc2\xa7933(b) debunks Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 argument that the Act always uses \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9caward in a formal order\xe2\x80\x9d and confirms that \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d has other meanings.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNext, Roberts notes that this Court has refused to read the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7933(g) to mean \xe2\x80\x9cperson awarded compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469, \n477 (1992)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] person entitled to compensation need not be receiving compensation or have had an adjudication in his favor\xe2\x80\x9d).  In Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 view, the converse must also be true: \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7906(c) cannot mean \xe2\x80\x9centitled to compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  But Cowart\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning does not work in reverse.  Cowart did not construe \xc2\xa7906(c) or the term \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d but relied on the uniform meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cperson entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in the LHWCA.  See id., at 478\xe2\x80\x93479.  As just explained, the LHWCA contains no uniform meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9caward.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, Cowart did not hold that the groups of \xe2\x80\x9cemployees entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cemployees awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d were mutually exclusive.  The former group includes the latter: The entry of a compensation order is a sufficient but not necessary condition for membership in the former.

But Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 remedy would also punish employers who voluntarily pay benefits at the proper rate from the time of their employees\xe2\x80\x99 injuries.  These employers would owe benefits under the higher cap applicable in any future fiscal year when their employees chose to file claims.  And Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 remedy would offer no relief at all to the many beneficiaries entitled to less than the statutory maximum rate.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe more measured deterrent to employer tardiness is interest that \xe2\x80\x9caccrues from the date a benefit came due, rather than from the date of the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s award.\xe2\x80\x9d  Matulic v.

But reading \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d as synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9creceiving compensation\xe2\x80\x9d is farther from the ordinary meaning of \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach: A person who slipped and fell on a negligently maintained sidewalk would not say that she had been \xe2\x80\x9cawarded money damages\xe2\x80\x9d if the business responsible for the sidewalk voluntarily paid her hospital bills.

For example, Justice Ginsburg determines that Roberts is entitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002, to July 15, 2003, because Sea-Land was making voluntary payments during that time.  Post, at 6.  But Sea-Land was paying Roberts $933.82 per week, less than the $966.08 that the ALJ found Roberts was entitled to receive.  Compare App. to Pet. for Cert. 101 with id., at 107, Order \xc2\xb61.  If any voluntary payment suffices, regardless of an employee\xe2\x80\x99s actual entitlement, then an employer can hedge against a later finding of liability by paying the smallest amount to which the Act might entitle an employee but controverting liability as to the remainder.  See, e.g., R. M. v. Sabre Personnel Assocs., Inc., 41 BRBS 727, 730 (2007).  An employer who controverts is not subject to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s delinquency penalty.  See \n.  Perhaps Justice Ginsburg gives Sea-Land the benefit of the doubt because its voluntary payments were close to Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 actual entitlement.  But if that is so, then how close is close enough?\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Roberts accurately notes that in some cases, the time of injury and the time of onset of disability differ.

From that principle, lower courts have rightly concluded that when dates of injury and onset of disability diverge, the latter is the relevant date for determining the applicable national average weekly wage.  See, e.g., Service Employees International, Inc. v. Director, OWCP, 595 F.\xc2\xa03d 447, 456 (CA2 2010); Kubin v. Pro-Football, Inc., 29 BRBS 117 (1995) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).\nLikewise, in a small group of cases\xe2\x80\x94those in which disability lasts more than 3 but less than 15 days\xe2\x80\x94the time of onset of disability and the time of entitlement will differ.

See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7914(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  That result would conflict with \xc2\xa7908(c)(22)\xe2\x80\x99s text, which states that consecutive payments must be made \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n any case\xe2\x80\x9d involving multiple scheduled disabilities.  See, e.g., Thornton v. Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding, Inc., 44 BRBS 111 (2010) (per\xc2\xa0curiam).\nSimilarly, \xc2\xa7910(h)(1) sets out two formulas for increasing benefitsfor pre-1972 disability or death in light of the higher rates Congress provided in the 1972 LHWCA amendments.  The first applies to those receiving compensation at the then-applicable maximum rate; the second applies to those \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. at less than the maximum rate.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Dept. of Labor, OWCP Bulletin No. 10\xe2\x80\x9373, Adjustment of Compensation for Total Permanent Disability or Death Prior to LS/HW Amendments of 1972, pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x934 (1973).  Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 interpretation would make the second formula applicable only to beneficiaries receiving less than the maximum rate pursuant to orders, not to all such beneficiaries.  Again, there is no reason to believe that Congress intended this distinction, nor has OWCP applied it.  See ibid.

Specifically, \xc2\xa7906 states that an injured employee may receive, at most, twice the national average weekly wage for the fiscal year in which the employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7906(c).  The Court granted review in this case to answer the following question: When is an employee \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPetitioner Dana Roberts contends that an employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in the year she receives a formal compensation award.  For the reasons cogently explained by the majority, that argument is untenable.  See ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x9317.  Unlike the Court, however, I do not regard as reasonable respondent Sea-Land Services\xe2\x80\x99 view that an employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in the year she becomes \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily entitled to compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Applying the common meaning of the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d and recognizing the Act\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between benefits paid voluntarily, and those paid pursuant to a compensation order, see ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, I would hold that an injured worker is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d when (1) the employer voluntarily undertakes to pay benefits to the employee, or (2) an administrative law judge (ALJ), the Benefits Review Board (BRB), or a reviewing court orders the employer to pay such benefits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn determining the meaning of a statutory phrase, \xe2\x80\x9cwe look first to its language, giving the words used their ordinary meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moskal v. United States, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103, \n108 (1990)\n (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).  As the Court acknowledges, ante, at 5, the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily means \xe2\x80\x9cto give by judicial decree\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[to] assign after careful judgment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 152 (2002).  See also Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 157 (9th ed. 2009) (defining the verb \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]o grant by formal process or by judicial decree\xe2\x80\x9d).  Giving \xe2\x80\x9caward\xe2\x80\x9d this usual meaning, an employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation,\xe2\x80\x9d if not voluntarily paid, in the fis- cal year in which payment is directed by administrative order or judicial decree.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tUnder the LHWCA, the Court recognizes, an employee is provided compensation voluntarily or in contested proceedings.  See ante, at 3.  Most commonly, an employer pays compensation voluntarily after receiving an employee\xe2\x80\x99s notice of disabling injury.  See Pallas Shipping Agency, Ltd. v. Duris, \n\n461 U.\xc2\xa0S. 529, \n532 (1983)\n; \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7912 (describing the form, content, and timing of the necessary notice and requiring employers to designate a representative to receive the notice); \xc2\xa7914(b).  If an employer declines to pay compensation voluntarily, an injured employee can file a claim with the Department of Labor\xe2\x80\x99s Office of Workers\xe2\x80\x99 Compensation Programs (OWCP).  For employees with valid claims, OWCP proceedings culminate with an administrative or court decision ordering the employer to pay benefits.  \xc2\xa7919(c).  Thus, an injured worker is given\xe2\x80\x94or \xe2\x80\x9cawarded\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94compensation through one of two means contemplated by the Act: either the employer voluntarily pays compensation or is officially ordered to do so.  Logically, then, the worker is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d when one of those two events occurs.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court does not take this approach.  After acknowledging that it is not relying on the typical meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9caward,\xe2\x80\x9d see ante, at 5, the Court adopts Sea-Land\xe2\x80\x99s view that \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d is synonymous with \xe2\x80\x9c[became] statutorily entitled to benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 18.  As a result, a person is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in the year in which she becomes entitled to benefits\xe2\x80\x94i.e., in the year the employee \xe2\x80\x9cfirst becomes disabled.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Such a reading is plausible, the Court asserts, because \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court has often said that statutes \xe2\x80\x98award\xe2\x80\x99 entitlements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6 (citing cases).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI do not dispute that statutes are often characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cawarding\xe2\x80\x9d relief to persons falling within their compass.  But \xe2\x80\x9ca statute must be read in [its] context.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7 (quoting Davis v. Michigan Dept. of Treasury, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 803, \n809 (1989)\n).  Section 906 does not address whether the LHWCA, as a general matter, \xe2\x80\x9cawards\xe2\x80\x9d disability ben- efits to injured longshore workers.  Rather, it concerns a more specific question: when has a particular employee been \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  In that context, equating \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cstatutorily entitled to compensation\xe2\x80\x9d is not plausible.  A person covered by the Act would not likely say he was \xe2\x80\x9cawarded com- pensation\xe2\x80\x9d the moment he became disabled, if, in fact, his employer contests liability.  Only after some entity\xe2\x80\x94the employer, an ALJ, the BRB, or a reviewing court\xe2\x80\x94recognizes the employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to compensation would he comprehend that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cawarded compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  To borrow The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s example: No person who slips and injures herself on a negligently maintained sidewalk would tell her friends the next day, \xe2\x80\x9cGuess what, I was newly awarded money damages yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe inconsistency between the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d and my reading of the phrase is best illustrated by contextual example.  Assume an employee is injured in 2002 and the employer refuses to pay compensation voluntarily.  Then, five years later, an ALJ finds in favor of the employee and orders the employer to pay benefits to the employee.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the employee was \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in 2002, even though the employee did not receive a penny\xe2\x80\x94and the employer was not obligated to pay a penny\xe2\x80\x94until 2007.  Only the most strained interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded\xe2\x80\x9d could demand that result.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, moreover, does not fit the Act\xe2\x80\x99s design.  As explained supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933, the Act envisions that an eligible employee will begin receiving benefits in either of two ways.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation disregards this design, assuming instead that all employees are awarded benefits in the same way: by the Act at the time they become disabled.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSection 906(c)\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history further confirms that Congress intended \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d to have its commonsense meaning.  In describing \xc2\xa7906, the Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare reported:\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[Section 906(c)] states that determinations of national average weekly wage made with respect to a [fiscal year] apply to employees or survivors currently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits, as well as those who begin receiving compensation for the first time during the [fiscal year].\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x931125, p.\xc2\xa018 (1972) (emphasis added).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tCongress therefore believed an injured worker is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d in the year in which she \xe2\x80\x9cbegin[s] receiving compensation for the first time.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Again, an employee begins receiving compensation either when an employer voluntarily agrees to pay the employee benefits or when an ALJ, the BRB, or a court orders the employer to do so.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  When the employer resists payment, the employee will not necessarily begin receiving compensation in the year in which she becomes disabled.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d to mean awarded through an employer\xe2\x80\x99s voluntary decision or an official order is consistent with the Act\xe2\x80\x99s goal of encouraging employers to pay legitimate claims promptly.  See \n33 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7914(a) (requiring employers to pay compensation \xe2\x80\x9cperiodically, promptly, and directly\xe2\x80\x9d); Estate of Cowart v. Nicklos Drilling Co., \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 469, \n498 (1992)\n (Blackmun, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Act presumes that em- ployers, as a rule, will promptly recognize their LHWCA obligations and commence payments immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under my interpretation, an employer who chooses to contest a valid claim, rather than to pay the claim voluntarily, runs the risk that it may ultimately have to pay the injured employee a higher maximum benefit.  For example, if an employer refuses to pay benefits to a worker injured in 2012, and an ALJ issues an order awarding compensation to the employee in 2015, the fiscal year 2015 maximum rate would apply to the employee\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Had the employer voluntarily begun paying benefits in 2012, on the other hand, the 2012 maximum rate would apply.  Under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, by contrast, an employer pays the prevailing rate for the year the employee became disabled, regardless of whether the employer in fact pays benefits immediately or years down the road.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, Roberts was injured on February 24, 2002 and stopped working two weeks later.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4.  Sea-Land and its insurer paid benefits to Roberts from March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003.  Id., at 101.  Sea-Land then resumed paying benefits on September 1, 2003 and continued to pay Roberts compensation until May 17, 2005, when it ceased making payments for good.  Ibid.  After Roberts filed a complaint with the OWCP, an ALJ, in October 2006, concluded that Roberts was entitled to compensation from March 11, 2002 onwards.  Id., at 107\xe2\x80\x93108.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplying my interpretation of \xc2\xa7906, Roberts was newly awarded compensation three times: in March 2002 when Sea-Land voluntarily began paying benefits; in September 2003 when Sea-Land resumed making payments after it had stopped in July 2003; and in October 2006 when an ALJ ordered Sea-Land to pay benefits to Roberts for the uncompensated weeks in 2003 and from May 2005 onwards.  Roberts was therefore entitled to the fiscal year 2002 maximum rate from March 11, 2002 until July 15, 2003; the fiscal year 2003 maximum rate from September 1, 2003 until May 17, 2005; and the fiscal year 2007 rate\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t going forward and for all uncompensated weeks covered by the ALJ\xe2\x80\x99s order.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment and hold that an employee is \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation\xe2\x80\x9d when her employer either voluntarily agrees to pay compensation to her or is officially ordered to do so.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, the maximum rate for a given fiscal year applies to two groups of injured workers: those who are \xe2\x80\x9cnewly awarded compensation during such [year],\xe2\x80\x9d and those who are \xe2\x80\x9ccurrently receiving compensation for permanent total disability or death benefits during such [year].\xe2\x80\x9d  \n.

The prospect that an employer could successfully execute, or would even attempt, such a strategy is imaginary.  Employers who make voluntary payments to employees are required to file a report with the Department of Labor describing the nature of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s injury and stating the amount of the payments made.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310; \n.  The employer must also submit the results ofa medical evaluation of the employee\xe2\x80\x99s condition.  Dept. of Labor, Longshore (DLHWC) Procedure Manual \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93201(2)(b) (hereinafter Long-shore Procedure Manual), online at http://www.dol.gov/owcp/dlhwc/lspm/lspm2-201.htm (as visited Mar.\xc2\xa014, 2012, and in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Upon receiving the employer\xe2\x80\x99s report, a DOL claims examiner verifies \xe2\x80\x9cthe compensation rate for accuracy\xe2\x80\x9d and must follow-up with the employer \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f the compensation rate appears low.\xe2\x80\x9d  Longshore Procedure Manual \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93201(3)(b)(1).  The chances are slim that a claims examiner would validate a substantial underpayment.  Employers who underpay benefits, moreover, are subject to a penalty equal to 10% of the amount of the underpayment.  See \n; Longshore Procedure Manual \xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x93202(3)(c) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf partial payments are made by the employer, the [10% penalty] appl[ies] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the difference between the amount owed and the amount paid.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Employers would thus risk paying more, not less, were they to attempt to \xe2\x80\x9ccircumven[t]\xe2\x80\x9d my approach by deliberately undercompensating injured workers.  And while it is true that an employer who controverts an employee\xe2\x80\x99s right to compensation does not have to pay the 10% penalty, see ante, at 10, n.\xc2\xa06, the Act does not permit an employer to pay any amount it likes and controvert the remainder.
