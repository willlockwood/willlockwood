S. 325</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>We are called upon to decide in this case whether a State may restrict an Indian Tribe\'s regulation of hunting and fishing on its reservation.  With extensive federal assistance and supervision, the Mescalero Apache Tribe has established a comprehensive scheme for managing the reservation\'s fish and wildlife resources.  Federally approved tribal ordinances regulate in detail the conditions under which both members of the Tribe and nonmembers may hunt and fish.  New Mexico seeks to apply its own laws to hunting and fishing by nonmembers on the reservation.  We hold that this application of New Mexico\'s hunting and fishing laws is preempted by the operation of federal law.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Mescalero Apache Tribe (Tribe) resides on a reservation located within Otero County in south central New Mexico.  The reservation, which represents only a small portion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 462 U. S. 326</a></p><p> of the aboriginal Mescalero domain, was created by a succession of Executive Orders promulgated in the 1870\'s and 1880\'s. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The present reservation comprises more than 460,000 acres, of which the Tribe owns all but 193.85 acres. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Approximately 2,000 members of the Tribe reside on the reservation, along with 179 non-Indians, including resident federal employees of the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Health Service.</p>\n<p>The Tribe is organized under the Indian Reorganization Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 984, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 461 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. V), which authorizes any tribe residing on a reservation to adopt a constitution and bylaws, subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior (Secretary).  The Tribe\'s Constitution, which was approved by the Secretary on January 12, 1965, requires the Tribal Council</p>\n<p>"[t]o protect and preserve the property, wildlife and natural resources of the tribe, and to regulate the conduct of trade and the use and disposition of tribal property upon the reservation, providing that any ordinance directly affecting non-members of the tribe shall be subject to review by the Secretary of [the] Interior."</p>\n<p>App. 53a.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 462 U. S. 327</a></p><p> The Constitution further provides that the Council shall</p>\n<p>"adopt and approve plans of operation to govern the conduct of any business or industry that will further the economic wellbeing of the members of the tribe, and to undertake any activity of any nature whatsoever, not inconsistent with Federal law or with this constitution, designed for the social or economic improvement of the Mescalero Apache people, . . . subject to review by the Secretary of the Interior."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>Anticipating a decline in the sale of lumber which has been the largest income-producing activity within the reservation, the Tribe has recently committed substantial time and resources to the development of other sources of income.  The Tribe has constructed a resort complex financed principally by federal funds, [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and has undertaken a substantial development of the reservation\'s hunting and fishing resources.  These efforts provide employment opportunities for members of the Tribe, and the sale of hunting and fishing licenses and related services generates income which is used to maintain the tribal government and provide services to Tribe members. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>Development of the reservation\'s fish and wildlife resources has involved a sustained, cooperative effort by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 462 U. S. 328</a></p><p> Tribe and the Federal Government.  Indeed, the reservation\'s fishing resources are wholly attributable to these recent efforts.  Using federal funds, the Tribe has established eight artificial lakes which, together with the reservation\'s streams, are stocked by the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, Department of the Interior, which operates a federal hatchery located on the reservation.  None of the waters are stocked by the State. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The United States has also contributed substantially to the creation of the reservation\'s game resources.  Prior to 1966, there were only 13 elk in the vicinity of the reservation.  In 1966 and 1967, the National Park Service donated a herd of 162 elk which was released on the reservation.  Through its management and range development, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] the Tribe has dramatically increased the elk population, which by 1977 numbered approximately 1,200.  New Mexico has not contributed significantly to the development of the elk herd or the other game on the reservation, which includes antelope, bear, and deer. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The Tribe and the Federal Government jointly conduct a comprehensive fish and game management program. Pursuant to its Constitution and to an agreement with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] the Tribal Council adopts hunting and fishing ordinances each year.  The tribal ordinances, which establish bag limits and seasons and provide </p><p><a class="page-number" name="329">Page 462 U. S. 329</a></p><p> for licensing of hunting and fishing, are subject to approval by the Secretary under the Tribal Constitution, and have been so approved.  The Tribal Council adopts the game ordinances on the basis of recommendations submitted by a Bureau of Indian Affairs\' range conservationist, who is assisted by full-time conservation officers employed by the Tribe.  The recommendations are made in light of the conservation needs of the reservation, which are determined on the basis of annual game counts and surveys.  Through the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the Secretary also determines the stocking of the reservation\'s waters based upon periodic surveys of the reservation.</p>\n<p>Numerous conflicts exist between state and tribal hunting regulations. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  For instance, tribal seasons and bag limits for both hunting and fishing often do not coincide with those imposed by the State.  The Tribe permits a hunter to kill both a buck and a doe; the State permits only buck to be killed.  Unlike the State, the Tribe permits a person to purchase an elk license in two consecutive years.  Moreover, since 1977, the Tribe\'s ordinances have specified that state hunting and fishing licenses are not required for Indians or non-Indians who hunt or fish on the reservation. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The New Mexico Department of Game and Fish has enforced the State\'s regulations by arresting non-Indian hunters for illegal possession of game killed on the reservation in accordance with tribal ordinances but not in accordance with state hunting regulations.</p>\n<p>In 1977, the Tribe filed suit against the State and the Director of its Game and Fish Department in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico, seeking to prevent the State from regulating on-reservation hunting or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="330">Page 462 U. S. 330</a></p><p> fishing by members or nonmembers.  On August 2, 1978, the District Court ruled in favor of the Tribe and granted declaratory and injunctive relief against the enforcement of the State\'s hunting and fishing laws against any person for hunting and fishing activities conducted on the reservation.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed.  630 F.2d 724 (1980).  Following New Mexico\'s petition for a writ of certiorari, this Court vacated the Tenth Circuit\'s judgment, 450 U.S. 1036 (1981), and remanded the case for reconsideration in light of <em>Montana v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html">450 U. S. 544</a></span> (1981).  On remand, the Court of Appeals adhered to its earlier decision.  677 F.2d 55 (1982).  We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 1014 (1982), and we now affirm.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>New Mexico concedes that, on the reservation, the Tribe exercises exclusive jurisdiction over hunting and fishing by members of the Tribe, and may also regulate the hunting and fishing by nonmembers. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  New Mexico contends, however, that it may exercise concurrent jurisdiction over nonmembers, and that therefore its regulations governing hunting and fishing throughout the State should also apply to hunting and fishing by nonmembers on the reservation.  Although New Mexico does not claim that it can require the Tribe to permit nonmembers to hunt and fish on the reservation, it claims that, once the Tribe chooses to permit hunting and fishing by nonmembers, such hunting and fishing is subject to any state-imposed conditions.  Under this view, the State would be free to impose conditions more restrictive than the Tribe\'s own regulations, including an outright prohibition.  The question in this case is whether the State may so restrict the Tribe\'s exercise of its authority.</p>\n<p>Our decision in <em>Montana v. United States, supra,</em> does not resolve this question.  Unlike this case, <em>Montana</em> concerned lands located within the reservation but <em>not</em> owned by the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="331">Page 462 U. S. 331</a></p><p> Tribe or its members.  We held that the Crow Tribe could not, as a general matter, regulate hunting and fishing on those lands.  450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html#557">450 U. S. 557</a></span>-567. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  But as to "land belonging to the Tribe or held by the United States in trust for the Tribe," we "readily agree[d]" that a Tribe may "prohibit nonmembers from hunting or fishing . . . [or] condition their entry by charging a fee or establish bag and creel limits."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html#557">450 U. S. 557</a></span>.  We had no occasion to decide whether a Tribe may only exercise this authority in a manner permitted by a State.</p>\n<p>On numerous occasions, this Court has considered the question whether a State may assert authority over a reservation.  The decision in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html">Worcester v. Georgia,</a></span></em> 6 Pet. 515,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/31/515/case.html#560">31 U. S. 560</a></span> (1832), reflected the view that Indian tribes were wholly distinct nations within whose boundaries "the laws of [a State] can have no force."  We long ago departed from the "conceptual clarity of Mr. Chief Justice Marshall\'s view in <em>Worcester,</em>" <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/case.html">411 U. S. 145</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/case.html#148">411 U. S. 148</a></span> (1973), and have acknowledged certain limitations on tribal sovereignty.  For instance, we have held that Indian tribes have been implicitly divested of their sovereignty in certain respects by virtue of their dependent status, [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] that, under certain circumstances, a State may validly assert authority over the activities of nonmembers on a reservation, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] and that, in exceptional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="332">Page 462 U. S. 332</a></p><p> circumstances, a State may assert jurisdiction over the on-reservation activities of tribal members. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, in demarcating the respective spheres of state and tribal authority over Indian reservations, we have continued to stress that Indian tribes are unique aggregations possessing "<em>attributes of sovereignty over both their members and their territory,\'" <em>White Mountain Apache Tribe v. Bracker,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html">448 U. S. 136</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#142">448 U. S. 142</a></span> (1980), quoting <em>United States v.

Because of their sovereign status, tribes and their reservation lands are insulated in some respects by a "historic immunity from state and local control," <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe v. Jones, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/case.html#152">411 U. S. 152</a></span>, and tribes retain any aspect of their historical sovereignty not "inconsistent with the overriding interests of the National Government."  <em>Washington v.

A tribe\'s power to prescribe the conduct of tribal members has never been doubted, and our cases establish that, "<em>absent governing Acts of Congress,\'" a State may not act in a manner that "`infringe[s] on the right of reservation Indians to make their own laws and be ruled by them.\'"  <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/164/case.html">McClanahan v.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/544/case.html">450 U. S. 544</a></span> (1981); <em>Merrion v.

Whether a State may also assert its authority over the on-reservation activities of nonmembers raises "[m]ore difficult questions," <em>Bracker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#144">448 U. S. 144</a></span>.  While under some circumstances a State may exercise concurrent jurisdiction over non-Indians acting on tribal reservations, <em>see, e.g., Washington v. Confederated Tribes, supra; Moe v. Salish &amp; Kootenai Tribes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U.

Bureau of Revenue of New Mexico,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html">458 U. S. 832</a></span> (1982); <em>Bracker, supra; Central Machinery Co. v.

We stated that that determination does not depend</p>\n<p>"on mechanical or absolute conceptions of state or tribal sovereignty, but call[s] for a particularized inquiry into the nature of the state, federal, and tribal interests at stake."</p>\n<p>448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#145">448 U. S. 145</a></span>. We also emphasized the special sense in which the doctrine of preemption is applied in this context.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#143">448 U. S. 143</a></span>-144; <em>Ramah Navajo School Bd., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/832/case.html#838">458 U. S. 838</a></span>.  Although a State will certainly be without jurisdiction if its authority </p><p><a class="page-number" name="334">Page 462 U. S. 334</a></p><p> is preempted under familiar principles of preemption, we cautioned that our prior cases did not limit preemption of state laws affecting Indian tribes to only those circumstances.  "The unique historical origins of tribal sovereignty" and the federal commitment to tribal self-sufficiency and self-determination make it "treacherous to import . . . notions of preemption that are properly applied to . . . other [contexts]."  <em>Bracker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#143">448 U.

By resting preemption analysis principally on a consideration of the nature of the competing interests at stake, our cases have rejected a narrow focus on congressional intent to preempt state law as the sole touchstone.  They have also rejected the proposition that preemption requires "<em>an express congressional statement to that effect.\'"  <em>Bracker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/45/131/case.html#144">45 U.

State jurisdiction is preempted by the operation of federal law if it interferes or is incompatible with federal and tribal interests reflected in federal law, unless the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority.  <em>Bracker, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#145">448 U.

S. 330</a></span>, and as conceded by New Mexico, [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>] the sovereignty retained by the Tribe under the Treaty of 1852 includes its right to regulate the use of its resources by members as well as nonmembers.  In <em>Montana v. United States,</em> we specifically recognized that tribes in general retain this authority.</p>\n<p>Moreover, this aspect of tribal sovereignty has been expressly confirmed by numerous federal statutes. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Pub.L. 280 specifically confirms the power of tribes to regulate on-reservation hunting and fishing.  67 Stat. 588, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1162(b); <em>see also</em> 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1321(b).

The 1981 Amendments to the Lacey Act, 16 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3371 <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed., Supp. V), further accord tribal hunting and fishing regulations the force of federal law by making it a federal offense</p>\n<p>"to import, export, transport, sell, receive, acquire, or purchase any fish or wildlife . . . taken or possessed in violation of any . . . Indian tribal law."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 3372(a)(1). [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Several considerations strongly support the Court of Appeals\' conclusion that the Tribe\'s authority to regulate hunting and fishing preempts state jurisdiction.  It is important to emphasize that concurrent jurisdiction would effectively nullify the Tribe\'s authority to control hunting and fishing on the reservation.  Concurrent jurisdiction would empower New Mexico wholly to supplant tribal regulations.  The State would be able to dictate the terms on which nonmembers are permitted to utilize the reservation\'s resources.  The Tribe would thus exercise its authority over the reservation only at the sufferance of the State.  The tribal authority to regulate hunting and fishing by nonmembers, which has been repeatedly confirmed by federal treaties and laws and which we explicitly recognized in <em>Montana v. United States, supra,</em> would have a rather hollow ring if tribal authority amounted to no more than this.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the exercise of concurrent state jurisdiction in this case would completely "disturb and disarrange," <em>Warren Trading Post Co. v. Arizona Tax Comm\'n, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/380/685/case.html#691">380 U. S. 691</a></span>, the comprehensive scheme of federal and tribal management established pursuant to federal law.  As described </p><p><a class="page-number" name="339">Page 462 U. S. 339</a></p><p> <em>supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/324/case.html#326">462 U. S. 326</a></span>, federal law requires the Secretary to review each of the Tribe\'s hunting and fishing ordinances.  Those ordinances are based on the recommendations made by a federal range conservationist employed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  Moreover, the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife stocks the reservation\'s waters based on its own determinations concerning the availability of fish, biological requirements, and the fishing pressure created by on-reservation fishing.  App. 71a. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]</p>\n<p>Concurrent state jurisdiction would supplant this regulatory scheme with an inconsistent dual system:  members would be governed by tribal ordinances, while nonmembers would be regulated by general state hunting and fishing laws.  This could severely hinder the ability of the Tribe to conduct a sound management program.  Tribal ordinances reflect the specific needs of the reservation by establishing the optimal level of hunting and fishing that should occur, not simply a maximum level that should not be exceeded.  State laws, in contrast, are based on considerations not necessarily relevant to, and possibly hostile to, the needs of the reservation.  For instance, the ordinance permitting a hunter to kill a buck and a doe was designed to curb excessive growth of the deer population on the reservation.  <em>Id.</em> at 153a-154a.  Enforcement of the state regulation permitting only buck to be killed would frustrate that objective.  Similarly, by determining the tribal hunting seasons, bag limits, and permit availability, the Tribe regulates the duration and intensity of hunting.  These determinations take into account numerous factors, including the game capacity of the terrain, the range utilization of the game animals, and the availability of tribal personnel to monitor the hunts.  Permitting the State to enforce different restrictions simply because they have been determined to be appropriate for the State as a whole would impose on the Tribe the possibly insurmountable task of ensuring that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="340">Page 462 U. S. 340</a></p><p> patchwork application of state and tribal regulations remains consistent with sound management of the reservation\'s resources.</p>\n<p>Federal law commits to the Secretary and the Tribal Council the responsibility to manage the reservation\'s resources.  It is most unlikely that Congress would have authorized, and the Secretary would have established, financed, and participated in, tribal management if it were thought that New Mexico was free to nullify the entire arrangement. [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>]  Requiring tribal ordinances to yield whenever state law is more restrictive would seriously "undermine the Secretary\'s [and the Tribe\'s] ability to make the wide range of determinations committed to [their] authority."  <em>Bracker,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/136/case.html#149">448 U.

The Tribe has engaged in a concerted and sustained undertaking to develop and manage the reservation\'s wildlife and land resources specifically for the benefit of its members.  The project generates funds for essential tribal services and provides employment for members who reside on the reservation.  This case is thus far removed from those situations, such as on-reservation sales outlets which market to nonmembers goods not manufactured by the tribe or its members, in which the tribal contribution to an enterprise is <em>de minimis.</em> <em>See Washington v.

Some species of game never leave tribal lands, and the State points to no specific interest concerning those that occasionally do.  Unlike <em>Puyallup Tribe v.
