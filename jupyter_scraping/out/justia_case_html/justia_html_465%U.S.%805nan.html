When a routine audit by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine the corporation\'s income tax liability for certain years revealed that the corporation had made questionable payments from a "special disbursement account," the IRS instituted a criminal investigation of the corporation\'s tax returns.

S. 808</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>Respondent Arthur Young &amp; Co. is a firm of certified public accountants.  As the independent auditor for respondent Amerada Hess Corp., Young is responsible for reviewing the financial statements prepared by Amerada as required by the federal securities laws. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In the course of its review of these financial statements, Young verified Amerada\'s statement of its contingent tax liabilities, and, in so doing, prepared the tax accrual workpapers at issue in this case.  Tax accrual workpapers are documents and memoranda relating to Young\'s evaluation of Amerada\'s reserves for contingent tax liabilities.  Such workpapers sometimes contain information pertaining to Amerada\'s financial transactions, identify questionable positions Amerada may have taken on its tax returns, and reflect Young\'s opinions regarding the validity of such positions.  <em>See infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/805/case.html#810">465 U. S. 810</a></span>-813.</p>\n<p>In 1975, the Internal Revenue Service began a routine audit to determine Amerada\'s corporate income tax liability for the tax years 1972 through 1974.  When the audit revealed that Amerada had made questionable payments of $7,830 from a "special disbursement account," the IRS instituted a criminal investigation of Amerada\'s tax returns as well.  In that process, pursuant to Code \xc2\xa7 7602, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7602, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] the IRS </p><p><a class="page-number" name="809">Page 465 U. S. 809</a></p><p> issued an administrative summons to Young, which required Young to make available to the IRS all its Amerada files, including its tax accrual workpapers.  Amerada instructed Young not to comply with the summons.</p>\n<p>The IRS then commenced this enforcement action against Young in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  <em>See</em> 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7604. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Amerada intervened, as permitted by 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7609(b)(1). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The District Court found that Young\'s tax accrual workpapers were relevant to the IRS investigation within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 7602, and refused to recognize an accountant-client privilege that would protect the workpapers.  496 F.Supp. 1152, 1156-1157 (1980).  Accordingly, the District Court ordered the summons enforced.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>A divided United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed in part and reversed in part.  677 F.2d 211 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="810">Page 465 U. S. 810</a></p><p> (1982).  The Court of Appeals majority agreed with the District Court that the tax accrual workpapers were relevant to the IRS investigation of Amerada, but held that the public interest in promoting full disclosure to public accountants, and in turn ensuring the integrity of the securities markets, required protection for the work that such independent auditors perform for publicly owned companies.  Drawing upon <em>Hickman v. Taylor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/495/case.html">329 U. S. 495</a></span> (1947), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(b)(3), the Court of Appeals fashioned a work-product immunity doctrine for tax accrual workpapers prepared by independent auditors in the course of compliance with the federal securities laws.  Because the IRS had not demonstrated a sufficient showing of need to overcome the immunity and was not seeking to prove fraud on Amerada\'s part, the Court of Appeals refused to enforce the summons insofar as it sought Young\'s tax accrual workpapers.</p>\n<p>One judge dissented from that portion of the majority opinion creating a work-product immunity for accountants\' tax accrual workpapers.  The dissent viewed the statutory summons authority, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7602, as reflecting a congressional decision in favor of the disclosure of such workpapers.  The dissent also rejected the policy justifications asserted by the majority for an accountant work-product immunity, reasoning that such protection was not necessary to ensure the integrity of the independent auditor\'s certification of a corporation\'s financial statements.</p>\n<p>We granted certiorari, 459 U.S. 1199 (1983).  We affirm in part and reverse in part.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Corporate financial statements are one of the primary sources of information available to guide the decisions of the investing public.  In an effort to control the accuracy of the financial data available to investors in the securities markets, various provisions of the federal securities laws require </p><p><a class="page-number" name="811">Page 465 U. S. 811</a></p><p> publicly held corporations to file their financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Commission regulations stipulate that these financial reports must be audited by an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  By examining the corporation\'s books and records, the independent auditor determines whether the financial reports of the corporation have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  The auditor then issues an opinion as to whether the financial statements, taken as a whole, fairly present the financial position and operations of the corporation for the relevant period. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  <em>See</em> <a href="#F13" name="T13">n</a> 13, <em>infra.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="812">Page 465 U. S. 812</a></p><p></p>\n<p>An important aspect of the auditor\'s function is to evaluate the adequacy and reasonableness of the corporation\'s reserve account for contingent tax liabilities.  This reserve account, known as the tax accrual account, the noncurrent tax account, or the tax pool, represents the amount set aside by the corporation to cover adjustments and additions to the corporation\'s actual tax liability.  Additional corporate tax liability may arise from a wide variety of transactions. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The presence of a reserve account for such contingent tax liabilities reflects the corporation\'s awareness of, and preparedness for, the possibility of an assessment of additional taxes.</p>\n<p>The independent auditor draws upon many sources in evaluating the sufficiency of the corporation\'s tax accrual account.  Initially, the corporation\'s books, records, and tax returns must be analyzed in light of the relevant Code provisions, Treasury Regulations, Revenue Rulings, and case law.  The auditor will also obtain and assess the opinions, speculations, and projections of management with regard to unclear, aggressive, or questionable tax positions that may have been taken on prior tax returns.  In exploring the tax consequences of certain transactions, the auditor often engages in a "worst-case" analysis in order to ensure that the tax accrual account accurately reflects the full extent of the corporation\'s exposure to additional tax liability.  From this conglomeration of data, the auditor is able to estimate the potential cost of each particular contingency, as well as the probability that the additional liability may arise.</p>\n<p>The auditor\'s tax accrual workpapers record this process of examination and analysis.  Such workpapers may document the auditor\'s interviews with corporate personnel, judgments on questions of potential tax liability, and suggestions for alternative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="813">Page 465 U. S. 813</a></p><p> treatments of certain transactions for tax purposes.  Tax accrual workpapers also contain an overall evaluation of the sufficiency of the corporation\'s reserve for contingent tax liabilities, including an item-by-item analysis of the corporation\'s potential exposure to additional liability.  In short, tax accrual workpapers pinpoint the "soft spots" on a corporation\'s tax return by highlighting those areas in which the corporate taxpayer has taken a position that may, at some later date, require the payment of additional taxes.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>In seeking access to Young\'s tax accrual workpapers, the IRS exercised the summons power conferred by Code \xc2\xa7 7602, 26 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 7602, which authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to summon and "examine any books, papers, records, or other data which may be relevant or material" to a particular tax inquiry. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The District Court and the Court of Appeals determined that the tax accrual workpapers at issue in this case satisfied the relevance requirement of \xc2\xa7 7602, because they "might have thrown light upon" the correctness of Amerada\'s tax return. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Because the relevance </p><p><a class="page-number" name="814">Page 465 U. S. 814</a></p><p> of tax accrual workpapers is a logical predicate to the question whether such workpapers should be protected by some form of work-product immunity, we turn first to an evaluation of the relevance issue. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We agree that such workpapers are relevant within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 7602.</p>\n<p>As the language of \xc2\xa7 7602 clearly indicates, an IRS summons is not to be judged by the relevance standards used in deciding whether to admit evidence in federal court.  <em>Cf.</em> Fed.Rule Evid. 401.  The language "may be" reflects Congress\' express intention to allow the IRS to obtain items of even <em>potential</em> relevance to an ongoing investigation, without reference to its admissibility.  The purpose of Congress is obvious:  the Service can hardly be expected to know whether such data will, in fact, be relevant until they are procured and scrutinized.  As a tool of discovery, the \xc2\xa7 7602 summons is critical to the investigative and enforcement functions of the IRS, <em>see United State v. Powell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/48/case.html">379 U. S. 48</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/379/48/case.html#57">379 U. S. 57</a></span> (1964); the Service therefore should not be required to establish that the documents it seeks are actually relevant in any technical, evidentiary sense. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="815">Page 465 U. S. 815</a></p><p></p>\n<p>That tax accrual workpapers are not actually used in the preparation of tax returns by the taxpayer or its own accountants does not bar a finding of relevance within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 7602.  The filing of a corporate tax return entails much more than filling in the blanks on an IRS form in accordance with undisputed tax principles; more likely than not, the return is a composite interpretation of corporate transactions made by corporate officers in the light most favorable to the taxpayer.  It is the responsibility of the IRS to determine whether the corporate taxpayer, in completing its return, has stretched a particular tax concept beyond what is allowed.  Records that illuminate any aspect of the return -- such as the tax accrual workpapers at issue in this case -- are therefore highly relevant to legitimate IRS inquiry.  The Court of Appeals acknowledged this:</p>\n<p>"It is difficult to say that the assessment by the independent auditor of the correctness of positions taken by the taxpayer in his return would not throw \'light upon\' the correctness of the return."</p>\n<p>677 F.2d at 219.  We accordingly affirm the Court of Appeals\' holding that Young\'s tax accrual workpapers are relevant to the IRS investigation of Amerada\'s tax liability.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>We now turn to consider whether tax accrual workpapers prepared by an independent auditor in the course of a routine review of corporate financial statements should be protected by some form of work-product immunity from disclosure under \xc2\xa7 7602.  Based upon its evaluation of the competing policies of the federal tax and securities laws, the Court of Appeals found it necessary to create a so-called privilege for the independent auditor\'s workpapers.</p>\n<p>Our complex and comprehensive system of federal taxation, relying as it does upon self-assessment and reporting, demands that all taxpayers be forthright in the disclosure of relevant information to the taxing authorities.  Without such </p><p><a class="page-number" name="816">Page 465 U. S. 816</a></p><p> disclosure, and the concomitant power of the Government to compel disclosure, our national tax burden would not be fairly and equitably distributed.  In order to encourage effective tax investigations, Congress has endowed the IRS with expansive information-gathering authority; \xc2\xa7 7602 is the centerpiece of that congressional design.

We are unable to discern the sort of "unambiguous directions from Congress" that would justify a judicially created work-product immunity for tax accrual workpapers summoned under \xc2\xa7 7602.  Indeed, the very language of \xc2\xa7 7602 reflects precisely the opposite:  a congressional policy choice <em>in favor of disclosure</em> of all information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry.  In light of this explicit statement by the Legislative Branch, courts should be chary in recognizing exceptions to the broad summons authority of the IRS or in fashioning new privileges that would curtail disclosure under </p><p><a class="page-number" name="817">Page 465 U. S. 817</a></p><p> \xc2\xa7 7602.  <em>Cf. Milwaukee v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/451/304/case.html">451 U.

If the broad latitude granted to the IRS by \xc2\xa7 7602 is to be circumscribed, that is a choice for Congress, and not this Court, to make.  <em>See United States v. Euge,</em> 444 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/444/707/case.html#712">444 U.

S. 711</a></span>, required the fashioning of a work-product immunity for an independent auditor\'s tax accrual workpapers.  To the extent that the Court of Appeals, in its concern for the "chilling effect" of the disclosure of tax accrual workpapers, sought to facilitate communication between independent auditors and their clients, its remedy more closely resembles a testimonial accountant-client privilege than a work-product immunity for accountants\' workpapers.  But as this Court stated in <em>Couch v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html">409 U. S. 322</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/322/case.html#335">409 U. S. 335</a></span> (1973),</p>\n<p>"no confidential accountant-client privilege exists under federal law, and no state-created privilege has been recognized in federal cases."</p>\n<p>In light of Couch, the Court of Appeals\' effort to foster candid communication between accountant and client by creating a self-styled work-product privilege was misplaced, and conflicts with what we see as the clear intent of Congress.</p>\n<p>Nor do we find persuasive the argument that a work-product immunity for accountants\' tax accrual workpapers is a fitting analogue to the attorney work-product doctrine established in <em>Hickman v. Taylor,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/495/case.html">329 U. S. 495</a></span> (1947).  The <em>Hickman</em> work-product doctrine was founded upon the private attorney\'s role as the client\'s confidential adviser and advocate, a loyal representative whose duty it is to present the client\'s case in the most favorable possible light.  An independent certified public accountant performs a different role.  By certifying the public reports that collectively depict a corporation\'s financial status, the independent auditor assumes a <em>public</em> responsibility transcending any employment relationship with the client.  The independent public accountant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="818">Page 465 U. S. 818</a></p><p> performing this special function owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation\'s creditors and stockholders, as well as to the investing public.  This "public watchdog" function demands that the accountant maintain total independence from the client at all times, and requires complete fidelity to the public trust.  To insulate from disclosure a certified public accountant\'s interpretations of the client\'s financial statements would be to ignore the significance of the accountant\'s role as a disinterested analyst charged with public obligations.</p>\n<p>We cannot accept the view that the integrity of the securities markets will suffer absent some protection for accountants\' tax accrual workpapers.  The Court of Appeals apparently feared that, were the IRS to have access to tax accrual workpapers, a corporation might be tempted to withhold from its auditor certain information relevant and material to a proper evaluation of its financial statements.  But the independent certified public accountant cannot be content with the corporation\'s representations that its tax accrual reserves are adequate; the auditor is ethically and professionally obligated to ascertain for himself, as far as possible, whether the corporation\'s contingent tax liabilities have been accurately stated.  If the auditor were convinced that the scope of the examination had been limited by management\'s reluctance to disclose matters relating to the tax accrual reserves, the auditor would be unable to issue an unqualified opinion as to the accuracy of the corporation\'s financial statements.  Instead, the auditor would be required to issue a qualified opinion, an adverse opinion, or a disclaimer of opinion, thereby notifying the investing public of possible potential problems inherent in the corporation\'s financial reports. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="819">Page 465 U. S. 819</a></p><p> Responsible corporate management would not risk a qualified evaluation of a corporate taxpayer\'s financial posture to afford cover for questionable positions reflected in a prior tax return. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Thus, the independent auditor\'s obligation to serve the public interest assures that the integrity of the securities markets will be preserved, without the need for a work-product immunity for accountants\' tax accrual workpapers.

S. 820</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We also reject respondents\' position that fundamental fairness precludes IRS access to accountants\' tax accrual workpapers.  Respondents urge that the enforcement of an IRS summons for accountants\' tax accrual workpapers permits the Government to probe the thought processes of its taxpayer citizens, thereby giving the IRS an unfair advantage in negotiating and litigating tax controversies.  But if the SEC itself, or a private plaintiff in securities litigation, sought to obtain the tax accrual workpapers at issue in this case, they would surely be entitled to do so. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  In light of the broad congressional command of \xc2\xa7 7602, no sound reason exists for conferring lesser authority upon the IRS than upon a private litigant suing with regard to transactions concerning which the public has no interest.</p>\n<p>Congress has granted to the IRS "broad latitude to adopt enforcement techniques helpful in the performance of [its] tax collection and assessment responsibilities."  <em>United States v.

The SEC requires the filing of audited financial statements in order to obviate the fear of loss from reliance on inaccurate information, thereby encouraging public investment in the Nation\'s industries.  It is therefore not enough that financial statements he accurate; the public must also <em>perceive</em> them as being accurate.  Public faith in the reliability of a corporation\'s financial statements depends upon the public perception of the outside auditor as an independent professional.  Endowing the workpapers of an independent auditor with a work-product immunity would destroy the appearance of auditor\'s independence by creating the impression that the auditor is an advocate for the client.
