The Supervisors, 83 U.S. 16 Wall. 452 452 (1872)</h3><p><b>Kenicott v. The Supervisors</b></p><p><b>83 U.S. (26 Wall.) 452</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>1. A legislative act chartering a railroad company and authorizing the construction of a railroad between certain points authorized, by its 7th, 8th; and 9th sections, the company to borrow money and authorized also a county through which the road chiefly ran to issue its bonds and provide for their payment by the sale of its swamp and overflowed lands.  A 10th section proceeded</p>\n<p>"Any county through which said road may run, and every county through which <em>any other railroad may run with which this road may he joined, connected, or intersected, may,</em> and are <em>hereby authorized</em> and <em>empowered to aid in the construction</em> of the <em>same or</em> of <em>such other road</em> with which it may so connect, and for this purpose the provisions of the seventh, eighth and ninth sections of this act shall extend, include, and be applicable to <em>every such</em> county and <em>every such railroad.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Held</em> that this section did not require that the road to be aided should be actually built before a county was authorized to mortgage its lands, but, contrariwise, that the aid was intended to be given before the road was built, and that the counties giving the aid were expected to take the, ordinary risk of the success of the undertaking in which they embarked their property.</p>\n<p>2. Where another company was subsequently chartered to build a road, whose course ran up to one terminus of the road of the company previously chartered and thence onwards completely through another county adjoining the county in which the former road lay, and the railroad company first chartered undertook the construction of the new road from the terminus above mentioned onwards, completely through the other and adjoining counties, <em>held,</em> that the authority to construct the connecting road, and the entering into a contract for its construction, formed a "connection" within the meaning of the above-quoted 10th section.</p>\n<p>3. In a bill to foreclose a mortgage given to secure negotiable railroad bonds with the bonds transferred to a <em>bona fide</em> holder for value, no other or further defense are allowed as against the mortgage than would be allowed were the action brought in a court of law upon the bonds.  <em>Carpenter v. Longan, supra,</em> <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/83/271/case.html">83 U. S. 271</a></span>, affirmed.</p>\n<p>4. The 7th and 10th sections of the Act of the Illinois Legislature of February, 18-i5, chartering the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, authorized </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 83 U. S. 453</a></p><p> (other things permitting) the mortgage of the swamp and overflowed lands of Wayne County, Illinois, by the judges of the county court.</p>\n<p>5. A <em>bonus</em> is not a gift or gratuity, but a sum paid for services, or upon a consideration in addition to or in excess of what would ordinarily be given.</p>\n<p>The Central Railroad of Illinois runs, in a large part of its course, north and south through the state just named.  The great extent of its course, and the important places through which it passes or to which it leads, made it a matter very desirable to the towns in adjoining districts on the east and west of it to connect themselves by other railroads with it.  Among the towns on the east, and about eighteen miles to the east of the road, was Mount Vernon, a place situate in Jefferson County, a county on the east of the road, whose course runs parallel to the whole of the western line of the county.  This town, moving early in the matter, the Legislature of Illinois, in February, 1855, chartered a company, called the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, whose immediate purpose was, with the aid of a mortgage on certain lands in Jefferson County, known as the "swamp and overflowed lands," to build a road from Mount Vernon, in Jefferson County aforesaid, to the Illinois Central.  Such a road, of course, would run west through the western part of Jefferson County, cross its western line, and connect soon after with the desired trunk of the Illinois Central.</p>\n<p>The charter, in its seventh, eighth, and ninth sections, reads thus:</p>\n<p>"SECTION 7.  The corporation may borrow such sums of money as they deem advisable, and upon such terms as they may agree for the carrying out of the objects of this act, and may provide any security therefor they think best, by bond and mortgage, or otherwise."</p>\n<p>"SECTION 8.  The County Court of Jefferson County are hereby authorized and empowered to subscribe for such amount of the capital stock of said company as they may think proper.  They may issue the bonds of the county, and provide for the payment of the principal and interest thereof, by <em>sale</em> or <em>mortgage,</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="454">Page 83 U. S. 454</a></p><p> <em>one or both,</em> of the <em>swamp</em> and <em>overflowed lands</em> of said county, and dispose of such bonds for money to pay, or in payment of their subscription to said stock; all and each to be upon such time, <em>terms,</em> and in such <em>mode</em> as they may <em>deem</em> best, or they may <em>make such other disposition</em> of said swamp and overflowed lands in <em>aid</em> of the <em>construction</em> and maintenance of said railroad as they <em>deem best</em> for the public interest of said county."</p>\n<p>"SECTION 9.  Before any disposition is made of said swamp and overflowed lands or any subscription to the stock of said company, the said county court may, at any regular or special term of said court, order a special election to be held for the purpose of taking the sense of the qualified voters of the county thereupon -- giving such notice thereof as they may deem proper -- and which shall be conducted, and returns made, canvassed, and published in all respects as other county elections.  The County Court shall prepare a proposition or propositions of the mode or modes, one or more, containing a <em>brief, clear, distinct idea of the plan or plans proposed by them for aiding in constructing of said road,</em> which said proposition shall be printed at large as an election ticket, and the voters may express their will on said proposition by writing \'Yea\' and \'Nay\' on a separate ticket.  The proposition or plan having the highest number of votes shall be adopted by the county court."</p>\n<p>But in addition to the sections thus quoted followed another and very important one in these words:</p>\n<p>"SECTION 10.  Any county through which said road <em>may</em> run, and <em>every</em> county through which <em>any other railroad may</em> run with which this road <em>may be joined, connected,</em> or <em>intersected, may,</em> and are hereby <em>authorized</em> and <em>empowered</em> to <em>aid</em> in the <em>construction</em> of the <em>same,</em> or of <em>such other road</em> with which it may so connect; and for this purpose, the provisions of the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections of this act <em>shall extend, include,</em> and be <em>applicable</em> to <em>every</em> such county, and <em>every such</em> railroad."</p>\n<p>So far as to Jefferson County, and this 10th section.</p>\n<p>On the east again of Jefferson County, and, like it, having "swamp and overflowed lands," and like it interested in gaining a connection with the great trunk of the Illinois Central, was Wayne County; the west line of this county being about eleven miles east of the town of Mount Vernon. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 83 U. S. 455</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On the same day of February, 1855, when the charter already mentioned was granted, a charter had been granted to another company, named the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company, whose purpose was the construction of a road from Belleville (a place in Illinois near St. Louis and west of the Illinois Central), through Nashville (Illinois) and Mount Vernon, to Fairfield, a place in Illinois nearly east of Mount Vernon, and so finally to Louisville, Kentucky.  This road, which ran from west to east, was chartered so as to run through both the Counties of Jefferson and Wayne, and by the terms of the 10th section of the Mount Vernon road might "be joined, connected, or intersected" with it.</p>\n<p>This charter to the Belleville &amp; Fairfield road being in existence, the County Court of Wayne County, on the 13th of March, 1856, made a deed of its swamp lands to one Charles Wood, in trust for that company or any other company that would build a railroad through the county.  This deed recited that a connection had been made between the Mount Vernon and the Belleville &amp; Fairfield roads by which the latter would become a part of and elongation of the former; that the power to appropriate the swamp lands in Wayne County through which the said road was situated was brought into operation; that a vote had been taken in November, 1855, to appropriate and donate said lands for the purpose of aiding in constructing the said road, and that this power had been conferred by the 9th section of the charter of the Mount Vernon company, and that in execution of such authority and power, the deed was made by the county court.  The deed contained a proviso that if the road should not be made in a certain time, the land should be reconveyed by Wood to the county.</p>\n<p>An act of the Illinois Legislature, passed February 14, 1857, amendatory of the charter of this Belleville &amp; Fairfield company, and extending its line of transit, changed the name of the company to "The St. Louis &amp; Louisville Railroad Company."  The proposed line of the road as thus enlarged crossed the Illinois Central and was located directly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 83 U. S. 456</a></p><p> through five different counties, of which Wayne was one.  The act declared:</p>\n<p>"SECTION 4.  The vote heretofore taken in Wayne County to donate the swamp lands to the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company &amp;c., and the conveyance of said land by the county court of said county in trust for the use of the said railroad company are, and the same are hereby declared to be legal and valid."</p>\n<p>"SECTION 5.  Each county through which said railroad runs may donate the swamp lands of such county to the St. Louis &amp; Louisville Railroad."</p>\n<p>In this state of things, the County of Wayne held an election in November, 1858, in which the question was thus proposed to the voters:</p>\n<p>"For appropriating the swamp lands of Wayne County as a bonus to any company for building a railroad through said county."</p>\n<p>"Against the same."</p>\n<p>A majority of votes was cast in favor of the proposition, and thereupon soon after this time two persons, named Van Duser and Smith, entered into a contract with Wayne County for building that part of the road of the Belleville &amp; Fairfield company (or, as it now was, the St. Louis &amp; Louisville company) lying between the east line of Wayne County and Mount Vernon, thus running across the entire width of Wayne County.  This contract having been partially executed by Van Duser and Smith was assigned to the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, in which they had become the chief stockholders, and that company undertook the construction of this portion of the road.</p>\n<p>The County of Jefferson entered into a like contract for the construction of the Mount Vernon road, from Mount Vernon to the Illinois Central.</p>\n<p>On the 20th of April, 1859, S. J. Wilson and T. M. Scott, Judges of the County Court of Wayne County, mortgaged the whole, about 100,000 acres, of the swamp and overflowed lands of the county to Isaac Seymour, of New York, in trust </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 83 U. S. 457</a></p><p> to secure the payment of bonds to the amount of $800,000, to be issued by the Mount Vernon Railroad Company.  The recitals of the mortgage ran thus:</p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States duly passed an act, approved September the 28, A.D. 1850, entitled \'An act to enable the State of Arkansas and other states to reclaim the swamp lands within their limits,\' and in pursuance thereof the Secretary of the Interior of the United States caused a patent to be issued to the State of Illinois for all the swamp and overflowed lands within its limits, to be situated under the direction of the Commissioners of the Land Office:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas,</em> The Legislature of the said State of Illinois passed an act, approved by the governor of said state on the 22d of January, A.D. 1852, entitled \'An act to dispose of the swamp and overflowed lands, and to pay the expenses of selecting and surveying the same,\' which said act authorized the appropriation and disposal of said lands for such purposes as may be deemed expedient by the court or county judges:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas</em> the Legislature of the State of Illinois passed an act, approved by the governor of said state on the 15th of February, A.D. 1855, entitled \'An act to incorporate the Mount Vernon Railroad Company,\' whereby all such persons and corporations as shall become stockholders under the provisions of the said act, and their successors, were duly incorporated into a body politic and corporate under the name of the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, and the parties of the first part were duly authorized and empowered to make such disposition of the swamp and overflowed lands within the said County of Wayne, in aid of the construction and maintenance of the said railroad as they deem best for the public interest of said county:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas,</em> at a special term of the said County Court of the County of Wayne, held on the 28th of September, A.D. 1855, an order was duly made and entered by the same court whereby a special election was ordered and directed on the 5th of November, A.D. 1855, to be held for the purpose of taking the sense of the qualified voters of the county upon the mortgaging that portion of the said overflowed and swamp lands hereinafter described for the purpose of aiding in the construction and maintenance of the said the Mount Vernon Railroad; and the said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 83 U.

Both, as appeared by an entry in the records of the county court, were thus recognized in that tribunal.  The entry was thus:</p>\n<p>"<em>APRIL SPECIAL TERM, 1859" </em></p>\n<p>"At a special term of the County Court of Wayne County, began and held at the courthouse in Fairfield, on the 20th day of April, 1859.

These holders of the bonds had paid value for them before their maturity without notice of any defect or infirmity in the bonds or in the mortgage.  The interest being unpaid, they filed a bill in the court below against the Board of Supervisors of Wayne County impleaded with the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, to foreclose the mortgage given as already mentioned by the county just named.</p>\n<p>In its answer, the defendant insisted that the Mount Vernon Railroad Company was not located in, did not run in the County of Wayne, and had no authority or right to run or locate its road through that county.  It was denied that there was any other railroad running through the County of Wayne with which the Mount Vernon road was joined, or connected, or intersected, and it was averred that it did not then connect with any railroad in the County of Wayne.  Proofs were taken and the bill was dismissed upon the ground that the proofs failed to show that at the date of the mortgage and deed of trust for securing the payment of the bonds there was any line of railroad constructed, or authorized to be constructed, through the County of Wayne, with which the Mount Vernon railroad was joined, connected, or intersected.  The plaintiffs thereupon appealed to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 83 U.

Any county through which said road <em>may</em> run, and <em>every</em> county through which <em>any other railroad may</em> run with which this road <em>may be joined, connected,</em> or <em>intersected, may,</em> and are hereby <em>authorized</em> and <em>empowered</em> to <em>aid</em> in the <em>construction</em> of the <em>same,</em> or of <em>such other road</em> with which it may so connect; and for this purpose, the provisions of the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections of this act <em>shall extend, include,</em> and be <em>applicable</em> to <em>every</em> such county, and <em>every such</em> railroad."</p>\n<p>So far as to Jefferson County, and this 10th section.</p>\n<p>On the east again of Jefferson County, and, like it, having "swamp and overflowed lands," and like it interested in gaining a connection with the great trunk of the Illinois Central, was Wayne County; the west line of this county being about eleven miles east of the town of Mount Vernon. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 83 U. S. 455</a></p><p></p>\n<p>On the same day of February, 1855, when the charter already mentioned was granted, a charter had been granted to another company, named the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company, whose purpose was the construction of a road from Belleville (a place in Illinois near St. Louis and west of the Illinois Central), through Nashville (Illinois) and Mount Vernon, to Fairfield, a place in Illinois nearly east of Mount Vernon, and so finally to Louisville, Kentucky.  This road, which ran from west to east, was chartered so as to run through both the Counties of Jefferson and Wayne, and by the terms of the 10th section of the Mount Vernon road might "be joined, connected, or intersected" with it.</p>\n<p>This charter to the Belleville &amp; Fairfield road being in existence, the County Court of Wayne County, on the 13th of March, 1856, made a deed of its swamp lands to one Charles Wood, in trust for that company or any other company that would build a railroad through the county.  This deed recited that a connection had been made between the Mount Vernon and the Belleville &amp; Fairfield roads by which the latter would become a part of and elongation of the former; that the power to appropriate the swamp lands in Wayne County through which the said road was situated was brought into operation; that a vote had been taken in November, 1855, to appropriate and donate said lands for the purpose of aiding in constructing the said road, and that this power had been conferred by the 9th section of the charter of the Mount Vernon company, and that in execution of such authority and power, the deed was made by the county court.  The deed contained a proviso that if the road should not be made in a certain time, the land should be reconveyed by Wood to the county.</p>\n<p>An act of the Illinois Legislature, passed February 14, 1857, amendatory of the charter of this Belleville &amp; Fairfield company, and extending its line of transit, changed the name of the company to "The St. Louis &amp; Louisville Railroad Company."  The proposed line of the road as thus enlarged crossed the Illinois Central and was located directly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 83 U. S. 456</a></p><p> through five different counties, of which Wayne was one.  The act declared:</p>\n<p>"SECTION 4.  The vote heretofore taken in Wayne County to donate the swamp lands to the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company &amp;c., and the conveyance of said land by the county court of said county in trust for the use of the said railroad company are, and the same are hereby declared to be legal and valid."</p>\n<p>"SECTION 5.  Each county through which said railroad runs may donate the swamp lands of such county to the St. Louis &amp; Louisville Railroad."</p>\n<p>In this state of things, the County of Wayne held an election in November, 1858, in which the question was thus proposed to the voters:</p>\n<p>"For appropriating the swamp lands of Wayne County as a bonus to any company for building a railroad through said county."</p>\n<p>"Against the same."</p>\n<p>A majority of votes was cast in favor of the proposition, and thereupon soon after this time two persons, named Van Duser and Smith, entered into a contract with Wayne County for building that part of the road of the Belleville &amp; Fairfield company (or, as it now was, the St. Louis &amp; Louisville company) lying between the east line of Wayne County and Mount Vernon, thus running across the entire width of Wayne County.  This contract having been partially executed by Van Duser and Smith was assigned to the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, in which they had become the chief stockholders, and that company undertook the construction of this portion of the road.</p>\n<p>The County of Jefferson entered into a like contract for the construction of the Mount Vernon road, from Mount Vernon to the Illinois Central.</p>\n<p>On the 20th of April, 1859, S. J. Wilson and T. M. Scott, Judges of the County Court of Wayne County, mortgaged the whole, about 100,000 acres, of the swamp and overflowed lands of the county to Isaac Seymour, of New York, in trust </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 83 U. S. 457</a></p><p> to secure the payment of bonds to the amount of $800,000, to be issued by the Mount Vernon Railroad Company.  The recitals of the mortgage ran thus:</p>\n<p>"WHEREAS, The Congress of the United States duly passed an act, approved September the 28, A.D. 1850, entitled \'An act to enable the State of Arkansas and other states to reclaim the swamp lands within their limits,\' and in pursuance thereof the Secretary of the Interior of the United States caused a patent to be issued to the State of Illinois for all the swamp and overflowed lands within its limits, to be situated under the direction of the Commissioners of the Land Office:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas,</em> The Legislature of the said State of Illinois passed an act, approved by the governor of said state on the 22d of January, A.D. 1852, entitled \'An act to dispose of the swamp and overflowed lands, and to pay the expenses of selecting and surveying the same,\' which said act authorized the appropriation and disposal of said lands for such purposes as may be deemed expedient by the court or county judges:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas</em> the Legislature of the State of Illinois passed an act, approved by the governor of said state on the 15th of February, A.D. 1855, entitled \'An act to incorporate the Mount Vernon Railroad Company,\' whereby all such persons and corporations as shall become stockholders under the provisions of the said act, and their successors, were duly incorporated into a body politic and corporate under the name of the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, and the parties of the first part were duly authorized and empowered to make such disposition of the swamp and overflowed lands within the said County of Wayne, in aid of the construction and maintenance of the said railroad as they deem best for the public interest of said county:"</p>\n<p>"<em>And whereas,</em> at a special term of the said County Court of the County of Wayne, held on the 28th of September, A.D. 1855, an order was duly made and entered by the same court whereby a special election was ordered and directed on the 5th of November, A.D. 1855, to be held for the purpose of taking the sense of the qualified voters of the county upon the mortgaging that portion of the said overflowed and swamp lands hereinafter described for the purpose of aiding in the construction and maintenance of the said the Mount Vernon Railroad; and the said </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 83 U.

Both, as appeared by an entry in the records of the county court, were thus recognized in that tribunal.  The entry was thus:</p>\n<p>"<em>APRIL SPECIAL TERM, 1859" </em></p>\n<p>"At a special term of the County Court of Wayne County, began and held at the courthouse in Fairfield, on the 20th day of April, 1859.

"</p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 83 U. S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Mount Vernon Railroad Company issued the bonds such exactly as were described in the recitals above given of the mortgage, and certain of them (to the extent of $73,000) passed into the hands of one Kenicott and others, citizens of Massachusetts.  These holders of the bonds had paid value for them before their maturity without notice of any defect or infirmity in the bonds or in the mortgage.  The interest being unpaid, they filed a bill in the court below against the Board of Supervisors of Wayne County impleaded with the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, to foreclose the mortgage given as already mentioned by the county just named.</p>\n<p>In its answer, the defendant insisted that the Mount Vernon Railroad Company was not located in, did not run in the County of Wayne, and had no authority or right to run or locate its road through that county.  It was denied that there was any other railroad running through the County of Wayne with which the Mount Vernon road was joined, or connected, or intersected, and it was averred that it did not then connect with any railroad in the County of Wayne.  Proofs were taken and the bill was dismissed upon the ground that the proofs failed to show that at the date of the mortgage and deed of trust for securing the payment of the bonds there was any line of railroad constructed, or authorized to be constructed, through the County of Wayne, with which the Mount Vernon railroad was joined, connected, or intersected.  The plaintiffs thereupon appealed to this Court. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="464">Page 83 U. S. 464</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE HUNT delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The following propositions may be considered as settled in this Court.</p>\n<p>1. If an election or other fact is required to authorize the issue of the bonds of a municipal corporation, and if the result of that election, or the existence of that fact, is by law to be ascertained and declared by any judge, officer, or tribunal, and that judge, officer, or tribunal, on behalf of the corporation, executes, or issues the bonds, with a recital that the election has been held, or that the fact exists, or has taken place, this will be sufficient evidence of the fact to all <em>bona fide</em> holders of the bonds. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>2. If there be lawful authority for the municipality to issue </p><p><a class="page-number" name="465">Page 83 U. S. 465</a></p><p> its bonds, the omission of formalities and ceremonies, or the existence of fraud on the part of the agents of the municipality issuing the bonds, cannot be urged against a <em>bona fide</em> holder seeking to enforce them. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>3. There must, however, be an original authority, by statute, to the municipality to issue the bonds.  Municipal corporations have not the power, except through the special authority of the legislature, to issue corporate bonds which will bind their towns; neither have they the power to sell or mortgage the lands belonging to such towns without special authority. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>The alleged absence of such authority is the basis of the defense to the mortgage sought to be foreclosed in the present action.  Four several and distinct grounds on which such power is based are urged by the plaintiffs.  But one of these will be examined.  The court is satisfied with the authority to be found in the 10th section of the act to incorporate the Mount Vernon Railroad Company.  An examination of the others is not necessary.</p>\n<p>The Town of Mount Vernon is situated in Jefferson County, and some 18 miles easterly of the Illinois Central Railroad.  This road passes within a short distance of the westerly line of said county and nearly parallel with it.  Wayne County is still east of Jefferson County, the whole of the latter county lying between Wayne and the Illinois Central road.  In the month of February, 1855, the Legislature of Illinois passed an act to incorporate the Mount Vernon Railroad Company for the purpose of building a railroad from Mount Vernon to the Illinois Central Railroad or to its Chicago branch.  The 7th section of the act provided that the company might borrow money and secure the same by bond or mortgage.  By the 8th section it was enacted that the County of Jefferson might issue its bonds and provide for the payment thereof by the sale or mortgage of its swamp or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 83 U. S. 466</a></p><p> overflowed lands, or that they might make such other disposition of the lands in aid of the construction and maintenance of the railroad as they deemed best for the public interests of the county.</p>\n<p>The 9th section provided that the question of aiding the railroad, and of the mode in which such aid should be given, should be submitted to the decision of the voters of the county.</p>\n<p>The 10th section was in the following words:</p>\n<p>"Any county through which said road <em>may</em> run, and <em>every</em> county through which <em>any other railroad</em> may run, with which this road <em>may be joined, connected,</em> or <em>intersected, may,</em> and are hereby <em>authorized</em> and <em>empowered</em> to <em>aid</em> in the <em>construction</em> of the <em>same</em> or of <em>such other road</em> with which it may so connect, and for this purpose the provisions of the seventh, eighth, and ninth sections of this act <em>shall extend, include,</em> and be <em>applicable</em> to <em>every</em> such county and <em>every such</em> railroad."</p>\n<p>The provisions of the 7th, 8th, and 9th sections of the charter of the Mount Vernon Railroad Company were thus made applicable to any other county than that of Jefferson through which that road should run or through which any other railroad should run which might join, intersect, or connect with the Mount Vernon road.  Such other county was expressly authorized to aid in the construction of the Mount Vernon road or of such other road with which it might so connect.</p>\n<p>No reasonable construction of this act will require that the road to be aided should be actually built before the county was authorized to give it aid.  That theory would no doubt add greatly to the security of the county, and would relieve it from many of the perplexing questions which so commonly arise.  If, however, the road were actually built, no aid would be needed in its construction.  The aid might in that event be useful to its stockholders, or might relieve it from embarrassments, but a road which is built can neither need nor receive aid in its construction.  That is a fact accomplished.  The language of this act expressly authorizes the swamp or overflowed lands to be used </p><p><a class="page-number" name="467">Page 83 U. S. 467</a></p><p> by the counties in aid of the construction of the road, and it seems to be quite plain that the aid was intended to be given before the road was built, and that the counties were expected to take the ordinary risk of the success of the undertaking in which they embarked their property.</p>\n<p>The County of Wayne held an election in November, 1858, and voted that these lands should be applied in aid of any company that would build a railroad through the county.  Soon after this time Van Duser &amp; Smith entered into a contract with Wayne County for building that part of the road of the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Company lying between the east line of Wayne County and Mount Vernon, thus running across the entire width of Wayne County.  This contract was assigned to the Mount Vernon Railroad Company, who undertook the construction of this portion of the road.</p>\n<p>The county of Jefferson entered into a like contract for the construction of the Mount Vernon road, from Mount Vernon to the Illinois Central.</p>\n<p>It was for the purpose of aiding in the construction of the road thus undertaken to be built by the Mount Vernon Railroad Company from the east line of Wayne County to Mount Vernon, the charter of that company also requiring its road to be built from Mount Vernon to the Illinois Central, that the bonds in question were issued.  They were sold under the authority of the County of Wayne, by its agents, and the proceeds were applied as was intended by the county.  The Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company, afterwards changed to the St. Louis &amp; Louisville Railroad Company, was chartered for the construction of a railroad from St. Louis, on the Mississippi, to Mount Carmel, on the Wabash River.  Its proposed line crossed the Illinois Central, and was located directly through five different counties, among which was the County of Wayne.  It was that portion of the line of this road through the County of Wayne that was located and surveyed by the Mount Vernon Railroad Company and of which the construction was undertaken by that company, as the assignee of Van Duser &amp; Smith.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="468">Page 83 U. S. 468</a></p><p> Some portion of the work had then been done.  This brought the County of Wayne within the terms of the 10th section already quoted, and authorized its action in the issue of bonds to aid in its construction.</p>\n<p>These were existing contracts, under which the contracting parties were taking efficient measures for the construction of the road.  Those contracting parties could make no objection to the power of the counties so to contract.  The contracts were valid and obligatory against them, and would be effectual, if carried out, to make the railroad connections needed by the county.</p>\n<p>The authority to construct the connecting road, and the entering into a contract for its construction, formed a connection within the meaning of the 10th section.</p>\n<p>Such was also the opinion and the assertion of the County of Wayne, when, in November, 1856, it conveyed these lands to Charles Wood, in trust for certain railroads that should build a road through that county.</p>\n<p>The deed to Wood recites that a connection had been made between the Mount Vernon road and the others mentioned, that a vote had been taken in the County of Wayne authorizing that deed, and that it was made in pursuance thereof.  This deed was recognized and confirmed by the legislature, and expressly declared to be valid in the passage of the Act of February 14, 1857, to amend the charter of the Belleville &amp; Fairfield Railroad Company.  The lands were afterwards reconveyed to the county by Mr. Wood.</p>\n<p>Holding that there was valid power for the giving of the mortgage in question by the County of Wayne under the 10th section of the Mount Vernon charter, and that there was in fact and in law a sufficient connection with other roads, we do not deem it necessary either to examine the other alleged sources of authority for the execution of the mortgage, or the alleged acts of the county in confirmation of it.  Under the circumstances stated, we are also of the opinion that there was a sufficient submission of the question to the voters of the county, and that as against <em>bona fide</em> holders for value the question is not an open one.  It </p><p><a class="page-number" name="469">Page 83 U. S. 469</a></p><p> has been decided at the present term of this Court, that where a note secured by a mortgage is transferred to a <em>bona fide</em> holder for value before maturity, and a bill is filed to foreclose the mortgage, no other or further defenses are allowed as against the mortgage than would be allowed were the action brought in a court of law upon the note. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>In this action to foreclose the mortgage, the case stands in this respect as it would stand had the present suit been brought directly upon the bonds, and without reference to the mortgage.</p>\n<p>The execution of the deed and mortgage by Wilson and Scott, the judges of the county court of Wayne County, and on behalf of the county, was a sufficient execution by the county.  In the mortgage and trust deed all the proceedings to authorize a conveyance by the county are recited -- the title of the swamp lands in the county through an act of Congress; the authority of the state to dispose of the same by the courts or county judges; the passage of the act incorporating the Mount Vernon Railroad Company -- and that the parties of the first part were duly authorized on behalf of the county to make disposition of the land in aid of the construction of the railroad; that the question had been referred to and passed upon by the voters of the county; that, by virtue of all the proceedings recited, the said judges, parties of the first part, had become endowed with power to dispose of the lands; therefore they conveyed, as set forth.  This conveyance was, on the 20th of April, 1859, by an order that day entered in its minutes, recognized and confirmed as the act of the County of Wayne by its authorized agents, and by which the lands were mortgaged and conveyed.  The 7th section of the Mount Vernon Railroad act, above referred to, vests the power to dispose of these lands in the county court.  This body must act by agents, and none can be more suitable and appropriate than the judges of the court.  By the 2d section of the act to dispose of swamp and overflowed lands, passed January 22d, 1852, it is provided that in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="470">Page 83 U. S. 470</a></p><p> cases in the 1st section mentioned, the deed of conveyance shall be made by the judges of the county court as such, and countersigned by the clerk with his official seal.  In reference to sales at auction, it is provided by the 11th section that a conveyance shall be executed by "the court, signed in their official capacity," and countersigned by the clerk.  The signature of the clerk is nowhere declared to be an absolute prerequisite.  In effect this was a conveyance on behalf of the county, by their agents for that purpose duly appointed.  By the 7th section of the Mount Vernon charter, the county court was authorized to sell or mortgage the lands, or to make such other disposition of them "as they may deem best for the public interest."  No mode was pointed out in which a conveyance should be made.  No particular signature was made a condition to the validity of the conveyance.  There is no ground for the objection to the form here adopted, <em>viz.,</em> by a deed of trust and mortgage, signed by the judges of the county court.  In form and in substance, the deed was well executed and valid as the deed of the county.</p>\n<p>The objection to the word "bonus" in the proposition submitted to the voters of Wayne County is not valid.  This submission, in connection with the general subject of a failure to comply with the requisites prescribed by the statute, has been already discussed.  Upon its individual merits, we are also of the opinion that the objection is not valid.  It is a verbal criticism merely -- an objection to the words and not to the substance of the submission.  A proposition was submitted to the voters, of which the affirmative was in these words:  "For appropriating the swamp lands of Wayne as a bonus to any company for building a railroad through said county."  It is said that the word "bonus" condemns the submission; that this word means a gratuity, a voluntary donation, a gift, and that a town or county cannot, although it have the direct authority of the legislature, give away its property.  When this question is properly before us, it will be disposed of.  It does not, however, arise in this case.  In the first place, if it be assumed that the word is correctly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="471">Page 83 U. S. 471</a></p><p> defined as a gift, or gratuity, that meaning is controlled and limited by the connection in which it is here used, to-wit that in consideration of it, the company receiving the lands will undertake to build a railroad through the county.  It is not simply a bonus, but a bonus to any company who shall undertake the great task of building a railroad through the county, a task which, it is loudly complained, has not yet been performed by anyone.</p>\n<p>But, secondly, the meaning of the word bonus is not that given to it by the objection.  It is thus defined by Webster:</p>\n<p>"A premium given for a loan or a charter or other privilege granted to a company; as, the bank paid a <em>bonus</em> for its charter; a sum paid in addition to a stated compensation."</p>\n<p>It is not a gift or gratuity, but a sum paid for services, or upon a consideration in addition to or in excess of that which would ordinarily be given.</p>\n<p>Upon the principles announced in the opening of this opinion, the plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment for the amount of the bonds held by them.  If we are right in the positions taken, there was indeed no real defense to the bonds.</p>\n<p>We think there was error in the decision of the case; that the judgment must be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and a new trial had.</em></p>\n<p>MR.
