Adjacent to one of those highways is an area that the Government has designated for peaceful protests.

The Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that because the easement through Vandenberg deprived the Government of exclusive possession, \xc2\xa71382 did not cover the portion of the Base where Apel\xe2\x80\x99s protest occurred. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0A \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. installation\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71382 encompasses the commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s area of responsibility, and it includes Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s highways and protest area.

The statute is written broadly to apply to many different kinds of military places, and nothing in its text defines those places in terms of the access granted to the public or the nature of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s possessory interest.  See United States v. Albertini,\n\n472 U.\xc2\xa0S. 675\n.  Nor have military places been defined historically as land withdrawn from public use.  The common feature of the places described in \xc2\xa71382 is that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.  This conclusion is confirmed by United States v. Phisterer,\n\n94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219\n, which defined the term \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary station\xe2\x80\x9d as a place \xe2\x80\x9cwhere military duty is performed or military protection afforded.\xe2\x80\x9d  And while some Executive Branch documents have said that \xc2\xa71382 requires exclusive possession, those opinions are nonbinding, and this Court has never held that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.

Apel contends that the highways and protest area are outside the Base because they lie outside fenced areas on the Base, but this argument assumes the conclusion.  The United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force.  The Air Force\xe2\x80\x99s choice to secure a portion of the Base more closely does not alter its boundaries or diminish its commander\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction.  Apel\xe2\x80\x99s further contention that the highways and protest area are uncontrolled spaces where military operations are not performed is contrary to the record: The Base commander has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area and has publicly stated that persons barred from Vandenberg may not enter the Base to protest; the District Court found that the Government exercises substantial control over the protest area; the easement itself reserves to the Base commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base when necessary and reserves to the United States rights of way for all purposes; and the Base commander has occasionally closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.  In any event, \xc2\xa71382 does not require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude certain individuals.  Such a use-it-or-lose-it rule would frustrate the administration of military facilities, raise difficult questions for judges, and discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for public convenience.

The Base sits on land owned by the United States and administered by the Department of the Air Force.  It is the site of sensitive missile and space launch facilities.  The commander of Vandenberg has designated it a \xe2\x80\x9cclosed base,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that civilians may not enter without express permission.

Pursuant to that easement, two state roads traverse the Base.  Highway 1 (the Pacific Coast Highway) runs through the eastern part of the Base and provides a route between the towns of Santa Maria and Lompoc.  Highway 246 runs through the southern part of the Base and allows access to a beach and a train station on Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s western edge.  The State of California maintains and po-lices these highways as it does other state roads, except that its jurisdiction is merely \xe2\x80\x9cconcurrent\xe2\x80\x9d with that ofthe Federal Government.  Letter from Governor Edmund G. Brown, Jr., to Joseph C. Zengerle, Assistant Secretary of the Air Force (July 21, 1981), App. 40.

There Highway 1 intersects with Lompoc Casmalia Road, which continues running northwest, and with California Boulevard, which runs southwest.  In the east corner of this intersection there is a middle school.  In the west corner there is a visitors\xe2\x80\x99 center and a public bus stop.  A short way down California Boulevard is the main entrance to the operational areas of the Base where military personnel live and work.

Memorandum for the General Public Re: Limited Permission for Peaceful Protest Activity Policy, from David J. Buck, Commander (Oct. 23, 2008), App. 57\xe2\x80\x9358.

In March 2003, Apel trespassed beyond the designated protest area and threw blood on a sign for the Base.  He was convicted for these actions, was sentenced to two months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, and was barred from the Base for three years.  In May 2007, Apel returned to Vandenberg to protest.  When he trespassed again and was convicted, he received another order barring him from Vandenberg, this time permanently, unless he followed specified procedures \xe2\x80\x9cto modify or revoke\xe2\x80\x9d the order.  Memorandum for John D. Apel Re: Barment Order (Oct. 22, 2007), App. 63\xe2\x80\x9365.  The only exception to the barment was limited permission from the Base commander for Apel to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traverse\xe2\x80\x99, meaning to travel .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on [Highway] 1 and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on [Highway] 246 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.

Apel appealed to the Federal District Court for the Central District of California.  The District Court rejected Apel\xe2\x80\x99s defense that \xc2\xa71382 does not apply to the designated protest area, holding that the military \xe2\x80\x9chas a sufficient possessory interest and exercises sufficient control over\xe2\x80\x9d the area.

And certainly Vandenberg would naturally be described as a \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary installation\xe2\x80\x9d: it is an Air Force base, which a military commander has closed to the public (with limited exceptions), located on land owned by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Air Force, where military personnel conduct sensitive missile operations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Against this straightforward interpretation, Apel insists that \xc2\xa71382 applies only where the military exercises exclusive possession and control, which, he contends, does not include land subject to a roadway easement.  Apel further argues that the fence enclosing Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s operational facilities marks the real boundary of the Base and that Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s commander lacks authority to control the rest, or at least the designated protest area.

Q. 37, 37, 40\xe2\x80\x9341 (Jan. 1971) (describing a 19th-century post in southwestern present Wyoming which included a \xe2\x80\x9csutler,\xe2\x80\x9d a civilian merchant who set up shop inside the fort and sold wares both to soldiers and to civilians from outside the base).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The common feature of the places described in \xc2\xa71382 is not that they are used exclusively by the military, but that they have defined boundaries and are subject to the command authority of a military officer.  That makes sense, because the Solicitor General has informed us that a military commander\xe2\x80\x99s authority is frequently defined by the boundaries of a particular place: When the Department of Defense establishes a base, military commanders assign a military unit to the base, and the commanding officer of the unit becomes the commander of the base.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6\xe2\x80\x937.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Apel responds by invoking our decision in United States v. Phisterer,\n\n94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 219 (1877)\n, which held that the term \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary station\xe2\x80\x9d (in a different statute) did not includea soldier\xe2\x80\x99s off-base home.  But Phisterer only confirmsour conclusion that \xc2\xa71382 does not require exclusive use, possession, or control.  For there we interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary station\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9ca place where troops are assembled, where military stores, animate or inanimate, are kept or distributed, where military duty is performed or military protection afforded,\xe2\x80\x94where something, in short, more or less closely connected with arms or war is kept or is to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 222.  To describe a place as \xe2\x80\x9cmore or less closely connected\xe2\x80\x9d with military activities hardly requires that the military hold an exclusive right to the property.  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary duty\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary protection\xe2\x80\x9d are synonymous with the exercise of military jurisdiction.  And that, not coincidentally, is precisely how the term \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary installation\xe2\x80\x9d is used elsewhere in federal law.  See, e.g.,\n\n10 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72687(g)(1) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary installation\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cbase .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Department of Defense\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa72801(c)(4) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary installation\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cbase .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. or other activity under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of a military department\xe2\x80\x9d); 32 CFR \xc2\xa7809a.0 (\xe2\x80\x9cThis part prescribes the commanders\xe2\x80\x99 authority for enforcing order within or near Air Force installations under their jurisdiction and controlling entry to those installations\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Apel also relies on the fact that some Executive Branch documents, including the United States Attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 Man-ual and opinions of the Air Force Judge Advocate General, have said that \xc2\xa71382 requires exclusive possession.  Brief for Respondent 44\xe2\x80\x9347.  So they have, and that is a point in his favor.  But those opinions are not intended to be binding.  See Dept. of Justice, United States Attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 Man-ual \xc2\xa71\xe2\x80\x931.100 (2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Manual provides only internal Department of Justice guidance.  It is not intended to, does not, and may not be relied upon to create any rights, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by any party in any matter civil or criminal\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 Civil Law Opinionsof The Judge Advocate General, United States Air Force 1978\xe2\x80\x931983 (Preface) (opinions of the Judge Advocate Gen-eral \xe2\x80\x9care good starting points but should not be citedas precedence [sic] without first verifying the validity of the conclusions by independent research\xe2\x80\x9d).  Their views may reflect overly cautious legal advice based on division in the lower courts.  Or they may reflect legal error.  Either way, we have never held that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s reading of a criminal statute is entitled to any deference.  See Crandon v. United States,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 152,\n177 (1990)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Today, as throughout our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, there is sig-nificant variation in the ownership status of U.\xc2\xa0S. mil-itary sites around the world.  Some are owned in fee, others are leased.  Some are routinely open to the public, others are open for specific occasions or purposes, and no public access whatsoever is permitted on others.  Many, including such well-known places as the Washington Navy Yard and the United States Air Force Academy, have roads running through them that are used freely by the public.  Nothing in \xc2\xa71382 or our history suggests that the statute does not apply to a military base under the command of the Air Force, merely because the Government has conveyed a limited right to travel through a portion of the base or to assemble in a particular area.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Section 1382 is most naturally read to apply to places with a defined boundary under the command of a military officer.  Apel argues, however, that Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s commander has no authority on the highways running through the Base or, apparently, in the designated protest area.  His arguments more or less reduce to two contentions: that the highways and protest area lie \xe2\x80\x9coutside the entrance to [a] closed military installation[\xc2\xa0],\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 22, and that they are \xe2\x80\x9cuncontrolled\xe2\x80\x9d spaces where \xe2\x80\x9cno military operations are performed,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 23.  Neither contention is sound.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, to say that the highway and protest area are \xe2\x80\x9coutside\xe2\x80\x9d the Vandenberg installation is not a legal ar-gument; it simply assumes the conclusion.  Perhaps recognizing as much, Apel tacks: He suggests that because Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s operational facilities are surrounded by a fence and guarded by a security checkpoint, the Government has determined that it does not control the rest of the Base.  The problem with this argument is that the United States has placed the entire Vandenberg property under the administration of the Air Force, which has defined that property as an Air Force base and designated the Base commander to exercise jurisdiction.  Federal law makes the commander responsible \xe2\x80\x9cfor the protection or security of\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cproperty subject to the jurisdiction, administration, or in the custody of the Department of Defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  50 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7797(a)(2), (4); see also 32 CFR \xc2\xa7809a.2(a) (\xe2\x80\x9cAir Force installation commanders are responsible for protecting personnel and property under their jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d).  And pursuant to that authority, the Base commander has issued an order closing the entire base to the public.  Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51; see also 32 CFR \xc2\xa7809a.3 (\xe2\x80\x9cany directive issued by the commander of a military installation or facility, which includes the parameters for authorized entry to or exit from a military installation, is legally enforceable against all persons\xe2\x80\x9d).  The fact that the Air Force chooses to securea portion of the Base more closely\xe2\x80\x94be it with a fence, a checkpoint, or a painted green line\xe2\x80\x94does not alter the boundaries of the Base or diminish the jurisdiction of the military commander.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As for Apel\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the protest area specifically is uncontrolled, the record is conclusively to the contrary.  The Base commander \xe2\x80\x9cat all times has retained authority and control over who may access the installation,\xe2\x80\x9d including the protest area.  Buck Memorandum Re: Protest Activity, App. 58.  He has enacted rules to restrict the manner of protests in the designated area.  Protest Advisory, App. 53.  In particular, he requires two weeks\xe2\x80\x99 notice to schedule a protest and prohibits the distribution of pamphlets or leaflets.  Id., at 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  The Base com-mander has also publicly stated that persons who are barred from Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x94for whatever reason\xe2\x80\x94may not come onto the Base to protest.  Id., at 54.  And the District Court found, after hearing testimony, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government exercises substantial control over the designated protest area, including, for example, patrolling the area.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 14a\xe2\x80\x9315a.  Apel has never disputed these facts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Instead Apel tells us that, by granting an easement, the military has \xe2\x80\x9crelinquished its right to exclude civilians from Highway 1,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 36, and that the easement does not \xe2\x80\x9cpermit[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d use by the military, id., at 43.  But the easement itself specifically reserves to Vandenberg\xe2\x80\x99s commander the authority to restrict access to the entire Base, including Highway 1, when necessary \xe2\x80\x9cto properly protect the interests of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d and likewise \xe2\x80\x9creserves to [the United States] rights-of-way for all purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Easement, App. 36.  We simply do not understand how Apel can claim that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]othing in the easement contemplates, or even permits, military use or occupation; it provides for exclusive civil use and occupation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 43.  Moreover, the Base commander, in an exercise of his command authority, has notified the public that use of the roads is \xe2\x80\x9climited to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. vehicular travel activity through the base,\xe2\x80\x9d which does not include Apel\xe2\x80\x99s protest activity.  See Buck Memorandum Re: Closed Base, App. 51.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Apel likewise offers no support for his contention that military functions do not occur on the easement highways.  The Government has referred us to instances when the commander of Vandenberg has closed the highways to the public for security purposes or when conducting a military launch.  Reply Brief 12, and n. 5; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8\xe2\x80\x939.  In any event, there is no indication that Congress intended \xc2\xa71382 to require base commanders to make continuous, uninterrupted use of a place within their jurisdiction, lest they lose authority to exclude individuals who have vandalized military property and been determined to pose a threat to the order and security of the base.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, we decline Apel\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to require civilian judges to examine U.\xc2\xa0S. military sites around the world, parcel by parcel, to determine which have roads, which have fences, and which have a sufficiently important, persistent military purpose.  The use-it-or-lose-it rule that Apel proposes would frustrate the administration of military facilities and raise difficult questions for judges, who are not expert in military operations.  And it would discourage commanders from opening portions of their bases for the convenience of the public.  We think a much better reading of \xc2\xa71382 is that it reaches all property within the defined boundaries of a military place that is under the command of a military officer.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Much of the rest of Apel\xe2\x80\x99s brief is devoted to arguing that \xc2\xa71382 would be unconstitutional as applied to him on this Base.  But the Court of Appeals never reached Apel\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional arguments, and we decline to do so in the first instance.  Apel also attempts to repackage his\n \nFirst Amendment objections as a statutory interpretation argument based on constitutional avoidance.  See Brief for Respondent 54 (\xe2\x80\x9cthe statute should be interpreted .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. not to apply to peaceful protests on a public road outside of a closed military base over which an easement has been granted and that has been declared a protest zone\xe2\x80\x9d).  But we do not \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret\xe2\x80\x9d statutes by gerrymandering them with a list of exceptions that happen to describe a party\xe2\x80\x99s case.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe canon [of constitutional avoidance] is not a method of adjudicating constitutional questions by other means.\xe2\x80\x9d  Clark v. Martinez,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 371,\n381 (2005)\n.  Whether \xc2\xa71382 is unconstitutional as applied is a question we need not address.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Where a place with a defined boundary is under the administration of a military department, the limits of the \xe2\x80\x9cmilitary installation\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa71382 are coterminous with the commanding officer\xe2\x80\x99s area of responsibility.  Those limits do not change when the commander invites the public to use a portion of the base for a road, a school, a bus stop, or a protest area, especially when the commander reserves authority to protect military property by, among other things, excluding vandals and trespassers.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The judgment of the Court of Appeals is vacated, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is so ordered.</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"> </p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970821">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 12\xe2\x80\x931038</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">UNITED STATES, PETITIONER v.

That interest, however, must be assessed in light of the general public\xe2\x80\x99s (including Apel\xe2\x80\x99s) permission to traverse, at any hour of the day or night, the highway located a few feet from the designated protest area.  See Appendix to opinion of the Court, ante (displaying maps of the area).
