One of the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s primary witnesses at Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s trial was Bernard Jackson, who admitted to being involved in the robbery and identified Bruce Reese and Lambert as his accomplices.  Almost 20 years later, Lambert brought a claim for postconviction relief in Pennsylvania state court, alleging that the Commonwealth had failed to disclose, inter alia, a \xe2\x80\x9cpolice activity sheet\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of Brady v. Maryland, \n\n373 U.\xc2\xa0S. 83 (1963)\n.  This document, dated October 25, 1982, noted that a photo display containing a picture of an individual named Lawrence Woodlock was shown to two witnesses to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery, but that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o identification was made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Exh. 1, App. to Brief in Opposition.  The document further noted that \xe2\x80\x9cMr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant\xe2\x80\x9d by Jackson, who was in custody at the time on several charges and had admitted to involvement in at least 13 armed robberies of bars.  Ibid.  The activity sheet did not indicate whether Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s reference was to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge crime or one of the others.  The sheet bore the names of the law enforcement officers involved in the investigation of the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery.  It also bore the names of the robbery\xe2\x80\x99s murder victims, as well as the police case numbers for those murders.  The Commonwealth has identified no evidence that Woodlock was ever investigated for any other robbery, or that his photo was shown to a witness in any other robbery.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLambert claimed that the activity sheet was exculpa-tory, because it suggested that someone other than or in addition to him, Jackson, and Reese was involved in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge crime.  Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 472, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d 848, 855 (2005).  Lambert also argued that he could have used the activity sheet to impeach Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s testimony at trial, because the statement attributed to Jackson suggested that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a participant prior to identifying Lambert.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Commonwealth countered that the asserted \xe2\x80\x9cstatement\xe2\x80\x9d by Jackson reflected in the activity sheet was in fact nothing more than an \xe2\x80\x9cambiguously worded notation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Commonwealth argued that this notation sim-ply indicated that Jackson had named Woodlock as a \xe2\x80\x9cco-defendant\xe2\x80\x9d in some incident, without specifying whether Woodlock was said to be involved in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery or one of the dozen other robberies in which  Jackson had admitted participating.  In this regard, the Commonwealth noted that Woodlock\xe2\x80\x99s name was not mentioned anywhere else in the police records, trial proceedings, or Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s statements about the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery.  As the Commonwealth has put it, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems likely that Jackson identified [Woodlock] as a participant in one of his many other robberies, and police simply confirmed that Woodlock had nothing to do with this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply to Brief in Opposition 2.  The Commonwealth \xe2\x80\x9cfurther note[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that the document would not have advanced any impeachment of Jackson, because he had already been extensively impeached at trial.  Lambert, 584 Pa., at 472, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 855.  Thus, according to the Commonwealth, the \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous reference to Woodlock\xe2\x80\x9d would not have discredited Jackson any further.  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed with the Commonwealth and unanimously rejected Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s Brady claim, holding that the disputed document was not material.  Id., at 472\xe2\x80\x93473, 848 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 855\xe2\x80\x93856.  The court concluded that there was no reasonable probability that the result of Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s trial would have been different had the document been disclosed.  Ibid.  See Strickler v. Greene, \n\n527 U. S. 263, \n281 (1999)\n.  Calling Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the reference to Woodlock \xe2\x80\x9cautomatically\xe2\x80\x9d meant someone else was involved in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery \xe2\x80\x9cpurely speculative at best,\xe2\x80\x9d the court noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\xe2\x80\x9d  584 Pa., at 473, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 855.  \xe2\x80\x9cMoreover,\xe2\x80\x9d the court continued, the document \xe2\x80\x9cwould not have materially furthered the impeachment of Jackson at trial as he was already extensively impeached by both [Lambert] and Reese.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLambert filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania under \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254, claiming, inter alia, that the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s failure to disclose the document violated his rights under Brady.  The District Court denied the writ, holding that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 determination that the notations \xe2\x80\x9cwere not exculpatory or impeaching\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lambert v. Beard, Civ. Action No. 02\xe2\x80\x939034 (July 24, 2007), App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36.  The court explained that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he various notations and statements which [Lambert] claims the Commonwealth should have disclosed are en-tirely ambiguous, and would have required the state courts to speculate to conclude they were favorable for Lambert and material to his guilt or punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 36.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn appeal, however, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed and granted the writ.  633 F. 3d 126 (2011).  The Third Circuit concluded that it was \xe2\x80\x9cpatently unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d for the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to presume that whenever a witness is impeached in one manner, any other impeachment evidence would be im-material.  Id., at 134.  According to the Third Circuit, the notation that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a \xe2\x80\x9cco-defendant\xe2\x80\x9d would have \xe2\x80\x9copened an entirely new line of impeachment\xe2\x80\x9d because the prosecutor at trial had relied on the fact that Jackson had consistently named Lambert as the third participant in the robbery.  Id., at 135.  The Commonwealth petitioned for certiorari.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) precludes a federal court from granting a writ of habeas corpus to a state prisoner unless the state court\xe2\x80\x99s adjudication of his claim \xe2\x80\x9cresulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1).  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder \xc2\xa72254(d), a habeas court must determine what arguments or theories supported . . . the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Harrington v. Richter, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 12).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this case, however, the Third Circuit overlooked the determination of the state courts that the notations were, as the District Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cnot exculpatory or impeaching\xe2\x80\x9d but instead \xe2\x80\x9centirely ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 34, 36.  Instead, the Third Circuit focused solely on the alternative ground that any impeachment value that might have been obtained from the notations would have been cumulative.  If the conclusion in the state courts about the content of the document was reasonable\xe2\x80\x94not necessarily correct, but reasonable\xe2\x80\x94whatever those courts had to say about cumulative impeachment evidence would be beside the point.  The failure of the Third Circuit even to address the \xe2\x80\x9cambiguous\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the notations, and the \xe2\x80\x9cspeculat[ive]\xe2\x80\x9d nature of Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s reading of them, is especially surprising, given that this was the basis of the District Court ruling.

It did so because of a police activity sheet noting that Jackson had identified Woodlock as a \xe2\x80\x9cco-defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d and bearing other information associating the sheet with the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery.  The Court of Appeals, however, failed to address the state court ruling that the reference to Woodlock was ambiguous and any connection to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery speculative.  That ruling\xe2\x80\x94on which we do not now opine\xe2\x80\x94may well be reasonable, given that (1) the activity sheet did not explicitly link Woodlock to the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery, (2) Jackson had committed a dozen other such robberies, (3) Jackson was being held on several charges when the activity sheet was prepared, (4) Woodlock\xe2\x80\x99s name appeared nowhere else in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge files, and (5) the two witnesses from the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge robbery who were shown Woodlock\xe2\x80\x99s photo did not identify him as involved in that crime.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAny retrial here would take place three decades after the crime, posing the most daunting difficulties for the prosecution.

Post, at 1 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  No one disputes that.  The ambiguity at issue concerns whether Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s statement referred to that crime, or one of his many others.  The dissent also finds \xe2\x80\x9cno suggestion\xe2\x80\x9d that the state courts believed Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Woodlock \xe2\x80\x9ccontained the argued ambiguity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 3.  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court, however, recognized the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Jackson could have named Woodlock as a codefendant in some other robbery, and concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Commonwealth accurately notes that the police must not have had reason to consider Woodlock a potential codefendant in this case as his name is not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\xe2\x80\x9d  Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 473, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d 848, 855 (2005).

I cannot agree.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor one thing, I cannot accept that the \xe2\x80\x9cnotations\xe2\x80\x9d at issue are \xe2\x80\x9centirely ambiguous.\xe2\x80\x9d  I attach a copy of the relevant police notation.  See Appendix, infra.  The notation clearly refers to this case, not to some other case.  It sets forth the file number of this investigation, the investigators of this crime, the victims of this murder, and the potential witnesses of these events.  It does not refer specifically to any other robbery.  The notation says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] [p]hoto display was shown to . . . [witnesses in this case],\xe2\x80\x9d and it specifies that the \xe2\x80\x9c[p]hoto display contained a Lawrence WOODLOCK.\xe2\x80\x9d  In this context, the words must refer to a display that included persons potentially involved in this robbery.  That being so, the most natural reading of the statement, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. WOODLOCK is named as co-defendant by Bernard JACKSON,\xe2\x80\x9d is that it too refers to this murder and not to some other crime.

There were no such state court \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 4.  Rather, the state trial court wrote that the notation was not material for Brady purposes only because \xe2\x80\x9cJackson was comprehensively impeached\xe2\x80\x9d at trial and \xe2\x80\x9cit is not reasonable to believe that Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s further inconsistency found only in a police activity sheet and not in any of his statements to police would have caused the jury to discredit him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record 228 (emphasis added).  As the italicized words make clear, if the trial court expressed any view about ambiguity, it thought that the police notation was not ambiguous.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court did point out that the Commonwealth argued that the document was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ambig- uously worded.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Commonwealth v. Lambert, 584 Pa. 461, 472, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d 848, 855 (2005).  But the court did not adopt this rationale.  Rather, it found the document not material with respect to impeachment because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny additional impeachment of Jackson arising from a police notation would have been cumulative.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 473, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 856.  The Third Circuit disagreed with the state courts in respect to this last-mentioned holding.  But this Court does not take issue with the Third Circuit on this point.  The Court points out, instead, that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court used the word \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98speculative.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 3.  But in context it is clear that the court used that word to refer to Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s claim that the notation showed that he was innocent.  With respect to that claim (not at issue here), the court wrote: \xe2\x80\x9c[Lambert\xe2\x80\x99s] claim that Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s reference to Woodlock automatically means that someone other than himself committed the shootings and robbery is purely speculative at best.\xe2\x80\x9d  584 Pa., at 473, 884 A.\xc2\xa02d, at 855.  And it supported the \xe2\x80\x9cspeculative\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the innocence claim by pointing out that Woodlock\xe2\x80\x99s name \xe2\x80\x9cis not mentioned anywhere else in the police investigation files.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  There is no suggestion that the notation contained the argued ambiguity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Circuit questioned the strength of the case against Lambert.  See Lambert v. Beard, 633 F.\xc2\xa03d 126, 135\xe2\x80\x93136 (CA3 2011).  It pointed out that the case against Lambert was largely based on Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s testimony, explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cwithout Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s statements to the police, the Commonwealth could not have indicted Lambert on these charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 131.  Yet Jackson had made \xe2\x80\x9cfour prior inconsistent statements to the police about who did what and who said what on the night in question,\xe2\x80\x9d and he had admitted that his goal in testifying was \xe2\x80\x9cto save himself from a death sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Circuit could not \xe2\x80\x9chelp but observe that the evidence is very strong that Reese, not Lambert, was the shooter, even assuming that Lambert (and not Jackson, as two of the barmaids testified) was in the Prince\xe2\x80\x99s Lounge that night.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 135.  The Circuit stated: \xe2\x80\x9cOne wonders how the Commonwealth could have based this case of first-degree murder on a Bernard Jackson.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 131.  These statements suggest that the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s case against Lambert was unusually weak.  If the Commonwealth was wrong, an innocent man has spent almost 30 years in prison under sentence of death for a crime he did not commit.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe do not normally consider questions of the type presented here, namely fact-specific questions about whether a lower court properly applied the well-established legal principles that it sets forth in its opinion.  See Kyles v. Whitley, \n\n514 U.\xc2\xa0S. 419, \n460 (1995)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting) (An \xe2\x80\x9cintensely fact-specific case in which the court below unquestionably applied the correct rule of law and did not unquestionably err\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely the type of case in which we are most inclined to deny certiorari\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, for the reasons I have stated, I believe the Court is ill advised to grant certiorari in this case.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI would deny the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s petition for a writ of certiorari.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tAppendix\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t[Graphic omitted; see printed opinion.]\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
