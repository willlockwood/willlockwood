To secure the warrant, federal officials had told a Magistrate Judge that information \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial\xe2\x80\x9d to Sami Omar al-Hussayen\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution would be lost if al-Kidd boarded his flight.  Prosecutors never called al-Kidd as a witness, and (as he alleges) never meant to do so.  Al-Kidd filed suit pursuant to <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a>, challenging the constitutionality of Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s alleged policy.  The District Court denied Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss on absolute and qualified immunity grounds.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or absolute immunity.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive.

S. 287</a>, 294, this Court has almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent.  The Court of Appeals was mistaken in believing that <em>Edmond </em>established that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98programmatic purpose\xe2\x80\x99 is relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d 949, 968.  It was not the absence of probable cause that triggered <em>Edmond</em>\xe2\x80\x99s invalidating-purpose inquiry, but the checkpoints\xe2\x80\x99 failure to be based on \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 47.  Here a neutral Magistrate Judge issued a warrant authorizing al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, and the affidavit accompanying the warrant application gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness who would soon disappear.  A warrant based on individualized suspicion grants more protection than existed in most of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases eschewing inquiries into intent, <em>e.g., Whren</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U.

Al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s contrary, narrow reading of those cases is rejected.  Because he concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issuance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretext; there is no Fourth Amendment violation here.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law and thus is entitled to qualified immunity.  A Government official\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear\xe2\x80\x9d that every \xe2\x80\x9creasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U.

At the time of al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s arrest, not a single judicial opinion had held that pretext could render an objectively reasonable arrest pursuant to a material-witness warrant unconstitutional.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s footnoted dictum, irrelevant cases from this Court, and the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s broad purposes and history is rejected.  Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, the question whether he enjoys absolute immunity need not be addressed.

Material witnesses enjoy the same constitutional right to pretrial release as other federal detainees, and federal law requires release if their testimony \xe2\x80\x9ccan adequately be secured by deposition, and if further detention is not nec-essary to prevent a failure of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations in Abdullah al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  The complaint alleges that, in the aftermath of the September 11th terrorist attacks, then-Attorney General John Ashcroft authorized federal prosecutors and law enforcement officials to use the material-witness statute to detain individuals with suspected ties to terrorist organizations.  It is alleged that federal officials had no intention of calling most of these individuals as witnesses, and that they were detained, at Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s direction, because federal officials suspected them of supporting terrorism but lacked sufficient evidence to charge them with a crime.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is alleged that this pretextual detention policy led\nto the material-witness arrest of al-Kidd, a native-born United States citizen.  FBI agents apprehended him in March 2003 as he checked in for a flight to Saudi Arabia.  Two days earlier, federal officials had informed a Magistrate Judge that, if al-Kidd boarded his flight, they believed information \xe2\x80\x9ccrucial\xe2\x80\x9d to the prosecution of Sami Omar al-Hussayen would be lost.  App. 64.  Al-Kidd remained in federal custody for 16 days and on supervised release until al-Hussayen\xe2\x80\x99s trial concluded 14 months later.  Prosecutors never called him as a witness.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In March 2005, al-Kidd filed this Bivens</em> action, see <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed. Narcotics Agents,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/388/index.html">403 U. S. 388</a> (1971) to challenge the constitutionality of Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s alleged policy; he also asserted several other claims not relevant here against Ashcroft and others.  Ashcroft filed a motion to dismiss based on absolute and qualified immunity, which the District Court denied.  A divided panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that the Fourth Amendment prohibits pretextual arrests absent probable cause of criminal wrongdoing, and that Ashcroft could not claim qualified or absolute immunity.  See 580 F.\xc2\xa03d 949 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Bea dissented, 580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 981, and eight judges dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc, see 598 F.\xc2\xa03d 1129, 1137, 1142 (CA9 2010).  We granted certiorari, see 562 U. S. ___ (2010).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Qualified immunity shields federal and state officials from money damages unless a plaintiff pleads facts showing (1) that the official violated a statutory or constitutional right, and (2) that the right was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the challenged conduct.  <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U. S. 800</a>, 818 (1982).  We recently reaffirmed that lower courts have discretion to decide which of the two prongs of qualified-immunity analysis to tackle first.  See <em>Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/223/index.html">555 U. S. 223</a>, 236 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Courts should think carefully before expending \xe2\x80\x9cscarce judicial resources\xe2\x80\x9d to resolve difficult and novel questions of constitutional or statutory interpretation that will \xe2\x80\x9chave no effect on the outcome of the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 236\xe2\x80\x93237; see <em>id.,</em> at 237\xe2\x80\x93242.  When, however, a Court of Appeals does address both prongs of qualified-immunity analysis, we have discretion to correct its errors at each step.  Although not necessary to reverse an erroneous judgment, doing so ensures that courts do not insulate constitutional decisions at the frontiers of the law from our review or inadvertently undermine the values qualified immunity seeks to promote.  The former occurs when the constitutional-law question is wrongly decided; the latter when what is not clearly established is held to be so.  In this case, the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis at both steps of the qualified-immunity inquiry needs correction.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Fourth Amendment protects \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  An arrest, of course, qualifies as a \xe2\x80\x9cseizure\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d under this provision, <em>Dunaway</em> v. <em>New York</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/442/200/index.html">442 U. S. 200</a>, 207\xe2\x80\x93208 (1979), and so must be reasonable under the circumstances.  Al-Kidd does not assert that Government officials would have acted unreasonably if they had used a material-witness warrant to arrest him for the purpose of securing his testimony for trial.  See Brief for Respondent 16\xe2\x80\x9317; Tr. of Oral Arg. 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  He contests, however (and the Court of Appeals here rejected), the reasonableness of using the warrant to detain him as a suspected criminal.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth Amendment reasonableness \xe2\x80\x9cis predominantly an objective inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Edmond</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 47.  We ask whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the challenged] action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/436/128/index.html">436 U. S. 128</a>, 138 (1978).  If so, that action was reasonable \xe2\x80\x9c<em>whatever</em> the subjective intent\xe2\x80\x9d motivating the relevant officials.  <em>Whren</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a>, 814 (1996).  This approach recognizes that the Fourth Amendment regulates conduct rather than thoughts, <em>Bond</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/334/index.html">529 U. S. 334</a>, 338, n.\xc2\xa02 (2000); and it promotes evenhanded, uniform enforcement of the law, <em>Devenpeck</em> v. <em>Alford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/146/index.html">543 U. S. 146</a>, 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two \xe2\x80\x9climited exception[s]\xe2\x80\x9d to this rule are our special-needs and administrative-search cases, where \xe2\x80\x9cactual motivations\xe2\x80\x9d do matter.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Knights</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/112/index.html">534 U. S. 112</a>, 122 (2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).  A judicial warrant and probable cause are not needed where the search or seizure is justified by \xe2\x80\x9cspecial needs, beyond the normal need for law enforcement,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the need to deter drug use in public schools, <em>Vernonia School Dist. 47J</em> v. <em>Acton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/515/646/index.html">515 U. S. 646</a>, 653 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted), or the need to assure that railroad employees engaged in train operations are not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, <em>Skinner</em> v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/602/index.html">489 U. S. 602</a> (1989); and where the search or seizure is in execution of an administrative warrant authorizing, for example, an inspection of fire-damaged premises to determine the cause, <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Clifford</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/464/287/index.html">464 U. S. 287</a>, 294 (1984) (plurality opinion), or an inspection of residential premises to assure compliance with a housing code, <em>Camara</em> v. <em>Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/index.html">387 U. S. 523</a>, 535\xe2\x80\x93538 (1967).  But those exceptions do not apply where the officer\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is not to attend to the special needs or to the investigation for which the administrative inspection is justified.  See <em>Whren</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 811\xe2\x80\x93812.  The Government seeks to justify the present arrest on the basis of a properly issued judicial warrant\xe2\x80\x94so that the special-needs and administrative-inspection cases cannot be the basis for a purpose inquiry here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Apart from those cases, we have almost uniformly rejected invitations to probe subjective intent.  See <em>Brigham City</em> v. <em>Stuart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/547/398/index.html">547 U. S. 398</a>, 404 (2006).  There is one category of exception, upon which the Court of Appeals principally relied.  In <em>Edmond</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/32/index.html">531 U. S. 32</a>, we held that the Fourth Amendment could not condone suspicionless vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of detecting illegal narcotics.  Although we had previously approved vehicle checkpoints set up for the purpose of keeping off the road unlicensed drivers, <em>Delaware</em> v. <em>Prouse</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/648/index.html">440 U. S. 648</a>, 663 (1979), or alcohol-impaired drivers, <em>Michigan Dept. of State Police</em> v. <em>Sitz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/444/index.html">496 U. S. 444</a> (1990); and for the purpose of interdicting those who illegally cross the border, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Martinez-Fuerte</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/428/543/index.html">428 U. S. 543</a> (1976); we found the drug-detection purpose in <em>Edmond </em>invalidating because it was \xe2\x80\x9cultimately indistinguishable from the general interest in crime control,\xe2\x80\x9d 531 U. S.<em>,</em> at 44.  In the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view, <em>Edmond </em>established that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98programmatic purpose\xe2\x80\x99 is relevant to Fourth Amendment analysis of programs of seizures without probable cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 968.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 That was mistaken.  It was not the absence of probable cause that triggered the invalidating-purpose inquiry in <em>Edmond</em>.  To the contrary, <em>Edmond </em>explicitly said that it would approve checkpoint stops for \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral crime control purposes\xe2\x80\x9d that were based upon merely \xe2\x80\x9csome quantum of individualized suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 47.  Purpose was relevant in <em>Edmond </em>because \xe2\x80\x9cprogrammatic purposes may be relevant to the validity of Fourth Amendment intrusions undertaken <em>pursuant to a general scheme without individualized suspicion</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 45\xe2\x80\x9346 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Needless to say, warrantless, \xe2\x80\x9csuspicionless intrusions pursuant to a general scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 47, are far removed from the facts of this case.  A warrant issued by a neutral Magistrate Judge authorized al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  The affidavit accompanying the warrant application (as al-Kidd concedes) gave individualized reasons to believe that he was a material witness and that he would soon disappear.  The existence of a judicial warrant based on individualized suspicion takes this case outside the domain of not only our special-needs and administrative-search cases, but of <em>Edmond </em>as well.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A warrant based on individualized suspicion[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] in fact grants more protection against the malevolent and the incompetent than existed in most of our cases eschewing inquiries into intent.  In <em>Whren</em>, 517 U. S., at 813, and <em>Devenpeck</em>, 543 U. S., at 153, we declined to probe the motives behind seizures supported by probable cause but lacking a warrant approved by a detached magistrate.  <em>Terry</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/392/1/index.html">392 U. S. 1</a>, 21\xe2\x80\x9322 (1968), and <em>Knights</em>, 534 U. S., at 121\xe2\x80\x93122, applied an objective standard to warrantless searches justified by a lesser showing of reasonable suspicion.  We review even some suspicionless searches for objective reasonableness.  See <em>Bond</em>, 529 U. S., at 335\xe2\x80\x93336, 338, n.\xc2\xa02.  If concerns about improper motives and pretext do not justify subjective inquiries in those less protective contexts, we see no reason to adopt that inquiry here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Al-Kidd would read our cases more narrowly.  He asserts that <em>Whren</em> establishes that we ignore subjective intent only when there exists \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d 517 U. S.<em>,</em> at 811\xe2\x80\x94which was not the case here.  That is a distortion of <em>Whren</em>.  Our unanimous opinion held that we would not look\nbehind an objectively reasonable traffic stop to determine whether racial profiling or a desire to investigate other potential crimes was the real motive.  See <em>id.,</em> at 810, 813.  In the course of our analysis, we dismissed Whren\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on our inventory-search and administrative-inspection cases by explaining that those cases do not \xe2\x80\x9cendors[e] the principle that ulterior motives can invalidate police conduct that is justifiable on the basis of probable cause to believe that a violation of law has occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 811  But to say that ulterior motives do <em>not</em> in-validate a search that is legitimate because of probable cause to believe a crime has occurred is not to say that it <em>does </em>invalidate all searches that are legitimate for other reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nly an undiscerning reader,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, would think otherwise.  We referred to probable cause to believe that a violation of law had occurred because that was the legitimating factor in the case at hand.  But the analysis of\nour opinion swept broadly to reject inquiries into motive generally.  See <em>id.,</em> at 812\xe2\x80\x93815.  We remarked that our special-needs and administrative-inspection cases are un-usual in their concern for pretext, and do nothing more than \xe2\x80\x9cexplain that the exemption from the need for probable cause (and warrant), which is accorded to searches made for the purpose of inventory or administrative regulation, is not accorded to searches that are <em>not</em> made for those purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 811\xe2\x80\x93812.  And our opinion emphasized that we had at that time (prior to <em>Edmond</em>) rejected every request to examine subjective intent outside the narrow context of special needs and administrative inspections.  See 517 U. S.<em>,</em> at 812.  Thus, al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s approach adds an \xe2\x80\x9conly\xe2\x80\x9d to a sentence plucked from the <em>Whren </em>opinion, and then elevates that sentence (as so revised) over the remainder of the opinion, and over the consistent holdings of our other cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because al-Kidd concedes that individualized suspicion supported the issuance of the material-witness arrest warrant; and does not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant; we find no Fourth Amendment violation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Efficient[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] and evenhanded application of the law demands that we look to whether the arrest is objectively justified, rather than to the motive of the arresting officer.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Government official\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violates clearly established law when, at the time of the challenged conduct, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he contours of [a] right [are] sufficiently clear\xe2\x80\x9d that every \xe2\x80\x9creasonable official would have understood that what he is doing violates that right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U.

A district-court opinion had suggested, in a footnoted dictum devoid of supporting citation, that using such a warrant for preventive detention of suspects \xe2\x80\x9cis an illegitimate use of the statute\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94implying (we accept for the sake of argument) that the detention would therefore be unconstitutional.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Awadallah</em>, 202 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 55, 77, n.\xc2\xa028 (SDNY 2002).  The Court of Appeals thought nothing could \xe2\x80\x9chave given John Ashcroft fair[er] warning\xe2\x80\x9d that his conduct violated the Fourth Amendment, because the footnoted dictum \xe2\x80\x9c<em>call[ed] out Ashcroft by name</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em>!</em>  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 972\xe2\x80\x93973 (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added).  We will indulge the assumption (though it does not seem to us realistic) that Justice Department lawyers bring to the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s personal attention all district judges\xe2\x80\x99 footnoted speculations that boldly \xe2\x80\x9ccall him out by name.\xe2\x80\x9d  On that assumption, would it prove that for him (and for him only?) it became clearly established that pretextual use of the material-witness statute rendered the arrest unconstitutional?  An extraordinary proposition.  Even a district judge\xe2\x80\x99s <em>ipse dixit</em> of a holding is not \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolling authority\xe2\x80\x9d in any jurisdiction, much less in the entire United States; and his <em>ipse dixit </em>of a footnoted dictum falls far short of what is necessary absent controlling authority: a robust \xe2\x80\x9cconsensus of cases of persuasive authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U.

And the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 reference to those cases here makes the same error of assuming that purpose is only disregarded when there is probable cause to suspect a violation of law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also found clearly established law lurking in the broad \xe2\x80\x9chistory and purposes of the Fourth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 971.  We have repeatedly told courts\xe2\x80\x94and the Ninth Circuit in particular, see <em>Brosseau</em> v. <em>Haugen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/194/index.html">543 U. S. 194</a>, 198\xe2\x80\x93199 (2004) <em>(per curiam)</em>\xe2\x80\x94not to define clearly established law at a high level of generality.  See also, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Wilson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 615; <em>Anderson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 639\xe2\x80\x93640; cf. <em>Sawyer</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/227/index.html">497 U. S. 227</a>, 236 (1990).  The general proposition, for example, that an unreasonable search or seizure violates the Fourth Amendment is of little help in determining whether the violative nature of particular conduct is clearly established.  See <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a>, 201\xe2\x80\x93202 (2001); <em>Wilson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 615.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same is true of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 broad historical assertions.  The Fourth Amendment was a response to the English Crown\xe2\x80\x99s use of general warrants, which often allowed royal officials to search and seize whatever and whomever they pleased while investigating crimes or affronts to the Crown.  See <em>Stanford</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/379/476/index.html">379 U. S. 476</a>, 481\xe2\x80\x93485 (1965).  According to the Court of Appeals, Ashcroft should have seen that a pretextual warrant similarly \xe2\x80\x9cgut[s] the substantive protections of the Fourth Amendmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d and allows the State \xe2\x80\x9cto arrest upon the executive\xe2\x80\x99s mere suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  580 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 972.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ashcroft must be forgiven for missing the parallel, which escapes us as well.  The principal evil of the general warrant was addressed by the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s particularity requirement, <em>Stanford</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 485, which Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s alleged policy made no effort to evade.  The warrant authorizing al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s arrest named al-Kidd and only al-Kidd.  It might be argued, perhaps, that when, in response to the English abuses, the Fourth Amendment said that warrants could only issue \xe2\x80\x9con probable cause\xe2\x80\x9d it meant only probable cause to suspect a violation of law, and not probable cause to believe that the individual named in the warrant was a material witness.  But that would make <em>all</em> arrests pursuant to material-witness warrants unconstitutional, whether pretextual or not\xe2\x80\x94and that is not the position taken by al-Kidd in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While featuring a District Court\xe2\x80\x99s footnoted dictum, the Court of Appeals made no mention of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s affirmation in <em>Edmond </em>of the \xe2\x80\x9cpredominan[t]\xe2\x80\x9d rule that reasonableness is an objective inquiry, 531 U. S., at 47.  Nor did it mention <em>Whren</em>\xe2\x80\x99s and <em>Knights</em>\xe2\x80\x99 statements that subjective intent mattered in a very limited subset of our Fourth Amendment cases; or <em>Terry</em>\xe2\x80\x99s objective evaluation of investigatory searches premised on reasonable suspicion rather than probable cause; or <em>Bond</em>\xe2\x80\x99s objective evaluation of a suspicionless investigatory search.  The Court of Appeals seems to have cherry-picked the aspects of our opinions that gave colorable support to the proposition that the unconstitutionality of the action here was clearly established.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Qualified immunity gives government officials breathing room to make reasonable but mistaken judgments about open legal questions.  When properly applied, it protects \xe2\x80\x9call but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Malley</em>, 475 U. S., at 341.  Ashcroft deserves neither label, not least because eight Court of Appeals judges agreed with his judgment in a case of first impression.  See <em>Wilson</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 618.  He deserves qualified immunity even assuming\xe2\x80\x94contrafactually\xe2\x80\x94that his alleged detention policy violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that an objectively reasonable arrest and detention of a material witness pursuant to a validly obtained warrant cannot be challenged as unconstitutional on the basis of allegations that the arresting authority had an improper motive.  Because Ashcroft did not violate clearly established law, we need not address the more difficult question whether he enjoys absolute immunity.  The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kagan took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals also relied upon <em>Ferguson </em>v. <em>Charleston</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/67/index.html">532 U.

We disagree.  No usage of the word is more common and idiomatic than a statement such as \xe2\x80\x9cI have a suspicion he knows something about the crime,\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9cI have a suspicion she is throwing me a surprise birthday party.\xe2\x80\x9d  The many cases cited by Justice Ginsburg, <em>post,</em> at 3, n.\xc2\xa02, which use the neutral word \xe2\x80\x9csuspicion\xe2\x80\x9d <em>in connection with</em> wrongdoing, prove nothing except that searches and seizures for reasons other than suspected wrongdoing are rare.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The concerns of Justices Ginsburg and Sotomayor about the validity of the warrant in this case are beside the point.  See <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment); <em>post</em>, at 2 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment).<em> </em>The validity of the warrant is not <em>our </em>\xe2\x80\x9copening assumption,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 2 (Ginsburg, J., concurring in judgment); it is the premise of al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  Al-Kidd does not claim that Ashcroft is liable because the FBI agents failed to obtain a valid warrant.  He takes the validity of the warrant as a given, and argues that his arrest nevertheless violated the Constitution because it was motivated by an illegitimate purpose.  His separate Fourth Amendment and statutory claims against the FBI agents who sought the material-witness warrant, which are the focus of both concurrences, are not before us.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0We may note in passing that al-Kidd alleges that the Attorney General authorized the use of material-witness warrants for detention of suspected terrorists, but not that he forbade the use of those warrants to detain material witnesses.  Which means that if al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into actual motive is accepted, mere determination that the Attorney General promulgated the alleged policy would not alone decide the case.  Al-Kidd would also have to prove that the officials who sought his material-arrest warrant were motivated by Ashcroft\xe2\x80\x99s policy, not by a desire to call al-Kidd as a witness.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963559">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nKENNEDY, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nASHCROFT V.

ASHCROFT, PETITIONER <em>v. </em>ABDULLAH\nal-KIDD</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">[May 31, 2011]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Kennedy, with whom Justice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join as to Part I, concurring.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I join the opinion of the Court in full.  In holding that the Attorney General could be liable for damages based on an unprecedented constitutional rule, the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit disregarded the purposes of the doc-trine of qualified immunity.  This concurring opinion makes two additional observations.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is limited to the arguments presented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Material Witness Statute in this case was lawful.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (noting that al-Kidd \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not assert that his arrest would have been unconstitutional absent the alleged pretextual use of the warrant\xe2\x80\x9d).  Under the statute, a Magistrate Judge may issue a warrant to arrest someone as a material witness upon a showing by affidavit that \xe2\x80\x9cthe testimony of a person is material in a criminal proceeding\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthat it may become impracticable to secure the presence of the person by subpoena.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73144.  The scope of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s lawful \nauthorization is uncertain.  For example, a law-abiding citizen might observe a crime during the days or weeks before a scheduled flight abroad.  It is unclear whether those facts alone might allow police to obtain a material witness warrant on the ground that it \xe2\x80\x9cmay become impracticable\xe2\x80\x9d to secure the person\xe2\x80\x99s presence by subpoena.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The question becomes more difficult if one further assumes the traveler would be willing to testify if asked; and more difficult still if one supposes that authorities delay obtaining or executing the warrant until the traveler has arrived at the airport.  These possibilities resemble the facts in this case.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In considering these issues, it is important to bear in mind that the Material Witness Statute might not provide for the issuance of warrants within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Warrant Clause.  The typical arrest warrant is based on probable cause that the arrestee has committed a crime; but that is not the standard for the issuance of warrants under the Material Witness Statute.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11 (reserving the possibility that probable cause for purposes of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Warrant Clause means \xe2\x80\x9conly probable cause to suspect a violation of law\xe2\x80\x9d).  If material witness warrants do not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cWarrants\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fourth Amendment, then material witness arrests might still be governed by the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s separate reasonableness requirement for seizures of the person.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Watson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/423/411/index.html">423 U. S. 411</a> (1976).  Given the difficulty of these issues, the Court is correct to address only the legal theory put before it, without further exploring when material witness arrests might be consistent with statutory and constitutional requirements.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that the Attorney General holds a high office in the Government must inform what law is clearly established for the purposes of this case.  <em>Mitchell</em> v. <em>Forsyth</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/511/index.html">472 U. S. 511</a>, 525 (1985).  Some federal officers perform their functions in a single jurisdiction, say within the con-fines of one State or one federal judicial district.  They \xe2\x80\x9creasonably can anticipate when their conduct may give rise to liability for damages\xe2\x80\x9d and so are expected to adjust their behavior in accordance with local precedent.  <em>Davis</em> v. <em>Scherer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/183/index.html">468 U. S. 183</a>, 195 (1984); see also <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 639\xe2\x80\x93640 (1987).  In contrast the Attorney General occupies a national office and so sets policies implemented in many jurisdictions throughout the country.  The official with responsibilities in many jurisdictions may face ambiguous and sometimes inconsistent sources of decisional law.  While it may be clear that one Court of Appeals has approved a certain course of conduct, other Courts of Appeals may have disapproved it, or at least reserved the issue.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When faced with inconsistent legal rules in different jurisdictions, national officeholders should be given some deference for qualified immunity purposes, at least if they implement policies consistent with the governing law of the jurisdiction where the action is taken.  As we have explained, qualified immunity is lost when plaintiffs point either to \xe2\x80\x9ccases of controlling authority in their jurisdiction at the time of the incident\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9ca consensus of cases of persuasive authority such that a reasonable officer could not have believed that his actions were lawful.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U. S. 603</a>, 617 (1999); see also <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  These standards ensure the officer has \xe2\x80\x9cfair and clear warning\xe2\x80\x9d of what the Constitution requires.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lanier</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/259/index.html">520 U. S. 259</a>, 271 (1997).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A national officeholder intent on retaining qualified immunity need not abide by the most stringent standard adopted anywhere in the United States.  And the national officeholder need not guess at when a relatively small set of appellate precedents have established a binding legal rule.  If national officeholders were subject to personal liability whenever they confronted disagreement among appellate courts, those officers would be deterred from full use of their legal authority.  The consequences of that deterrence must counsel caution by the Judicial Branch, particularly in the area of national security.  See <em>Ashcroft</em> v. <em>Iqbal</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 21).  Furthermore, too expansive a view of \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d would risk giving local judicial determinations the effect of rules with <em>de facto</em> national significance, contrary to the normal process of ordered appellate review.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proceedings in this case illustrate these concerns.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit appears to have reasoned that a Federal District Court sitting in New York had authority to establish a legal rule binding on \nthe Attorney General and, therefore, on federal law-enforcement operations conducted nationwide.  See 580 F.\xc2\xa03d 949, 972\xe2\x80\x93973 (2009).  Indeed, this case involves a material witness warrant issued in Boise, Idaho, and an arrest near Washington, D.\xc2\xa0C.  Of course, district court decisions are not precedential to this extent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.<em> </em>But nationwide security operations should not have to grind to a halt even when an appellate court finds those operations unconstitutional.  The doctrine of qualified immunity does not so constrain national officeholders entrusted with urgent responsibilities.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963558">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n563 U.

Based on those allegations, it is not at all clear that it would have been \xe2\x80\x9cimpracticable to secure [al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s] presence \xe2\x80\xa6 by subpoena\xe2\x80\x9d or that his testimony could not \xe2\x80\x9cadequately be secured by deposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73144; see First Amended Complaint in No. 05\xe2\x80\x93093\xe2\x80\x93EJL, \xc2\xb655, App. 26 (\xe2\x80\x9cMr. al-Kidd would have complied with a subpoena had he been issued one or agreed to a deposition\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nor is it clear that the affidavit supporting the warrant was sufficient; its failure to disclose that the Government had no intention of using al-Kidd as a witness at trial may very well have rendered the affidavit deliberately false and misleading.  Cf. <em>Franks</em> v. <em>Delaware</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/154/index.html">438 U. S. 154</a>, 155\xe2\x80\x93156 (1978).  The majority assumes away these factual difficulties, but in my view, they point to the artificiality of the way the Fourth Amendment question has been presented to this Court and provide further reason to avoid rendering an unnecessary holding on the constitutional question.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also join Part I of Justice Kennedy\xe2\x80\x99s concurring opinion.  As that opinion makes clear, this case does not present an occasion to address the proper scope of the material witness statute or its constitutionality as applied in this case.  Indeed, nothing in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion today should be read as placing this Court\xe2\x80\x99s imprimatur on the actions taken by the Government against al-Kidd.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding is limited to the arguments presented by the parties and leaves unresolved whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Material Witness Statute in this case was lawful\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1963557">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nGINSBURG, J., CONCURRING IN JUDGMENT<br/>\nASHCROFT V.

Given <em>Whren</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html"></a><a href="/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a> (1996), I agree with the Court that no \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established law\xe2\x80\x9d renders Ashcroft answerable in damages for the abuse of authority al-Kidd charged.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  But I join Justice Sotomayor in objecting to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition of al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment claim on the merits; as she observes, <em>post</em>, at 1 (opinion concurring in judgment), that claim involves novel and trying questions that will \xe2\x80\x9chave no effect on the outcome of th[is] case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Pearson</em> v. <em>Callahan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/223/index.html">555 U. S. 223</a>, 236\xe2\x80\x93237 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addressing al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment claim against Ashcroft, the Court assumes at the outset the existence of a <em>validly obtained</em> material witness warrant.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1, 12.  That characterization is puzzling.  See <em>post</em>, at 2 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Is a warrant \xe2\x80\x9cvalidly obtained\xe2\x80\x9d when the affidavit on which it is based fails to inform the issuing Magistrate Judge that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has no intention of using [al-Kidd as a witness] at [another\xe2\x80\x99s] trial,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 1, and does not disclose that al-Kidd had cooperated with FBI agents each of the several times they had asked to interview him, App. 26?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Casting further doubt on the assumption that the warrant was validly obtained, the Magistrate Judge was not told that al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s parents, wife, and children were all citizens and residents of the United States.  In addition, the affidavit misrepresented that al-Kidd was about to take a one-way flight to Saudi Arabia, with a first-class ticket costing approximately $5,000; in fact, al-Kidd had a round-trip, coach-class ticket that cost $1,700.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Given these omissions and misrepresentations, there is strong cause to question the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opening assumption\xe2\x80\x94a valid material-witness warrant\xe2\x80\x94and equally strong reason to conclude that a merits determination was neither necessary nor proper.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I also agree with Justice Kennedy that al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s treatment presents serious questions, unaddressed by the Court, concerning \xe2\x80\x9cthe [legality of] the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of the Material Witness Statute in this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion).  In addition to the questions Justice Kennedy poses, and even if the initial material witness classification had been proper, what even arguably legitimate basis could there be for the harsh custodial conditions to which al-Kidd was subjected: Ostensibly held only to secure his testimony, al-Kidd was confined in three different detention centers during his 16 days\xe2\x80\x99 incarceration, kept in high-security cells lit 24 hours a day, strip-searched and subjected to body-cavity inspections on more than one occasion, and handcuffed and shackled about his wrists, legs, and waist.

But it would be difficult to conceive of a situation where conditions so harsh, employed to achieve objectives that could be accomplished in so many alternative and less harsh methods, would not support a conclusion that the purpose for which they were imposed was to punish.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However circumscribed al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Bivens</em> claim against Ashcroft may have been, see <em>Bivens</em> v. <em>Six Unknown Fed.

But his ordeal is a grim reminder of the need to install safeguards against disrespect for human dignity, constraints that will control officialdom even in perilous times.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Nowhere in al-Kidd\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is there any concession that the warrant gained by the FBI agents was validly obtained.

As to impracticability, the affidavit contained only this unelaborated statement: \xe2\x80\x9cIt is believed that if Al-Kidd travels to Saudi Arabia, the United States Government will be unable to secure his presence at trial via subpoena.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 64.

The word \xe2\x80\x9csuspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d however, ordinarily indicates that the person suspected has engaged in wrongdoing.
