One of the claims was that three of the petitioners had engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate and threaten various potential material witnesses in order to prevent them from testifying "freely, fully and truthfully" in the action, in violation of the first part of 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1985(2) (1976 ed., Supp. V).  The District Court dismissed the entire complaint.  The Court of Appeals, while affirming the dismissal of certain of respondent\'s claims and remanding as to others, reversed with respect to the claim at issue.  The court concluded that respondent\'s claims of witness intimidation, insofar as they related to obstruction of justice at the state level, were not actionable under the second part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2) -- which prohibits a conspiracy to obstruct the due course of justice in a State "with intent to deny any citizen the equal protection of the laws" -- because there was no sufficient allegation of racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory animus.

Petitioners argue that the action must be dismissed because there is no claim that the conspiracy was motivated by the kind of "racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" we held to be necessary in <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html">403 U.

In both federal and state tribunals, respondent Rutledge has asserted a variety of common law and statutory claims against Arizona State University and its officials arising out of incidents that occurred while he was a member of the University\'s football squad.  One of his claims is that three of the petitioners -- the Arizona State University athletic director, head football coach, and assistant football coach -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="721">Page 460 U. S. 721</a></p><p> engaged in a conspiracy to intimidate and threaten various potential material witnesses in order to prevent them from testifying "freely, fully and truthfully" in his lawsuit in federal court. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court granted a motion to dismiss the entire complaint on the grounds that the action was barred by the Eleventh Amendment and that respondent had failed to allege </p><p><a class="page-number" name="722">Page 460 U. S. 722</a></p><p> a violation of his civil rights.  It concluded that respondent had failed to state a \xc2\xa7 1985 claim because he had not shown that he was a member of an identifiable class, and because his general allegations of a conspiracy were unsupported by specific facts.  App. to Pet. for Cert. A-2.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the dismissal of all claims against the University and its Board of Regents and of the vicarious liability claims against petitioner Miller, remanded for further proceedings on the other state law tort claims against petitioners, and affirmed the dismissal of all federal civil rights claims against petitioners except the one at issue here.  <em>Rutledge v. Arizona Bd. of Regents,</em> 660 F.2d 1345 (CA9 1981). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals construed respondent\'s allegations of witness intimidation, <em>see</em> <a href="#F1" name="T1">n</a> 1, <em>supra,</em> as containing two components -- obstruction of justice at the state level, and interference with federal litigation.  The former was not actionable under the second part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2), [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] the court held, because "there exists no sufficient allegation of racial or class-based invidiously discriminatory animus."  660 F.2d at 1355.  The court acknowledged that this Court\'s decision in <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge, supra,</em> had interpreted a portion of \xc2\xa7 1985(3) to include such a requirement in order to avoid the constitutional issues that would have attended enactment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="723">Page 460 U. S. 723</a></p><p> of a general federal tort law.  It decided that the same principles applied to claims based on private conspiracies to obstruct justice in state court proceedings.</p>\n<p>But the Court of Appeals concluded that no allegations of class-based animus were required under the first part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2), which proscribes intimidation of witnesses in the federal courts. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  It relied on the plain language of the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and on the legislative history.  Noting the Federal Government\'s unquestioned constitutional authority to protect the processes of its own courts, and the absence of any need to limit the first part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2) to avoid creating a general federal tort law, the Court of Appeals declined to impose the limitation set forth in <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge.</em>  660 F.2d at 1355.</p>\n<p>Because other Circuits have read the first part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2) more narrowly, <em>see Kimble v. D. J. McDuffy, Inc.,</em> 648 F.2d 340, 346-348 (CA5) (en banc), <em>cert. denied,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/454/1110/case.html">454 U.

As have the Courts of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, <em>McCord v. Bailey,</em> 204 U.S.App.D.C. 334, 345, 636 F.2d 606, 616 (1980), <em>cert. denied,</em> 451 U.S. 983 (1981), and the Third Circuit, <em>Brawer v. Horowitz,</em> 535 F.2d 830, 840 (1976), we agree with the Ninth Circuit\'s analysis. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="724">Page 460 U. S. 724</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The statutory provision that is now codified as \xc2\xa7 1985 of Title 42 of the United States Code was originally enacted as \xc2\xa7 2 of the Civil Rights Act of 1871, 17 Stat. 13.  The length and style of \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1871 Act, reprinted in full as an <l=|460 719app|="" u.s.="">Appendix to this opinion, make it somewhat difficult to parse.  Nevertheless, if its several components are carefully identified, its meaning becomes clear.</l=|460></p>\n<p>Although \xc2\xa7 2 contained only one long paragraph when it was originally enacted, that single paragraph outlawed five broad classes of conspiratorial activity.  In general terms, \xc2\xa7 2 proscribed conspiracies that interfere with (a) the performance of official duties by federal officers; (b) the administration of justice in federal courts; (c) the administration of justice in state courts; (d) the private enjoyment of "equal protection of the laws" and "equal privileges and immunities under the laws"; and (e) the right to support candidates in federal elections.  As now codified in \xc2\xa7 1985, the long paragraph is divided into three subsections.  One of the five classes of prohibited conspiracy is proscribed by \xc2\xa7 1985(1), two by \xc2\xa7 1985(2), and two by \xc2\xa7 1985(3).  The civil remedy for a violation of any of the subsections is found at the end of \xc2\xa7 1985(3).  The reclassification was not intended to change the substantive meaning of the 1871 Act. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Three of the five broad categories, the first two and the fifth, relate to institutions and processes of the Federal Government -- federal officers, \xc2\xa7 1985(1); federal judicial proceedings, the first portion of \xc2\xa7 1985(2); and federal elections, the second part of \xc2\xa7 1985(3).  The statutory provisions dealing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="725">Page 460 U. S. 725</a></p><p> with these categories of conspiratorial activity contain no language requiring that the conspirators act with intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.  Nor was such language found in the corresponding portions of \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1871 Act.  <em>See</em> Appendix to this opinion. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>The remaining two categories, however, encompass underlying activity that is not institutionally linked to federal interests, and that is usually of primary state concern.  The second part of \xc2\xa7 1985(2) applies to conspiracies to obstruct the course of justice in state courts, and the first part of \xc2\xa7 1985(3) provides a cause of action against two or more persons who "conspire or go in disguise on the highway or on the premises of another." [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Each of these portions of the statute contains language requiring that the conspirators\' actions be motivated by an intent to deprive their victims of the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p>This limiting language was construed in <em>Griffin v. Breckenridge,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html">403 U. S. 88</a></span> (1971), a case in which a unanimous Court held that \xc2\xa7 1985(3) applies to purely private conspiracies.  In explaining why that holding would not create an open-ended federal tort law applicable "to all tortious, conspiratorial interferences with the rights of others," <em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html#101">403 U. S. 101</a></span>, we expressly stated: </p><p><a class="page-number" name="726">Page 460 U. S. 726</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"The language requiring intent to deprive of <em>equal</em> protection, or <em>equal</em> privileges and immunities, means that there must be some racial, or perhaps otherwise class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus behind the conspirators\' action.  The conspiracy, in other words, must aim at a deprivation of the equal enjoyment of rights secured by the law to all."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html#102">403 U. S. 102</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Although <em>Griffin</em> itself arose under the first clause of \xc2\xa7 1985(3), petitioners argue that its reasoning should be applied to the remaining portions of \xc2\xa7 1985 as well.  We cannot accept that argument for three reasons.  First, the scope of the <em>Griffin</em> opinion is carefully confined to "the portion of \xc2\xa7 1985(3) now before us," <em>id.</em> at 99; <em>see also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html#102">403 U. S. 102</a></span>, n. 9.  There is no suggestion in the opinion that its reasoning applies to any other portion of \xc2\xa7 1985.  Second, the analysis in the <em>Griffin</em> opinion relied heavily on the fact that the sponsors of the 1871 bill added the "equal protection" language in response to objections that the "enormous sweep of the original language" vastly extended federal authority and displaced state control over private conduct.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/88/case.html#99">403 U. S. 99</a></span>-100.  That legislative background does not apply to the portions of the statute that prohibit interference with federal officers, federal courts, or federal elections.  Third, and of greatest importance, the statutory language that provides the textual basis for the "class-based, invidiously discriminatory animus" requirement simply does not appear in the portion of the statute that applies to this case.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F4" name="T4">n</a> 4, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>Given the structure of \xc2\xa7 2 of the 1871 Act, it is clear that Congress did not intend to impose a requirement of class-based animus on persons seeking to prove a violation of their rights under the first clause of \xc2\xa7 1985(2). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The legislative </p><p><a class="page-number" name="727">Page 460 U. S. 727</a></p><p> history supports the conclusion we have drawn from the language of the statute.  Protection of the processes of the federal courts was an essential component of Congress\' solution to disorder and anarchy in the Southern States.  Neither proponents nor opponents of the bill had any doubt that the Constitution gave Congress the power to prohibit intimidation of parties, witnesses, and jurors in federal courts.

The Court of Appeals recognized that whether respondent had "adequately alleged a claim under the first part of section 1985(2) is a close question," but decided it in the affirmative.  <em>Rutledge v. Arizona Bd. of Regents,</em> 660 F.2d 1345, 1355 (CA9 1981).  Under the liberal pleading rules of <em>Conley v. Gibson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/case.html">355 U. S. 41</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/355/41/case.html#47">355 U.

On information and belief, since the time of filing the statutorily mandated claim with the Arizona Board of Regents, defendants Kush, Miller and Horton have conspired for the purpose of hindering or obstructing the due course of justice with an intent to deny the plaintiff equal protection of the laws by threatening and intimidating potential material witnesses, to prevent the plaintiff from lawfully enforcing his rights and to \'cover up\' the wrongful acts of defendants Kush and Maskill."</p>\n<p>App. to Pet. for Cert. E-11 to E-12.</p>\n<p>These allegations might appear to describe only a conspiracy to interfere with potential witnesses before the Arizona Board of Regents.
