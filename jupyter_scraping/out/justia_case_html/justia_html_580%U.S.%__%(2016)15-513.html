Respondents Cori and Kerri Rigsby, former claims adjusters for one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contractors, E. A. Renfroe &amp; Co., filed a complaint under seal in April 2006, claiming that petitioner instructed them and other adjusters to misclassify wind damage as flood damage in order to shift petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s insurance liability to the Government.  The District Court extended the length of the seal several times at the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request, but lifted the seal in part in January 2007, allowing disclosure of the action to another District Court hearing a suit by E. A. Renfroe against respondents.  In August 2007, the District Court lifted the seal in full.  The Government subsequently declined to intervene.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Petitioner moved to dismiss the suit on the grounds that respondents had violated the seal requirement.  Specifically, it alleged, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 former attorney had disclosed the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s existence to several news outlets, which issued stories about the fraud allegations, but did not mention the existence of the FCA complaint; and respondents had met with a Congressman who later spoke out against the purported fraud.  The District Court applied the test for dismissal set out in <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Lujan </i>v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.</i>, 67 F.\xc2\xa03d 242, 245\xe2\x80\x93247.  Balancing three factors\xe2\x80\x94actual harm to the Government, severity of the violations, and evidence of bad faith\xe2\x80\x94the court decided against dismissal.  Petitioner did not request a lesser sanction.  The Fifth Circuit affirmed.  It first concluded that a seal violation does not require mandatory dismissal of a relator\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  It then considered the same factors weighed by the District Court and reached a similar conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0A seal violation does not mandate dismissal of a relator\xe2\x80\x99s complaint.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The FCA does not enact so harsh a rule.  Section 3730(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a complaint \xe2\x80\x9cshall\xe2\x80\x9d be kept under seal is a mandatory rule for relators.  But the statute says nothing about the remedy for violating that rule; and absent congressional guidance regarding a remedy, \xe2\x80\x9cthe sanction for breach [of a mandatory duty] is not loss of all later powers to act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Montalvo-Murillo</i>,\n\n495 U.\xc2\xa0S. 711\n.  The FCA\xe2\x80\x99s structure supports this result.  The FCA has a number of provisions requiring, in express terms, the dismissal of a relator\xe2\x80\x99s action.  <i>E.g</i>., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(b)(5), (e)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(2).  It is thus proper to infer that Congress did not intend to require dismissal for a violation of the seal requirement.  See <i>Marx</i> v. <i>General Revenue Corp.</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  This result is also consistent with the general purpose of \xc2\xa73730(b)(2), which was enacted as part of a set of reforms meant to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage more private enforcement suits,\xe2\x80\x9d S.\xc2\xa0Rep.

There is no textual indication that Congress conditioned the authority to file a private right of action on compliance with the seal requirement or that the relator\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring suit depends on adherence to the seal requirement.  And the Senate Committee Report\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s general purpose is best understood to support respondents rather than a mandatory dismissal rule.  Moreover, because the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure are clear, there is no need to accept petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to consider a few stray sentences from the legislative history.

First, do any and all violations of the seal requirement mandate dismissal of a private party\xe2\x80\x99s complaint with prejudice?  Second, if dismissal is not mandatory, did the District Court here abuse its discretion by declining to dismiss respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint?</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The FCA imposes civil liability on an individual who, <i>inter alia</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly presents .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval\xe2\x80\x9d to the Federal Government.  \xc2\xa73729(a)(1)(A).  Almost unique to the FCA are its <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam</i> enforcement provisions, which allow a private party known as a \xe2\x80\x9crelator\xe2\x80\x9d to bring an FCA<i> </i>action on behalf of the Government.  \xc2\xa73730(b)(1); <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel.

In the years before Hurricane Katrina, petitioner issued two types of homeowner-insurance policies that are relevant in this case: (1) Federal Government-backed flood insurance policies and (2) petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own general homeowner insurance policies.  The practical effect for homeowners who were affected by Hurricane Katrina and who purchased both policies was that petitioner would be responsible for paying for wind damage, while the Government would pay for flood damage.  As the Court of Appeals noted, this arrangement created a potential conflict of interest: Petitioner had \xe2\x80\x9can incentive to classify hurricane damage as flood-related to limit its economic exposure.\xe2\x80\x9d  794 F.\xc2\xa03d 457, 462 (CA5 2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents Cori and Kerri Rigsby are former claims adjusters for one of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contractors, E. A. Renfroe &amp; Co.  Together with other adjusters, they were responsible for visiting the damaged homes of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s customers to determine the extent to which a homeowner was entitled to an insurance payout.  According to respondents, petitioner instructed them and other adjusters to misclassify wind damage as flood damage in order to shift petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s insurance liability to the Government.  See <i>id.,</i> at 463\xe2\x80\x93464 (summarizing trial evidence).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In April 2006, respondents filed their <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam</i> complaint under seal.  At the Government\xe2\x80\x99s request, the District Court extended the length of the seal a number of times.  In January 2007, the court lifted the seal in part, allowing disclosure of the <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam </i>action to another District Court hearing a suit by E. A. Renfroe against respondents for purported misappropriation of documents related to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s alleged fraud.  See <i>E. A. Renfroe &amp; Co. </i>v. <i>Moran</i>, No. 2:06\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x931752 (ND Ala.).  In August 2007, the District Court lifted the seal in full.  In January 2008, the Government declined to intervene.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In January 2011, petitioner moved to dismiss respondents\xe2\x80\x99 suit on the grounds that they had violated the seal requirement.  The parties do not dispute the essential background.  In the months before the seal was lifted in part, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 then-attorney, one Dickie Scruggs, e-mailed a sealed evidentiary filing that disclosed the complaint\xe2\x80\x99s existence to journalists at ABC, the Associated Press, and the New York Times.  All three outlets issued stories discussing the fraud allegations, but none revealed the existence of the FCA complaint.  Respondents themselves met with Mississippi Congressman Gene Taylor, who later spoke out in public against petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s purported fraud, although he did not mention the existence of the FCA suit at that time.  After the seal was lifted in part, Scruggs disclosed the existence of the suit to various others, including a public relations firm and CBS News.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the time of the motion to dismiss in 2011, respondents were represented neither by Scruggs nor by any of the attorneys who had worked with him.  In March 2008, Scruggs withdrew from respondents\xe2\x80\x99 case after he was indicted for attempting to bribe a state-court judge.  Two months later, the District Court removed the remaining Scruggs-affiliated attorneys from the case, based on their alleged involvement in improper payments made from Scruggs to respondents.  The District Court did not punish respondents themselves for the payments because they were not made \xe2\x80\x9caware of the ethical implications\xe2\x80\x9d and, as laypersons, \xe2\x80\x9care not bound by the rules of professional conduct that apply to\xe2\x80\x9d attorneys.  App. 21.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In deciding petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion the District Court considered only the seal violations that occurred before the seal was lifted in part, reasoning the partial lifting in effect had mooted the seal.  Applying the test for dismissal set out in <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Lujan </i>v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co.</i>, 67 F.\xc2\xa03d 242, 245\xe2\x80\x93247 (CA9 1995), the District Court balanced three factors: (1) the actual harm to the Government, (2) the severity of the violations, and (3) the evidence of bad faith.  The court decided against dismissal.  Petitioner did not request some lesser sanction.  The case went to trial, resulting in a victory for respondents on what the Court of Appeals referred to as a \xe2\x80\x9cbellwether\xe2\x80\x9d claim regarding a single damaged home.  794 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 462.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the denial of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss.  The court recognized that the case presented two related issues of the first impression under its case law: (1) whether a seal violation requires mandatory dismissal of a relator\xe2\x80\x99s complaint and, if not, (2) what standard governs a district court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to dismiss.  The court noted that the Courts of Appeals for the Second and Ninth Circuits had held that the FCA does not require automatic dismissal for a seal violation, while the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had held that dismissal is mandatory.  See <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Pilon</i> v. <i>Martin Marietta Corp.</i>, 60 F.\xc2\xa03d 995, 998 (CA2 1995); <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel.

It then considered the same factors the District Court had weighed and came to a similar conclusion.  <i>Id.,</i> at 471\xe2\x80\x93472.  First, the Court of Appeals held the Government was in all likelihood not harmed by the disclosures because none of them led to the publication of the pendency of the suit before the seal was lifted in part.  Second, the Court of Appeals determined the violations were not severe in their repercussions because respondents had complied with the seal requirement when they first filed their suit.  Third, the Court of Appeals assumed, without deciding, that the bad behavior of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 then-attorney could be imputed to respondents; but it held that, even presuming the attribution of bad faith, the other factors favored respondents.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court granted certiorari, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016), and now affirms.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s primary contention is that a violation of the seal provision necessarily requires a relator\xe2\x80\x99s complaint to be dismissed.

It is proper to infer that, had Congress intended to require dismissal for a violation of the seal requirement, it would have said so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is consistent with the general purpose of \xc2\xa73730(b)(2).  The seal provision was enacted in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s as part of a set of reforms that were meant to \xe2\x80\x9cencourage more private enforcement suits.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 99\xe2\x80\x93345, pp.\xc2\xa023\xe2\x80\x9324 (1986).  At the time, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the most serious problem plaguing effective enforcement\xe2\x80\x9d of the FCA was \xe2\x80\x9ca lack of resources on the part of Federal enforcement agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 7.  The Senate Committee Report indicates that the seal provision was meant to allay the Government\xe2\x80\x99s concern that a relator filing a civil complaint would alert defendants to a pending federal criminal investigation.  <i>Id.</i>, at 24.  Because the seal requirement was intended in main to protect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests, it would make little sense to adopt a rigid interpretation of the seal provision that prejudices the Government by depriving it of needed assistance from private parties.  The Federal Government agrees with this interpretation.  It informs the Court that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s test \xe2\x80\x9cwould undermine the very governmental interests that the seal provision is meant to protect.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 10.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments to the contrary are unavailing.  First, petitioner urges that because the seal provision appears in the subsection of the FCA creating the relator\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action, Congress intended to condition the right to bring suit on compliance with the seal requirement.  It is true that, as discussed further below, the Court sometimes has concluded that Congress conditioned the authority to file a private right of action on compliance with a statutory mandate.  <i>E.g., Hallstrom</i> v. <i>Tillamook County</i>,\n\n493 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20\n\xe2\x80\x9326 (1989).  There is no textual indication, however, that Congress did so here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 3730(b)(2) does not tie the seal requirement to the right to bring the <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam</i> suit in conditional terms.  As noted above, the statute just provides: \xe2\x80\x9cThe complaint shall be filed in camera, shall remain under seal for at least 60 days, and shall not be served on the defendant until the court so orders.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The text at issue in <i>Hallstrom</i>, by contrast,<i> </i>was quite different than the statutory language that controls here.  The <i>Hallstrom </i>statute, part of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, provided: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98No action may be commenced .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prior to sixty days after the plaintiff has given notice of the violation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to the Government.  493 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 25.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioner cites two additional cases to support its argument, but those decisions concerned statutes that used even clearer conditional words, like \xe2\x80\x9cif\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunless.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>United States ex rel. Texas Portland Cement Co.</i> v. <i>McCord</i>,\n\n233 U.\xc2\xa0S. 157,\n161 (1914)\n (statute allowed creditors of Government contractors to bring suit \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98if no suit should be brought by the United States within six months from the completion and final settlement of said contract\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>McNeil</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n508 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106\n, n.\xc2\xa01 (1993) (statute provided that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[a]n action shall not be instituted upon a claim against the United States for money damages .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. unless the claimant shall have first presented the claim to the appropriate Federal agency\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Again, the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s structure shows that Congress knew how to draft the kind of statutory language that petitioner seeks to read into \xc2\xa73730(b)(2)<i>.  </i>The applicable version of the public disclosure bar, for example, requires a district court to dismiss an action when the underlying information has already been made available to the public, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unless\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiff is the Attorney General or an original source.  <i>Graham County Soil and Water Conservation Dist. </i>v.<i> United States ex rel. Wilson, </i>559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 286.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, petitioner contends that because this Court has described the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s <i>qui\xc2\xa0tam </i>provisions as \xe2\x80\x9ceffecting a partial assignment of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s damages claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens</i>, 529 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 773, adherence to all of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s mandatory requirements\xe2\x80\x94no matter how small\xe2\x80\x94is a condition of the assignment.  This argument fails for the same reason as the one discussed above: Petitioner can show no textual indication in the statute suggesting that the relator\xe2\x80\x99s ability to bring suit depends on adherence to the seal requirement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, petitioner points to a few stray sentences in the Senate Committee Report that it claims support the mandatory dismissal rule.  As explained above, however, the Report\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the general purpose of the statute is best understood to support respondents.  <i>Supra,</i> at 7.  And, furthermore, because the meaning of the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s text and structure is \xe2\x80\x9cplain and unambiguous, we need not accept petitioner[\xe2\x80\x99s] invitation to consider the legislative history.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Whitfield </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 209,\n215 (2005)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s secondary argument is that the District Court did not consider the proper factors when declining to dismiss respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint or, at a minimum, that it was plain error not to consider respondents\xe2\x80\x99 conduct after the seal was lifted in part.  This Court holds the District Court did not abuse its discretion by denying petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s motion, much less commit plain error.  In light of the questionable conduct of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 prior attorney, it well may not have been reversible error had the District Court granted the motion; that possibility, however, need not be considered here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In general, the question whether dismissal is appropriate should be left to the sound discretion of the district court.  While the factors articulated in <i>United States ex\xc2\xa0rel. Lujan </i>v. <i>Hughes Aircraft Co. </i>appear to be appropriate, it is unnecessary to explore these and other relevant considerations.<i> </i>These standards can be discussed in the course of later cases.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner and its <i>amici</i> place great emphasis on the reputational harm FCA defendants may suffer when the seal requirement is violated.  But even if every seal violation does not mandate dismissal, that sanction remains a possible form of relief.  District courts have inherent power, moreover, to impose sanctions short of dismissal for violations of court orders.  See <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>NASCO, Inc.</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32\n\xe2\x80\x9346 (1991).  Remedial tools like monetary penalties or attorney discipline remain available to punish and deter seal violations even when dismissal is not appropriate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of note in this case, petitioner did not request any sanction other than dismissal.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 3\xe2\x80\x934, 17.  Had petitioner sought some lesser sanctions, the District Court might have taken a different course.  Yet petitioner failed to do so.  On this record, the question whether a lesser sanction is warranted is not preserved.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is </p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">Affirmed.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
