The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision ignored well-established principles.  It did not consider reasonable grounds that could have supported the state court\xe2\x80\x99s summary decision, and it analyzed respondent\xe2\x80\x99s arguments without any meaningful deference to the state court.  Accordingly, the petition for certiorari is granted, and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondent Nicholas Beaudreaux shot and killed Wayne Drummond during a late-night argument in 2006.  Dayo Esho and Brandon Crowder were both witnesses to the shooting.  The next day, Crowder told the police that he knew the shooter from middle school, but did not know the shooter\xe2\x80\x99s name.  Esho described the shooter, but also did not know his name.  Seventeen months later, Crowder was arrested for an unrelated crime.  While Crowder was in custody, police showed him a middle-school yearbook with Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s picture, as well as a photo lineup including Beaudreaux.  Crowder identified Beaudreaux as the shooter in the Drummond murder.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Officers interviewed Esho the next day.  They first spoke with him during his lunch break.  They showed him a display that included a recent picture of Beaudreaux and pictures of five other men.  Esho tentatively identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, saying his picture \xe2\x80\x9cwas \xe2\x80\x98closest\xe2\x80\x99 to the gunman.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 4a.  Later that day, one of the officers found another photograph of Beaudreaux that was taken \xe2\x80\x9ccloser to the date\xe2\x80\x9d of the shooting.  Record ER 263.  Beaudreaux looked different in the two photographs.  In the first, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98his face [was] a little wider and his head [was] a little higher.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ER 262.  Between four and six hours after the first interview, the officers returned to show Esho a second six-man photo lineup, which contained the older picture of Beaudreaux.  Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s photo was in a different position in the lineup than it had been in the first one.  Esho again identified Beaudreaux as the shooter, telling the officers that the second picture was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98very close.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ER 263\xe2\x80\x93ER 264.  But he again declined to positively state that Beaudreaux was the shooter.  Esho was hesitant because there were \xe2\x80\x9ca few things\xe2\x80\x9d he remembered about the shooter that would require seeing him in person.  <i>Id.,</i> at ER 283\xe2\x80\x93ER 284.  At a preliminary hearing, Esho identified Beaudreaux as the shooter.  At trial, Esho explained that it \xe2\x80\x9cclicked\xe2\x80\x9d when he saw Beaudreaux in person based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe way that he walked.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at ER 285.  After seeing him in person, Esho was \xe2\x80\x9csure\xe2\x80\x9d that Beaudreaux was the shooter.  <i>Ibid.</i>  At no time did any investigator or prosecutor suggest to Esho that Beaudreaux was the one who shot Drummond.  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beaudreaux was tried in 2009 for first-degree murder and attempted second-degree robbery.  Esho and Crowder both testified against Beaudreaux and both identified him as Drummond\xe2\x80\x99s shooter.  The jury found Beaudreaux guilty, and the trial court sentenced him to a term of 50 years to life.  Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s conviction was affirmed on direct appeal, and his first state habeas petition was denied.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2013, Beaudreaux filed a second state habeas petition.  He claimed, among other things, that his trial attorney was ineffective for failing to file a motion to suppress Esho\xe2\x80\x99s identification testimony.  The California Court of Appeal summarily denied the petition, and the California Supreme Court denied review.  Petitioner then filed a federal habeas petition, which the District Court denied.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A divided panel of the Ninth Circuit reversed.  The panel majority spent most of its opinion conducting a <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> analysis of the merits of the would-be suppression motion\xe2\x80\x94relying in part on arguments and theories that Beaudreaux had not presented to the state court in his second state habeas petition.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 1a\xe2\x80\x937a; Record ER 153\xe2\x80\x93ER 154.  It first determined that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file the suppression motion constituted deficient performance.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 3a.  The circumstances surrounding Esho\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial identification were \xe2\x80\x9cunduly suggestive,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the Ninth Circuit, because only Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s picture was in both photo lineups.  <i>Id.,</i> at 4a.  And, relying on Ninth Circuit precedent, the panel majority found that the preliminary hearing was unduly suggestive as well.  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Johnson </i>v. <i>Sublett</i>, 63 F.\xc2\xa03d 926, 929 (CA9 1995)).  The panel majority next concluded that, under the totality of the circumstances, Esho\xe2\x80\x99s identification was not reliable enough to overcome the suggestiveness of the procedures.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 5a.  The panel majority then determined that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to file the suppression motion prejudiced Beaudreaux, given the weakness of the State\xe2\x80\x99s case.  <i>Id.,</i> at 5a\xe2\x80\x936a.  After conducting this <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i> analysis of Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness claim, the panel majority asserted that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of this claim was not just wrong, but objectively unreasonable under \xc2\xa72254(d).  See <i>id.,</i> at 6a\xe2\x80\x937a.  Judge Gould dissented.  He argued that the state court could have reasonably concluded that Beaudreaux had failed to prove prejudice.  <i>Id.,</i> at 8a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The State of California petitioned for certiorari.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), a federal court cannot grant habeas relief \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. resulted in a decision that was con- trary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\xe2\x80\x9d this Court, or \xe2\x80\x9ca decision that was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72254(d).  When, as here, there is no reasoned state-court decision on the merits, the federal court \xe2\x80\x9cmust determine what arguments or theories .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. could have supported the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision; and then it must ask whether it is possible fairminded jurists could disagree that those arguments or theories are inconsistent with the holding in a prior decision of this Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Harrington </i>v. <i>Richter</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86, 102 (2011).  If such dis- agreement is possible, then the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s claim must be denied.  <i>Ibid.</i>  We have often emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9cthis standard is difficult to meet\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cbecause it was meant to be.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>; <i>e.g., Burt </i>v. <i>Titlow</i>,\n\n571 U.\xc2\xa0S. 12, 20 (2013).<i> </i>The Ninth Circuit failed to properly apply this standard.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">To prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a petitioner must demonstrate both deficient performance and prejudice.  <i>Strickland </i>v. <i>Washington</i>,\n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668, 687 (1984).  The state court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of relief in this case was not an unreasonable application of <i>Strickland</i>.  A fairminded jurist could conclude that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance was not deficient because counsel reasonably could have determined that the motion to suppress would have failed.  See <i>Premo </i>v. <i>Moore</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 115, 124 (2011).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This Court has previously described \xe2\x80\x9cthe approach appropriately used to determine whether the Due Process Clause requires suppression of an eyewitness identification tainted by police arrangement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perry</i> v. <i>New Hampshire</i>,\n\n565 U.\xc2\xa0S. 228, 238 (2012).  In particular, the Court has said that \xe2\x80\x9cdue process concerns arise only when law enforcement officers use[d] an identification procedure that is <i>both</i> suggestive and unnecessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 238\xe2\x80\x93239 (citing <i>Manson </i>v. <i>Braithwaite</i>,\n\n432 U.\xc2\xa0S. 98, 107, 109 (1977), and <i>Neil </i>v. <i>Biggers</i>,\n\n409 U.\xc2\xa0S. 188, 198 (1972); emphasis added).<i> </i>To be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impermissibly suggestive,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the procedure must \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 197 (quoting <i>Simmons </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377, 384 (1968)).  It is not enough that the procedure \xe2\x80\x9cmay have in some respects fallen short of the ideal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 385\xe2\x80\x93386.  Even when an unnecessarily suggestive procedure was used, \xe2\x80\x9csuppression of the resulting identification is not the inevitable consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perry</i>, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 239.  Instead, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Due Process Clause requires courts to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether improper police conduct created a \xe2\x80\x98substantial likelihood of misidentification.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Biggers</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 201).  \xe2\x80\x9c[R]eliability [of the eyewitness identification] is the linchpin\xe2\x80\x99 of that evaluation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Perry</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 239 (quoting <i>Manson</i>, 432 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 114; alterations in original).  The factors affecting reliability include \xe2\x80\x9cthe opportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime, the witness\xe2\x80\x99 degree of attention, the accuracy of his prior description of the criminal, the level of certainty demonstrated at the confrontation, and the time between the crime and the confrontation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 114.  This Court has held that pretrial identification procedures violated the Due Process Clause only once, in <i>Foster </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440 (1969).  There, the police used two highly suggestive lineups and \xe2\x80\x9ca one-to-one confrontation,\xe2\x80\x9d which \xe2\x80\x9cmade it all but inevitable that [the witness] would identify [the defendant].\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 443.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, there is at least one theory that could have led a fairminded jurist to conclude that the suppression motion would have failed.  See <i>Richter</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 102.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  The state court could have reasonably concluded that Beaudreaux failed to prove that, \xe2\x80\x9cunder the \xe2\x80\x98totality of the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the identification was not \xe2\x80\x9creliable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Biggers</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 199.  Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s claim was facially deficient because his state habeas petition failed to even address this requirement.  See Record ER 153\xe2\x80\x93ER 154.  And the state court could have reasonably concluded that the totality of the circumstances tipped against Beaudreaux.  True, Esho gave a vague initial description of the shooter, see <i>Manson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 115 (noting the detailed physical description the witness gave \xe2\x80\x9cminutes after\xe2\x80\x9d), and there was a 17-month delay between the shooting and the identification, see <i>Biggers</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 201 (determining that \xe2\x80\x9ca lapse of seven months .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would be a seriously negative factor in most cases\xe2\x80\x9d).  But, as the District Court found, Esho had a good opportunity to view the shooter, having talked to Beaudreaux immediately after the shooting.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.  He also was paying attention during the crime and even remembered Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s distinctive walk.  See <i>id.,</i> at 64a, 66a<i>.</i>  Esho demonstrated a high overall level of certainty in his identification.  He chose Beaudreaux\xe2\x80\x99s picture in both photo lineups, and he was \xe2\x80\x9csure\xe2\x80\x9d about his identification once he saw Beaudreaux in person.  Record ER 285; App. to Pet. for Cert. 63a\xe2\x80\x9364a, 66a.<i> </i> There also was \xe2\x80\x9clittle pressure\xe2\x80\x9d on Esho to make a particular identification.  <i>Manson</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 116. <i> </i>It would not have been \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cobjectively unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to weigh the totality of these circumstances against Beaudreaux.  <i>White </i>v. <i>Woodall</i>,\n\n572 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415, 419 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion was not just wrong.

The Ninth Circuit essentially evaluated the merits <i>de\xc2\xa0novo</i>, only tacking on a perfunctory statement at the end of its analysis asserting that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s decision was unreasonable.  But deference to the state court should have been near its apex in this case, which involves a <i>Strickland </i>claim based on a motion that turns on general, fact-driven standards such as suggestiveness and reliability.  The Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s analysis did not follow this Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated holding that, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he more general the rule .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the more leeway [state] courts have.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Renico </i>v. <i>Lett</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 766, 776 (2010) (brackets in original).
