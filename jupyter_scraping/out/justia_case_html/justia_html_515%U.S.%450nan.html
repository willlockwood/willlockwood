The exception that the Tribe would carve out of the State\'s taxing authority gains no support from the rule that Indians and tribes are generally immune from state taxation, as this principle does not operate outside Indian country. In addition, the Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, which guarantees the Tribe and its members that "no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for the [Tribe\'s] government," provides only for the Tribe\'s sovereignty within Indian country and does not confer super-sovereign authority to interfere with another jurisdiction\'s sovereign right to tax income, from all sources, of those who choose to live within that jurisdiction\'s limits. Nor can the Treaty be read to incorporate the repudiated doctrine that an income tax imposed on government employees should be treated as a tax on the government. The Treaty\'s signatories likely gave no thought to a State\'s authority to tax income of tribal members living in the State\'s domain, since the Treaty\'s purpose was to move the Tribe to unsettled land not then within a State.

In so holding, we adhere to settled law: when Congress does not instruct otherwise, a State\'s excise tax is unenforceable if its legal incidence falls on a Tribe or its members for sales made within Indian country. We further hold, however, that Oklahoma may tax the income (including wages from tribal employment) of all persons, Indian and non-Indian alike, residing in the State outside Indian country. The Treaty between the United States and the Tribe, which guarantees the Tribe and its members that "no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for the government of" the Chickasaw Nation, does not displace the rule, accepted interstate and internationally, that a sovereign may tax the entire income of its residents.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>The Chickasaw Nation, a federally recognized Indian Tribe, commenced this civil action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Oklahoma, to stop the State of Oklahoma from enforcing several state taxes against the Tribe and its members.3 Pertinent here, the District</p><p>Comm\'n v. Citizen Band of Potawatomi Tribe of Okla., <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/505/case.html">498 U. S. 505</a> (1991).</p><p>2 "Indian country," as Congress comprehends that term, see 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1151, includes "formal and informal reservations, dependent Indian communities, and Indian allotments, whether restricted or held in trust by the United States." <i>Sac and Fox, </i>508 U. S., at 123.</p><p>3 In addition to the motor fuels and income taxes before us, the Tribe\'s complaint challenged motor vehicle excise taxes on Tribe-owned vehicles, retail sales taxes on certain purchases by the Tribe for its own use, and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="454">454</a></p><p>Court, ruling on cross-motions for summary judgment, held for the State on the motor fuels tax imposition and largely for the Tribe on the income tax issue. The Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled for the Tribe and its members on both issues: It held that the State may not apply the motor fuels tax to fuel sold by the Tribe\'s retail stores, and, further, that the State may not tax the wages of members of the Chickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, even if they reside outside Indian country. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/31/964/">31 F.3d 964</a> (1994).</p><p>Concerning the motor fuels tax, the Tenth Circuit disapproved the District Court\'s "balancing of the respective tribal and state interests" approach. <i>Id., </i>at 972. The legal incidence of the tax, the Court of Appeals ruled, is the key concept. That incidence, the Tenth Circuit determined, falls directly on fuel retailers-here, on the Tribe, due to its operation of two convenience stores that sell fuel to tribal members and other persons. Oklahoma\'s imposition of its fuels tax on the Tribe as retailer, the Court of Appeals concluded, "conflicts with ... the traditional scope of Indian sovereign authority." <i>Ibid. </i>Because the State asserted no congressional authorization for its exaction, the Tenth Circuit declared the fuels tax preempted.</p><p>Oklahoma\'s income tax, in the Court of Appeals\' view, could not be applied to any tribal member employed by the Tribe; 4 residence, the Tenth Circuit said, was "simply not relevant to [its] determination." <i>Id., </i>at 979. The Court of Appeals relied on the provision of the Treaty of Dancing</p><p>sales taxes on 3.2% beer sold at the Tribe\'s two convenience stores, as well as tax warrants issued against officers of the Tribe. In the course of litigation, Oklahoma apparently decided not to contest the Tribe\'s claims regarding the vehicle and retail sales taxes, and withdrew the warrants; the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed the District Court\'s grant of summary judgment for the State on the 3.2% beer tax, and the Tribe has not sought our review of that issue.</p><p>4 In a ruling not before us, see Brief for Respondent 47, the Court of Appeals upheld application of Oklahoma\'s income tax to Chickasaw Nation employees who are not members of the Tribe.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="455">455</a></p><p>Rabbit Creek, Sept. 27, 1830, Art. IV, 7 Stat. 333-334, that "no Territory or State shall ever have a right to pass laws for the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People and their descendants." To this treaty language, the Tenth Circuit applied "the general rule that \'[d]oubtful expressions are to be resolved in favor of\' the Indians." 31 F. 3d, at 978 (quoting <i>McClanahan </i>v. <i>Arizona Tax Comm\'n, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/164/case.html">411 U. S. 164</a>, 174 (1973)). The Court of Appeals also noted that it had endeavored to "rea[d] the treaty as the Indians [who signed it] would have understood it." 31 F. 3d, at 979.</p><p>We granted the State\'s petition for certiorari, 513 U. S. 1071 (1995), and now (1) affirm the Court of Appeals\' judgment as to the motor fuels tax, and (2) reverse that judgment as to the income tax applied to earnings of tribal members who work for the Tribe but reside in the State outside Indian country.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>The Tribe contends, and the Tenth Circuit held, that Oklahoma\'s fuels tax 5 is levied on retailers, not on distributors or consumers. The respect due to the Chickasaw Nation\'s sovereignty, the Tribe maintains, means Oklahoma-absent congressional permission-may not collect its tax for fuel supplied to, and sold by, the Tribe at its convenience stores. In support of the tax immunity it asserts, the Tribe recalls our reaffirmations to this effect: "The Constitution vests the Federal Government with exclusive authority over relations with Indian tribes ... , and in recognition of the sovereignty retained by Indian tribes even after formation of the United States, Indian tribes and individuals generally are exempt from state taxation within their own territory." <i>Montana </i>v. <i>Blackfeet Tribe, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/759/case.html">471 U. S. 759</a>, 764 (1985); see</p><p>5 According to the State\'s Tax Commission, Oklahoma imposes fuels tax at the rate of 17 cents per gallon for gasoline and 14 cents per gallon for diesel fuel.

Brief for Petitioner 19 (quoting <i>Blackfeet Tribe, </i>471 U. S., at 764). At least as to some aspects of state taxation, Oklahoma asserts, an approach "balancing the state and tribal interests" is in order. Brief for Petitioner 17. Even if the legal incidence of the fuels tax falls on the Tribe (as retailer), Oklahoma concludes, tax immunity should be disallowed here because "the state interest supporting the levy is <i>compelling, ... </i>the tribal interest is <i>insubstantial, </i>and ... the state tax would have no effect on \'tribal governance and self-determination.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 22 (emphasis in original).</p><p>In the alternative, Oklahoma argues that the Court of Appeals "erred in holding that the legal incidence of the fuel tax falls on the retailer." <i>Id., </i>at 10. Moreover, the State newly contends, even if the fuels tax otherwise would be impermissible, Congress, in the 1936 Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 104, expressly permitted state taxation of reservation activity of this type. Brief for Petitioner 23-24.</p><p>We set out first our reason for refusing to entertain at this late date Oklahoma\'s argument that the Hayden-Cartwright Act expressly permits state levies on motor fuels sold on Indian reservations. We then explain why we agree with the Tenth Circuit on the Tribe\'s exemption from Oklahoma\'s fuels tax.</p><p align="center">\nA</p><p>On brief, the State points out-for the first time in this litigation-that the Hayden-Cartwright Act, 4 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 104, expressly authorizes States to tax motor fuel sales on "United States military or other reservations." \xc2\xa7 104(a). The Act\'s word "reservations," Oklahoma maintains, encompasses Indian reservations. Brief for Petitioner 23-24. We decline to address this question of statutory interpretation.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="457">457</a></p><p>The State made no reference to the Hayden-Cartwright Act in the courts of first and second instance. And even though the Court of Appeals flagged the Act\'s possible relevance,6 Oklahoma did not mention this 1936 legislation in its petition for certiorari. Nor is Oklahoma\'s newly discovered claim of vintage legislative authorization "fairly included" 7 in the question the State tendered for our review: "Whether principles of federal pre-emption or Indian sovereignty preclude a State from imposing a tax on motor fuel sold by an Indian tribe .... ?" Pet. for Cert. (i).

This case does not fit that bill.</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>Assuming, then, that Congress has not expressly authorized the imposition of Oklahoma\'s fuels tax on fuel sold by the Tribe, we must decide if the State\'s exaction is nonetheless permitted. Oklahoma asks us to make the determination by weighing the relevant state and tribal interests, and urges that the balance tilts in its favor. Oklahoma emphasizes that the fuel sold is used "almost exclusively on state roads," imposing "very substantial costs on the State-but no burden at all on the Tribe." Brief for Petitioner 9.

S. 202</a>, 216-217 (1987) (balancing interests affected by State\'s attempt to regulate onreservation high-stakes bingo operation), and state attempts to compel Indians to collect and remit taxes actually imposed on non-Indians, see, <i>e. </i>g., <i>Moe </i>v. <i>Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of Flathead Reservation, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/463/case.html">425 U.

The factors that would enter into an inquiry of the kind the State urges are daunting. If we were to make "economic reality" our guide, we might be obliged to consider, for example, how completely retailers can pass along tax increases without sacrificing sales volume-a complicated matter dependent on the characteristics of the market for the relevant product. Cf. <i>Yakima, 502 </i>U.

Brief for South Dakota et al. as <i>Amici Curiae </i>2.9 And if a State is unable to enforce a tax because the legal incidence of the impost is on Indians or Indian tribes, the State generally is free to amend its law to shift the tax\'s legal incidence.

Cf. <i>Moe, </i>425 U.

Stat., Tit. 68, \xc2\xa7 505(C) (1991) (emphasis added). The inference that the tax obligation is legally the retailer\'s, not the distributor\'s, is supported by the prescriptions that sales between distributors are exempt from taxation, \xc2\xa7 507, but sales from a distributor to a retailer are subject to taxation, \xc2\xa7 505(E). Further, if the distributor remits taxes it subsequently is unable to collect from the retailer, the distributor may deduct the uncollected amount from its future payments to the Tax Commission. \xc2\xa7 505(C). The distributor, then, "is no more than a transmittal agent</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="462">462</a></p><p>for the taxes imposed on the retailer." 31 F. 3d, at 971.

No provision sets off the retailer\'s liability when consumers fail to make payments due; neither are retailers compensated for their tax collection efforts. And the tax imposed when a distributor sells fuel to a retailer applies whether or not the fuel is ever purchased by a consumer. See, <i>e. </i>g., \xc2\xa7 502 ("There is hereby levied an excise tax ... upon the sale of each and every gallon of gasoline sold, or stored and distributed, or withdrawn from storage .... "). Finally, Oklahoma\'s law imposes no liability of any kind on a consumer for purchasing, possessing, or using untaxed fuel; in contrast, the legislation makes it unlawful for distributors or retailers "to sell or offer for sale in this state, motor fuel or diesel fuel while delinquent in the payment of any excise tax due the state." \xc2\xa7 505(C).</p><p>As the Court of Appeals fairly and reasonably concluded: "[T]he import of the language and the structure of the fuel tax statutes is that the distributor collects the tax from the retail purchaser of the fuel"; the "motor fuel taxes are legally imposed on the retailer rather than on the distributor or the consumer." 31 F. 3d, at 971-972.</p><p align="center">\nIII</p><p>Regarding Oklahoma\'s income tax, the Court of Appeals declared that the State may not tax the wages of members of the Chickasaw Nation who work for the Tribe, including members who reside in Oklahoma outside Indian country.</p><p>The holding on tribal members who live in the State outside Indian country runs up against a well-established principle of interstate and international taxation-namely, that a jurisdiction, such as Oklahoma, may tax all the income</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="463">463</a></p><p>of its residents, even income earned outside the taxing jurisdiction: 11</p><blockquote><p>\n"That the receipt of income by a resident of the territory of a taxing sovereignty is a taxable event is universally recognized.

By its terms, the Treaty applies only to persons and property "within [the Nation\'s] limits." We comprehend this Treaty language to provide for the Tribe\'s sovereignty within Indian country. We do not read the Treaty as conferring super-sovereign authority to interfere with another jurisdiction\'s sovereign right to tax income, from all sources, of those who choose to live within that jurisdiction\'s limits.</p><p>The Tribe and the United States 16 further urge us to read the Treaty in accord with the repudiated view that an income tax imposed on government employees should be treated as a tax on the government.

That dubious doctrine, by typing taxation of wages earned by tribal employees as taxation of the Tribe itself, would require an exemption for all employees of the Tribe-not just tribal members, but nonmembers as well. The Court of Appeals rejected such an extension, see 31 F. 3d, at 975 ("It is settled that the income tax is imposed on the employee, not the employer .... Therefore, to the extent that the income tax is imposed on non-member employees who have no established claim to tribal ancestry, the tax does not infringe upon the treaty prohibition."), and even the Tribe is not urging this view before us, admitting that it is "substantially more tenuous."

The issue is whether such a tax falls within the scope of a promise this Nation made to the Chickasaw Nation in 1837-a promise that no "State shall ever have a right to pass laws for the government of the [Chickasaw] Nation of Red People and their descendants ... but the U. S. shall forever secure said [Chickasaw] Nation from, and against, all laws" except those the Tribe made itself (and certain others not relevant here). Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, 7 Stat. 333 (1830) (see the Appendix to the opinion of the Court); Treaty of Jan. 17, 1837, 11 Stat. 573. In my view, this language covers the tax.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="469">469</a></p><p>For one thing, history suggests that the signatories to the Treaty intended the language to provide a broad guarantee that state law would not apply to the Chickasaws <i>if </i>they moved west of the Mississippi River-which they did. The promise\'s broad reach was meant initially to induce the Choctaws to make such a move in 1830, and it was extended, in 1837, to the Chickasaws for the same reason, all with the hope that other tribes would follow. See A. DeRosier, Removal of the Choctaw Indians 46, 100-128 (1970); id., at 104 (quoting, among other things, President Jackson\'s statement to Congress, in 1829, that "if the Indians remained east of the Mississippi River, they would be subject to the laws of the several states," but, if they accepted the Treaty and moved west, they would be "free of white men except for a few soldiers").</p><p>For another thing, the language of this promise, read broadly and in light of its purpose, fits the tax at issue. The United States promised to secure the "[Chickasaw] Nation from, and against, all laws" for the government of the N ation, except those the Nation made itself or that Congress made. Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, supra (emphasis added). The law in question does not fall within one of the explicit exceptions to this promise. Nor need the Court read the Treaty as creating an additional implied exception where, as here, the law in question likely affects significantly and directly the way in which the Tribe conducts its affairs in areas subject to tribal jurisdiction-how much, for example, it will likely have to pay workers on its land and what kinds of tribal expenditures it consequently will be able to afford. The impact of the tax upon tribal wages, tribal members, and tribal land makes it possible, indeed reasonable, to consider Oklahoma\'s tax (insofar as it applies to these tribal wages) as amounting to a law "for the government of" the Tribe. Indeed, in 1837, when the United States made its promise to the Chickasaws, the law considered a tax like the present one to be a tax on its source-i. <i>e., </i>the Tribe</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="470">470</a></p><p>itself. See, <i>e. g., Dobbins </i>v. <i>Commissioners of Erie Cty., 16 </i>Pet. 435, 445-448 (1842) (Federal Government employee salaries exempt from state tax laws). Although tax law subsequently changed, see <i>Graves </i>v. <i>New York ex rel. O\'Keefe, 306 </i>U. S. 466, 480 (1939), the empirical connection between tax and Tribe has not. The Treaty\'s basic objective, namely, practical protection for the Tribe, suggests that this unchanging empirical impact, rather than shifting legal tax theory, is the critical consideration.</p><p>The majority sets forth several strong arguments against the Treaty\'s application. But, ultimately, I do not find them convincing. It is true, as the majority points out, that wellestablished principles of tax law permit States to tax those who reside within their boundaries. It is equally true that the Chickasaws whom Oklahoma seeks to tax live in the State at large, although they work in Indian country. But, these truths simply pose the question in this case: Does the Treaty provide an <i>exception </i>to well-established principles of tax law, roughly the same way as do, say, treaties governing diplomats and employees of international organizations? See, <i>e. g., Toll </i>v. <i>Moreno, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/1/case.html">458 U. S. 1</a>, 14-15 (1982) (explaining that some such individuals are exempt from federal, state, and local income taxation). The statement of basic tax principles, by themselves, cannot provide the answer.</p><p>The majority is also concerned about a "line-drawing" problem. If the Treaty invalidates the law before us, what about an Oklahoma tax, for example, on residents who work for, but are not members of, the Tribe? I acknowledge the problem of line drawing, but that problem exists irrespective of where the line is drawn here. And, because this tax (1) has a strong connection to tribal government (i. <i>e., </i>it falls on tribal members, who work for the Tribe, in Indian country), (2) does not regulate conduct outside Indian country, and (3) does not (as the Solicitor General points out) represent an effort to recover a proportionate share of, say, the cost of providing state services to residents, I am convinced that it</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="471">471</a></p><p>falls on the side of the line that the Treaty\'s language and purpose seek to prohibit. To decide that the Treaty prohibits the law here is not to decide whether or not it would prohibit a law with a weaker link to tribal government or a stronger impact outside Indian country.</p><p>One final legal consideration strengthens the conclusion I reach. The law requires courts to construe ambiguous treaties in favor of the Indians. <i>County of Oneida </i>v. <i>Oneida Indian Nation of </i>N. <i>Y., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/226/case.html">470 U. S. 226</a>, 247 (1985). The majority believes that even a "liberal construction cannot save the Tribe\'s claim," <i>ante, </i>at 466, because the Treaty says that the United States is "obliged to secure to the said [Chickasaw] Nation ... the jurisdiction and government of all the persons and property that may be <i>within their limits </i>west." Treaty of Dancing Rabbit Creek, 7 Stat. 333-334 (emphasis added). This language, when viewed in its historical context, however, seems primarily designed to point out that the Treaty operates only in respect to Chickasaw lands west of the Mississippi-i. <i>e., </i>that the Chickasaws would receive no protection unless they moved there. Regardless, the Oklahoma tax in question does affect "persons," namely, tribal members, and "property," namely, their wages, which members work and which wages are paid well "within" the Nation\'s "limits," i. <i>e., </i>in Indian country. Admittedly, the quoted language, by itself, does not say for certain that such effects are sufficient to bring the state law within the Treaty\'s prohibition, but neither does it clearly make residency (rather than, say, place of employment) an absolute prerequisite. In these circumstances, the law requires us to give the Tribe the benefit of the doubt.</p><p>Thus, in my view, whether we construe the Treaty\'s language liberally or literally, Oklahoma\'s tax falls within its scope. For these reasons, I believe the Treaty bars the tax. And, although I join the remainder of the Court\'s opinion, I respectfully dissent on this point.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
