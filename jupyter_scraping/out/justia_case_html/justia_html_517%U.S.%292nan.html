Argued November 27, 1995-Decided March 27, 1996</p><p>A jury found petitioner guilty of one count of participating in a conspiracy to distribute controlled substances in violation of 21 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 846 and one count of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) "in concert" with others in violation of \xc2\xa7 848. The "in concert" element of his CCE offense was based on the same agreement as the \xc2\xa7 846 conspiracy. The District Court entered judgment of conviction on both counts and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without possible release on each, the sentences to be served concurrently. Pursuant to 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3013, it also ordered petitioner to pay a special assessment of $50 on each count. The Seventh Circuit affirmed, relying on <i>Jeffers </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html">432 U. S. 137</a>, to reject petitioner\'s contention that his convictions and concurrent life sentences impermissibly punished him twice for the same offense.</p><p><i>Held: </i>The District Court erred in sentencing petitioner to concurrent life sentences on the \xc2\xa7 846 and \xc2\xa7 848 counts.

The test for determining whether there are two offenses is whether each of the statutory provisions requires proof of a fact which the other does not. <i>Blockburger </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/299/case.html">284 U.

S., at 149-150 (plurality opinion); <i>id., </i>at 158, 159, n. 5 (dissenting opinion), and particularly because the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7 848\'s "in concert" phrase signifies mutual agreement in a common plan or enterprise, the Court now resolves definitively that a guilty verdict on a \xc2\xa7 848 charge necessarily includes a finding that the defendant also participated in a conspiracy violative of \xc2\xa7 846. Conspiracy is therefore a lesser included offense of CCE. Pp. 297-300.</p><p>(b) The Court rejects the Government\'s contention that the presumption against multiple punishments does not invalidate either of petitioner\'s convictions because the sentence on the second one was concurrent.

Support for that view cannot be inferred from the fact that this Court\'s <i>Jeffers </i>judgment allowed convictions under both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 846 and 848 to stand, since those convictions were entered in separate trials, the Court\'s review addressed only the \xc2\xa7 848 conviction, and that conviction was affirmed because the four-Justice plurality decided that Jeffers had waived any right to object, see 432 U.

S. C. \xc2\xa7 846, and of conducting a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) in violation of \xc2\xa7 848. The "in concert" element of his CCE offense was based on the same agreement as the \xc2\xa7 846 conspiracy. The question presented is whether it was therefore improper for the District Court to sentence him to concurrent life sentences on the two counts.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>Petitioner organized and supervised a criminal enterprise that distributed cocaine in Warren County, Illinois, from 1988 until December 1990, when he was arrested by federal agents. He was charged with several offenses, of which only Count One, the CCE charge, and Count Two, the conspiracy charge, are relevant to the issue before us.</p><p>Count One alleged that during the period between early 1988 and late 1990, petitioner violated \xc2\xa7 8481 by engaging in</p><p>1 Section 848(c) provides:</p><p>"(c) \'Continuing criminal enterprise\' defined</p><p>"For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a person is engaged in a continuing criminal enterprise if-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="295">295</a></p><p>a CCE that consisted of a series of unlawful acts involving the distribution of cocaine.2 The count alleged that these actions were undertaken "in concert with at least five (5) other persons," that petitioner supervised those other persons, and that he obtained substantial income from the continuing series of violations. App. 2-3.</p><p>Count Two separately alleged that during the same period, petitioner violated 21 U. s. C. \xc2\xa7 846 3 by conspiring with four codefendants and others to engage in the unlawful distribution of cocaine. The count alleged that each of the conspirators had furthered the conspiracy by performing an overt act involving the delivery, purchase, or distribution of cocaine. App.3-5.</p><p>After a 9-day trial, a jury found petitioner guilty on all counts. The trial court entered judgment of conviction on both Count One and Count Two and imposed a sentence of life imprisonment without possible release on each count, the sentences to be served concurrently. <i>Id., </i>at 8-10. Pursuant to 18 U. s.

The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit accepted the premise of his argument, namely, that the conspiracy charge was a lesser included offense of the CCE charge. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/40/879/">40 F.3d 879</a>, 886 (1994). The Court of Appeals nonetheless affirmed his convictions and sentences. Relying on its earlier decision in <i>United States </i>v. <i>Bond, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/847/1233/">847 F.2d 1233</a>, 1238 (1988), and our decision in <i>Jeffers </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html">432 U. S. 137</a> (1977), it held that convictions and concurrent sentences may be imposed for conspiracy and CCE, "provided the cumulative punishment does not exceed the maximum under the CCE act." 40</p><p>The decision of the Seventh Circuit is at odds with the practice of other Circuits. Most federal courts that have confronted the question hold that only one judgment should be entered when a defendant is found guilty on both a CCE count and a conspiracy count based on the same agreements.4 The Second and Third Circuits have adopted an intermediate position, allowing judgment to be entered on both counts but permitting only one sentence rather than the concurrent sen-</p><p>4 See, <i>e. g., United States </i>v. <i>Rivera-Martinez, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/931/148/">931 F.2d 148</a>, 153 <i>(CA1), </i>eert. denied, 502 U.

That question could be answered affirmatively only by assuming that while the \xc2\xa7 846 conspiracy requires proof of an actual agreement among the parties, the "in concert" element of the eeE offense might be satisfied by something less.</p><p>The Government advanced this precise argument in <i>Jef</i>fers v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/432/137/case.html">432 U.

The Government need not prove any of those elements to establish a conspiracy in violation of \xc2\xa7 846. Even the "in concert" element of the CCE offense is broader than any requirement in \xc2\xa7 846 because it requires at least five participants, while a conspiracy requires only two.</p><p>S In <i>Jeffers, </i>we considered whether the Government could prosecute the defendant under \xc2\xa7 848 even though he had previously been convicted of \xc2\xa7 846 conspiracy on the basis of the same agreements. The Government argued that the multiple prosecution was permissible because the crimes were not the "same offense." "The Government\'s position is premised on its contention that agreement is not an essential element of the \xc2\xa7 848 offense, despite the presence in \xc2\xa7 848(b)(2)(A) of the phrase \'in concert with.\' If five \'innocent dupes\' each separately acted \'in concert with\' the ringleader of the continuing criminal enterprise, the Government asserts, the statutory requirement would be satisfied.

This suggests that Congress intended the same words to have the same meaning in \xc2\xa7 848 ....

So construed, \xc2\xa7 846 is a lesser included offense of \xc2\xa7 848, because \xc2\xa7 848 requires proof of every fact necessary to show a violation under \xc2\xa7 846 as well as proof of several additional elements." <i>Id., </i>at 149-150.</p><p>In the years since <i>Jeffers </i>was decided, the Courts of Appeals have also consistently rejected the Government\'s interpretation of the "in concert" language of \xc2\xa7 848; they have concluded, without exception, that conspiracy is a lesser included offense of CCE.ll We think it is appropriate now to resolve the point definitively: For the reasons set forth in <i>Jeffers, </i>and particularly because the plain meaning of the phrase "in concert" signifies mutual agreement in a common plan or enterprise, we hold that this element of the CCE offense requires proof of a conspiracy that would also violate \xc2\xa7 846. Because \xc2\xa7 846 does not require proof of any fact that is not also a part of the CCE offense, a straightforward application of the <i>Blockburger </i>test leads to the conclusion that conspiracy as defined in \xc2\xa7 846 does not define a different offense from the CCE offense defined in \xc2\xa7 848. Furthermore, since the latter offense is the more serious of the two, and because only one of its elements is necessary to prove a \xc2\xa7 846 conspiracy, it is appropriate to characterize \xc2\xa7 846 as a lesser included offense of \xc2\xa7 848.12</p><p>11 See, <i>e. g., Rivera-Martinez, </i>931 F. 2d, at 152 <i>(CA1); Aiello, </i>771 F. 2d, at 633 <i>(CA2); Neal, </i>27 F. 3d, at 1054 <i>(CA5); United States </i>v. <i>Chambers, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/944/1253/">944 F.2d 1253</a>, 1268 <i>(CA6 </i>1991), cert. denied, 502 U.

We explained further:</p><blockquote><p>\n"The second conviction, whose concomitant sentence is served concurrently, does not evaporate simply because of the concurrence of the sentence. The separate <i>conviction, </i>apart from the concurrent sentence, has potential adverse collateral consequences that may not be ignored. For example, the presence of two convictions on the record may delay the defendant\'s eligibility for parole or result in an increased sentence under a recidivist statute for a future offense. Moreover, the second conviction may be used to impeach the defendant\'s credibility and certainly carries the societal stigma accompanying any criminal conviction. See <i>Benton </i>v. <i>Maryland, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/784/case.html">395 U.

We need not conclusively resolve the matter, for there is no doubt that the second conviction carried with it, at very least, a $50 assessment. Although petitioner did not challenge the assessment below, 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 3013 required the District Court to impose it, and the assessment was therefore as much a collateral consequence of the conspiracy conviction as the con-</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="303">303</a></p><p>sequences recognized by <i>Ball </i>would be. As a result, the conviction amounts to cumulative punishment not authorized by Congress.</p><p align="center">\nIV</p><p>The Government further argues that even if the second conviction amounts to punishment, the presumption against allowing multiple punishments for the same crime may be overcome if Congress clearly indicates that it intended to allow courts to impose them. <i>Hunter, </i>459 U.

The Government submits that such clear intent can be found here.</p><p>The Government finds support for its position in this Court\'s judgment in <i>Jeffers </i>because that judgment allowed convictions under both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 846 and 848 to stand. Those convictions, however, had been entered in separate trials and our review only addressed the conviction under \xc2\xa7 848. The Court affirmed that conviction not because anyone on the Court suggested that Congress had intended to authorize dual convictions for the same offense,13 but rather because the four-Justice plurality decided that Jeffers had waived any right to object to Jeffers\' prosecution for that conviction, see <i>Jeffers, </i>432 U.

Because neither the Court nor the parties addressed the issue, <i>Jeffers </i>is a singularly unlikely source for a holding that Congress clearly authorized multiple convictions.

In Part II of this opinion we have rejected that view. Accordingly, even if we could infer that the plurality had silently reached the rather bizarre conclusion that Congress intended to allow dual convictions but to preclude other multiple punishments, only four Justices would have supported it, with four others explicitly disagreeing. As to this issue, then, the judgment amounts at best to nothing more than an unexplained affirmance by an equally divided court-a judgment not entitled to precedential weight no matter what reasoning may have supported it. See <i>Neil </i>v. <i>Biggers, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/409/188/case.html">409 U. S. 188</a>, 192 (1972). The more important message conveyed by <i>Jeffers </i>is found not in the bare judgment, but in the plurality\'s conclusion, joined by the four dissenters, that CCE and conspiracy are insufficiently distinct to justify a finding that Congress intended to allow punishments for both when they rest on the same activity.14</p><p>14 The Government suggests that convictions are authorized for both \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 846 and 848 because they are different sections of the United States Code. Brief for United States 16. This does not rise to the level of the clear statement necessary for us to conclude that despite the identity of the statutory elements, Congress intended to allow multiple punishments. Mter all, we concluded in <i>Ball </i>that the statutes at issue did not authorize separate convictions, and they were even more distant in the Code. See 470 U. S., at 863-864 (discussing 18 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 922(h) and 18 U. S. C. App. \xc2\xa7 1202(a) (1984)). If anything, the proximity of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 846 and 848 indicates that Congress understood them to be directed to similar, rather than separate, evils. Cf. <i>Albernaz </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/333/case.html">450 U.

None of its arguments, however, demonstrates that Congress "specially authorized" convictions for both the greater and lesser included offenses we address today. <i>Whalen, </i>445 U. S., at 693. The Government suggests, for example, that the statutes in <i>Ball </i>were directed at virtually identical activity, while CCE and conspiracy are not. As we have already concluded, however, every proof of a CCE will demonstrate a conspiracy based on the same facts.

We find the argument unpersuasive, for there is no reason why this pair of greater and lesser offenses should present any novel problem beyond that posed by any other greater and lesser included offenses, for which the courts have already developed rules to avoid the perceived danger.</p><p>In <i>Tinder </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/345/565/case.html">345 U.
