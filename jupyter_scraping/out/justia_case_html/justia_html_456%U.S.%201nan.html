The companion Part A Medicare program covers institutional health costs such as hospital expenses.  Part B supplements Part A\'s coverage by insuring against a portion of some medical expenses, such as certain physician services and X-rays, that are excluded from the Part A program. Eligible individuals pay monthly premiums if they choose to enroll in Part B.  These premiums, together with contributions from the Federal </p><p><a class="page-number" name="203">Page 456 U. S. 203</a></p><p> Government, are deposited in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund that finances the Part B program.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1395j, 1395r, 1395s, 1395t, and 1395w (1976 ed. and Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>The Secretary of Health and Human Services administers the Medicare program.  "In order to provide for the administration of the benefits . . . with maximum efficiency and convenience for individuals entitled to benefits," the Secretary is authorized to assign the task of paying Part B claims from the Trust Fund to private insurance carriers experienced in such matters. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  \xc2\xa7 1395u.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 213, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 46 (1965); S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 53 (1965).  After Part B enrollees receive medical care, they (or, after their assignment, their medical providers) bill the private insurance carrier.</p>\n<p>If the carrier determines that a claim meets all Part B coverage criteria such as medical necessity and reasonable cost, the carrier pays the claim out of the federal funds.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u; <em>Schweiker v. McClure, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/188/case.html">456 U. S. 188</a></span>.  If the carrier decides that reimbursement in full is not warranted, the statute and the regulations designate an appeal procedure available to dissatisfied claimants.  All may request a "review determination," which is a <em>de novo</em> written review hearing before a carrier employee different from the one who initially decided the claim.  Claimants who remain dissatisfied and whose appeal involves more than $100 then may petition for an oral hearing before a hearing officer designated by the carrier.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3)(C); 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 405.820 (1980).  Unless the carrier or the hearing officer decides to reopen the proceeding, the hearing officer\'s decision is "final and binding upon all parties to the hearing. . . ."  \xc2\xa7 405.835.  Neither the statute nor the Secretary\'s regulations make further provision for review of hearing officer decisions. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="204">Page 456 U.

About half of such sales were covered by the Part B program.  Persons purchasing dialysis supplies assigned their Medicare Part B claims to respondent.  <em>See</em> 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 426(e); \xc2\xa7 426-1 (1976 ed., Supp. IV) (establishing Part B coverage for renal disease).  Respondent in turn billed the Prudential Insurance Company of America, the private insurance carrier for the New Jersey area in which it is based.  According to its contract with the Secretary, Prudential was required to reimburse 80% of what it determined to be a "reasonable charg[e]" for these supplies.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 13951(a) (1976 ed., Supp. IV).</p>\n<p>Prudential interpreted the relevant statute and regulations to define the "reasonable charges" for respondent\'s products to be their catalog price as of July 1 of the <em>preceding</em> calendar year. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  For example, Prudential reimbursed respondent\'s Part B invoices from July 1, 1975, to June 30, 1976, on the basis of prices contained in respondent\'s July 1, 1974, catalog.</p>\n<p>Prudential began reimbursing respondent on this basis in 1974.  Early in 1976, the respondent learned about the grounds for Prudential\'s partial reimbursement of its invoices.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="205">Page 456 U. S. 205</a></p><p> At that time, it requested Prudential to adjust past and future reimbursements to reflect price increases effective after July 1, 1974.  Prudential agreed to adjust prospectively the basis for payment for the drug heparin, the price of which apparently had increased sharply.  <em>Cf.</em> U.S. Dept. of HEW, Medicare Part B Carriers Manual \xc2\xa7 5010.2 (1980) (permitting adjustments to customary charges in "highly unusual situations where equity clearly indicates that the increases are warranted").  But the carrier refused to make either retroactive adjustments for heparin or any adjustments at all for other products. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Respondent sought review of this refusal before one of Prudential\'s hearing officers pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3)(C).  The hearing officer affirmed Prudential\'s decision.  Respondent then brought the instant action against the United States in the Court of Claims seeking reimbursement on the basis of its current charges, asserting that Prudential\'s refusal to set "reasonable charges" on the basis of respondent\'s interim price increases contravened the Fifth Amendment, as well as the Social Security Act and applicable regulations.  The Court of Claims ruled that respondent\'s suit was within the jurisdictional grant of the Tucker Act, 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1491, which permits the Court of Claims to hear</p>\n<p>"any claim against the United States founded either upon the Constitution, or any Act of Congress, or any regulation of an executive department."</p>\n<p>225 Ct.Cl. 252, 256-262, 634 F.2d 580, 584-588 (1980) (en banc), <em>opinion clarified,</em> 225 Ct.Cl. 273, 647 F.2d 129 (1981). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  On the merits, the court decided that Prudential\'s calculation of respondent\'s </p><p><a class="page-number" name="206">Page 456 U. S. 206</a></p><p> maximum allowable charge erred in several respects.  225 Ct.Cl. at 262-268, 634 F.2d a 588-590.  The court remanded the case to Prudential for redetermination of these matters. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  We granted certiorari to determine whether the Court of Claims has jurisdiction over suits of this kind.  451 U.S. 982 (1981).  We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The United States argues that Congress, by enacting the Medicare statute, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395j <em>et seq.</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. IV), specifically precluded review in the Court of Claims of adverse hearing officer determinations of the amount of Part B payments.  We agree. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>Our lodestar is the language of the statute.  Congress has specified in the Medicare statute that disputed carrier Part B determinations are to be subject to review in "a fair hearing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="207">Page 456 U. S. 207</a></p><p> by the <em>carrier,</em> in any case where the amount in controversy is $100 or more. . . ."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3)(C) (emphasis added). [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>See Schweiker v. McClure, ante</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/188/case.html">456 U. S. 88</a></span>.  Congress also provided explicitly for review by the <em>Secretary</em> of</p>\n<p>"determination[s] of whether an individual is <em>entitled</em> to benefits under part A or part B, and [of] the determination of the <em>amount</em> of benefits under <em>part A.</em> . . ."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 1395ff(a) (emphasis added).  Individuals dissatisfied with the Secretary\'s decision on such matters are granted the right to additional administrative review, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] together with a further option of judicial review, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] in two instances only:  when the dispute relates to their eligibility to participate in either Part A or Part B and when the dispute concerns the amount of benefits to which they are entitled under Part A.  \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b). [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="208">Page 456 U. S. 208</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Section 1395ff thus distinguishes between two types of administrative decisions:  eligibility determinations (that decide whether an individual is 65 or over or "disabled" within the meaning of the Medicare program) and amount determinations (that decide the amount of the Medicare payment to be made on a particular claim).  Conspicuously, the statute fails to authorize further review for determinations of the amount of Part B awards.  In the context of the statute\'s precisely drawn provisions, this omission provides persuasive evidence that Congress deliberately intended to foreclose further review of such claims.  <em>See, e.g., Lehman v. Nakshian,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/case.html">453 U. S. 156</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/453/156/case.html#162">453 U. S. 162</a></span>-163 (1981); <em>Fedorenko v.

S. 512</a></span>-513 (1981).</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>The legislative history confirms this view, and explains its logic.  The Committee Reports accompanying the original enactment of the Medicare program stated that the supplemental payments under the Part B program generally were expected to be smaller than those under the primary Part A program.  Apparently, it was for this reason that the proposed bill did not provide for judicial review of "a determination concerning the amount of benefits under [P]art B. . . ."  S.Rep. No. 404, 89th Cong., 1st Sess., 55 (1965). [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="209">Page 456 U. S. 209</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This intent to limit the review of the generally smaller Part B awards was reiterated when Congress amended \xc2\xa7 1395ff(b) in 1972. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  When introducing this amendment, Senator Bennett stated that it was intended to clarify the intent of existing law, which "greatly restricted" the appealability of Medicare decisions "in order to avoid overloading the courts with quite minor matters."  118 Cong.Rec. 33992 (1972).  The Senator explained that the amendment would assure that judicial review would be available as to questions of "eligibility </p><p><a class="page-number" name="210">Page 456 U. S. 210</a></p><p> to any benefits of medicare but not [as] to decisions on a claim for payment for a given service." [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The Conference Committee advanced an identical explanation for this amendment:</p>\n<p>"<em>CLARIFICATION OF MEDICARE APPEAL PROCEDURES" </em></p>\n<p>"Amendment No. 561:  The Senate amendment added a new section to the House bill which would make clear that there is no authorization for an appeal to the Secretary or for judicial review on matters solely involving amounts of benefits under Part B, and that, insofar as Part A amounts are concerned, appeal is authorized only if the amount in controversy is $100 or more and judicial review only if the amount in controversy is $1,000 or more."</p>\n<p>"The House recedes."</p>\n<p>H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 92-1605, p. 61 (1972). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="211">Page 456 U. S. 211</a></p><p></p>\n<p>These expressions of legislative intent unambiguously support our reading of the statutory language.  Respondent advances no persuasive evidence of contrary congressional will.  In such circumstances, our task is at an end. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Claims is reversed.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, the private insurance carrier involved in this suit is the Prudential Insurance Company of America.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>Claimants\' reimbursable "reasonable charge" cannot exceed the "prevailing charge" calculated for "the locality."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1395u(b)(3) (1976 ed. and Supp. IV).  In an effort to control the extent to which the Medicare program contributes to the inflation of medical costs, the "prevailing charge" formula is based on typical local rates for the <em>preceding</em> year.  <em>See</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 405.504(a)(2)(i) (1980) (defining "prevailing charge" as the fee that "would cover 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during the calendar year <em>preceding</em> the start of the 12-month period (beginning July 1 of each year) in which the claim is submitted or the request for payment is made") (emphasis added).

Mr. President, the purpose of the amendment is to make sure existing law, which gives the right of a person to go to court on the question of eligibility to receive welfare, is not interpreted to mean he can take the question of the Federal claim to court.  If he did, we would never have an end to it.  This is to reconfirm the original intention of the law that the courts can determine only eligibility."</p>\n<p>"The situations in which medicare decisions are appealable to the courts were intended in the original law to be greatly restricted in order to avoid overloading the courts with quite minor matters.  The law refers to \'entitlement\' as being an issue subject to court review, and the word was intended to mean eligibility to any benefits of medicare, but not to decisions on a claim for payment for a given service."</p>\n<p>"If judicial review is made available where any claim is denied, as some court decisions have held, the resources of the Federal court system would be unduly taxed, and little real value would be derived by the enrollees.  The proposed amendment would merely clarify the original intent of the law, and prevent the overloading of the courts with trivial matters because the intent is considered unclear."</p>\n<p>118 Cong.Rec. 33992 (1972).</p>\n<p>The Senate agreed to the amendment without further discussion.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition to its substantive money claim assertedly arising under the Medicare statute, respondent argues that it derives such a substantive claim from an implied-in-fact contract with the United States, or as a third-party beneficiary to Prudential\'s contract with the United States.  These arguments fail because any such contracts with the United States necessarily would include the statutory preclusion of review of hearing officers\' determinations regarding the amount of Part B benefits.</p>\n<p>In response to questioning at oral argument, respondent\'s counsel answered that it was asserting a constitutional right to judicial review of Prudential\'s Part B determination.
