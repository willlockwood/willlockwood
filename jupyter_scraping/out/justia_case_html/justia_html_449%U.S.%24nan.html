In June, 1975, the injunction was dissolved by an appellate court as having been illegally issued.  Respondents then filed a complaint in the United States District Court purporting to state a cause of action for damages under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Defendants were the Duval County Ranch Co., Inc., which had obtained the injunction, the sole owner of the corporation, the judge who entered the injunction, and the two individual </p><p><a class="page-number" name="26">Page 449 U. S. 26</a></p><p> sureties.on the injunction bond, one of whom is now petitioner in this Court.  Essentially, the claim was that the injunction had been corruptly issued as the result of a conspiracy between the judge and the other defendants, thus causing a deprivation of property, <em>i.e.,</em> two years of oil production, without due process of law.</p>\n<p>All defendants moved to dismiss, the judge asserting judicial immunity and the other defendants urging dismissal for failure to allege action "under color" of state law, a necessary component of a \xc2\xa7 1983 cause of action.  The District Court concluded that, because the injunction was a judicial act within the jurisdiction of the state court, the judge was immune from liability in a \xc2\xa7 1983 suit, whether or not the injunction had issued as the result of a corrupt conspiracy.  Relying on <em>Haldane v. Chagnon,</em> 345 F.2d 601 (CA9 1965), the District Court also ruled that, with the dismissal of the judge, the remaining defendants could not be said to have conspired under color of state law within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983.  The action against them was accordingly dismissed "for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted."</p>\n<p>In a per curiam opinion, a panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed, agreeing that the judge was immune from suit and that, because "the remaining defendants, who are all private citizens, did not conspire with any person against whom a valid \xc2\xa7 1983 suit can be stated," <em>Sparks v. Duval County Ranch Co.,</em> 588 F.2d. 124, 126 (1979), existing authorities in the Circuit required dismissal of the claims against these defendants as well. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The case was reconsidered en banc, prior Circuit authority was overruled and the District Court judgment was reversed insofar as it had dismissed claims against the defendants other than the judge.  <em>Sparks v. Duval County Ranch Co.,</em> 604 F.2d </p><p><a class="page-number" name="27">Page 449 U. S. 27</a></p><p> 76 (1979).  The court ruled that there was no good reason in law, logic, or policy for conferring immunity on private persons who persuaded the immune judge to exercise his jurisdiction corruptly.  Because the judgment below was inconsistent with the rulings of other Courts of Appeals [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] and involves an important issue, we granted the petition for certiorari.  445 U.S. 942.  We now affirm.</p>\n<p>Based on the doctrine expressed in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/6/case.html#13">Bradley v. Fisher,</a></span></em> 13 Wall. 335 (1872), this Court has consistently adhered to the rule that</p>\n<p>"judges defending against \xc2\xa7 1983 actions enjoy absolute immunity from damages liability for acts performed in their judicial capacities.  <em>Pierson v. Ray,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/386/547/case.html">386 U. S. 547</a></span> (1967); <em>Stump v. Sparkman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/435/349/case.html">435 U.

The courts below concluded that the judicial immunity doctrine required dismissal of the \xc2\xa7 1983 action against the judge who issued the challenged injunction, and as the case comes to us, the judge has been properly dismissed from the suit on immunity grounds.  It does not follow, however, that the action against the private parties accused of conspiring with the judge must also be dismissed.</p>\n<p>As the Court of Appeals correctly understood our cases to hold, to act "under color of" state law for \xc2\xa7 1983 purposes does not require that the defendant be an officer of the State.  It is enough that he is a willful participant in joint action with the State or its agents.  Private persons, jointly engaged </p><p><a class="page-number" name="28">Page 449 U. S. 28</a></p><p> with state official in the challenged action, are acting "under color" of law for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983 actions.  <em>Adickes v. S. H. Kress &amp; Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/144/case.html">398 U. S. 144</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/398/144/case.html#152">398 U. S. 152</a></span> (1970); <em>United States v.

[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Of course, merely resorting to the court and being on the winning side of a lawsuit does not make a party a coconspirator or a joint actor with the judge.  But here the allegations were that an official act of the defendant judge was the product of a corrupt conspiracy involving bribery of the judge.  Under these allegations, the private parties conspiring with the judge were acting under color of state law; and it is of no consequence in this respect that the judge himself is immune from damages liability.  Immunity does not change the character of the judge\'s action or that of his coconspirators. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Indeed, his </p><p><a class="page-number" name="29">Page 449 U. S. 29</a></p><p> immunity is dependent on the challenged conduct being an official judicial act within his statutory jurisdiction, broadly construed.  <em>Stump v. Sparkman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/349/case.html">435 U. S. 349</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/435/349/case.html#356">435 U. S. 356</a></span> (1978); <em>Bradley v.

Private parties who corruptly conspire with a judge in connection with such conduct are thus acting under color of state law within the meaning of \xc2\xa7 1983 as it has been construed in our prior cases.  The complaint in this case was not defective for failure to allege that the private defendants were acting under color of state law, and the Court of Appeals was correct in rejecting its prior case authority to the contrary.</p>\n<p>Petitioner nevertheless insists that, unless he is held to have an immunity derived from that of the judge, the latter\'s official immunity will be seriously eroded.  We are unpersuaded.  The immunities of state officials that we have recognized for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983 are the equivalents of those that were recognized at common law, <em>Owen v. City of Independence,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/622/case.html">445 U.

S. 554</a></span> (1967), and the burden is on the official claiming immunity to demonstrate his entitlement.  <em>Cf. Butz v. Economou,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/438/478/case.html">438 U.

City of Independence, supra,</em> a municipality\'s claim that it could assert the immunity of its officers and agents in a \xc2\xa7 1983 damages action was rejected, since there was no basis for such a right at common law.  Here, petitioner has pointed to nothing indicating that, historically, judicial immunity insulated from damages liability those private persons who corruptly conspire with the judge. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>In <em>Gravel v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/606/case.html">408 U. S. 606</a></span> (1972), we recognized that the Speech or Debate Clause conferred immunity </p><p><a class="page-number" name="30">Page 449 U. S. 30</a></p><p> upon a Senator\'s aide as well as the Senator, but only in those situations where the conduct of the aide would be a protected legislative act if performed by the Senator himself.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/606/case.html#618">408 U. S. 618</a></span>.  Here, there could be no claim that petitioner or any of the other private parties was actually performing a judicial act or was in any sense an official aide of the judge.  Not surprisingly, petitioner does not argue that judges must conspire with private parties in order that judicial duties may be properly accomplished.</p>\n<p>It is urged that, if petitioner and other private coconspirators of the judge are to be subject to \xc2\xa7 1983 damages actions and if a case such as this is to go to trial, the charge of conspiracy and judicial corruption will necessarily be aired and decided, the consequence being that the judge, though not a party and immune from liability, will be heavily involved, very likely as a witness forced to testify about and defend his judicial conduct.  It is true that, based on the Speech or Debate Clause, we have held that Members of Congress need not respond to questions about their legislative acts, <em>Gravel v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/606/case.html#616">408 U. S. 616</a></span>-617; and, in general, the scope of state legislative immunity for purposes of \xc2\xa7 1983 has been patterned after immunity under the Speech or Debate Clause.  <em>Supreme Court of Virginia v. Consumers Union,</em> 446 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/446/719/case.html#732">446 U. S. 732</a></span>-734.  But there is no similar constitutionally based privilege immunizing judges from being required to testify about their judicial conduct in third-party litigation.  Nor has any demonstration been made that, historically, the doctrine of judicial immunity not only protected the judge from liability but also excused him from responding as a witness when his coconspirators are sued.  Even if the judge were excused from testifying, it would not follow that actions against private parties must be dismissed.</p>\n<p>Of course, testifying takes time and energy that otherwise might be devoted to judicial duties; and, if cases such as this </p><p><a class="page-number" name="31">Page 449 U. S. 31</a></p><p> survive initial challenge and go to trial, the judge\'s integrity and that of the judicial process may be at stake in such cases.  But judicial immunity was not designed to insulate the judiciary from all aspects of public accountability.  Judges are immune from 1983 damages actions, but they are subject to criminal prosecutions as are other citizens.  <em>O\'Shea v. Littleton,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html">414 U. S. 488</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/488/case.html#503">414 U. S. 503</a></span> (1974).  Neither are we aware of any rule generally exempting a judge from the normal obligation to respond as a witness when he has information material to a criminal or civil proceeding. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  <em>Cf. United States v. Nixon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html">418 U. S. 683</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html#705">418 U. S. 705</a></span>-707 (1974).</p>\n<p>Judicial immunity arose because it was in the public interest to have judges who were at liberty to exercise their independent judgment about the merits of a case without fear of being mulcted for damages should an unsatisfied litigant be able to convince another tribunal that the judge acted not only mistakenly but with malice and corruption.  <em>Pierson v. Ray, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/386/547/case.html#554">386 U. S. 554</a></span>; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/80/335/case.html#349">Bradley v.

In terms of undermining a judge\'s independence and his judicial performance, the concern that his conduct will be examined in a collateral proceeding against those with whom he allegedly conspired, a proceeding in which he cannot be held liable for damages and which he need not defend, is not of the same order of magnitude as the prospects of being a defendant in a damages action from complaint to verdict with the attendant possibility of being held liable for damages if the factfinder mistakenly upholds the charge of malice or of a corrupt conspiracy with others.  These concerns are not insubstantial, either for the judge or for the public, but we agree with the Court of Appeals that the potential harm to the public from denying immunity to private coconspirators </p><p><a class="page-number" name="32">Page 449 U.
