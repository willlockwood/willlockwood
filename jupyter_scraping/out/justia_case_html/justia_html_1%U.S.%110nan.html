He insisted that the evidence given by Meng on the present trial could not affect him in a civil action; and observed, that if any thing relative to the civil action should decide the case before the court, the probability was, that Meng\'s testimony would be favourable to the prisoner; for if Meng swears the note to be false, he can gain nothing; but if he proves it to be true, he testifies against his own interest. </p><p> Lewis, in reply, acknowledged that the evidence given on this trial, could not be offered in favour of Meng on another; but he urged, that if the note itself were proved to be forged, it might be detained by the court and not suffered afterwards to be sued; on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 1 U.S. 110, 111</a></p><p> the same principle that it is said in 6 Co. 45. \'the court will damn a bond, on which the obligee has recovered.\' </p><p></p><p> M\'Kean, Chief Justice. </p><p> The court will not detain a note or bond in the circumstances mentioned.
