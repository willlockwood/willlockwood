The District Court granted respondent\'s motion for summary judgment and the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/636/1217/">636 F.2d 1217</a> (1980). Chief Judge Edwards dissented, reasoning that summary judgment is improperly invoked where, as here, the defendant\'s motive and intent in discharging the plaintiff is at issue.

In Arnstein v. Porter, 154 F.2d 464, 469 (1946), for example, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit fully explored the circumstances in which summary judgment could be granted and concluded that "[a]lthough part of plaintiff\'s testimony on deposition (as to \'stooges\' and the like) does seem \'fantastic,\' yet plaintiff\'s credibility, even as to those improbabilities, should be left to the jury." And this Court has recently questioned the propriety of deciding defamation cases on summary judgment where the defendant\'s state of mind is called into question under the " actual malice" standard.

Summary judgment simply may not be granted when such matters as the defendant\'s motive and intent are questioned. Thus in any suit where the defendant is not accorded absolute immunity, so that the defendant\'s state of mind is at issue, it will not require an ingenious advocate to force a trial of the case. It seems to me that even the most frivolous lawsuits filed against top-level federal officials will have to be tried. Indeed, that is one reason why I dissented in Butz v. Economou, supra, at 517 (concurring in part and dissenting in part), and remained convinced that the case was wrongly decided.</p></ul> <p> Just as summary judgment is inappropriate in qualified-immunity cases and in defamation cases, it is inappropriate here. Because petitioner raised issues going to respondent\'s motive and intent, it was error to grant the motion for summary judgment. Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of the petition for certiorari.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
