We reverse.</p>\n<p>Petitioner is the mother of Ivan Firecrow.  On July 1, 1969, after petitioner and Ivan\'s father were divorced, the Tribal Court of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe found that petitioner had neglected Ivan, awarded temporary custody to Josephine Runsabove, and made Ivan a ward of the court. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  In 1973, the Tribal Court rejected petitioner\'s request to regain custody of her son. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On August 30, 1974, however, the Tribal Court entered an order granting petitioner temporary custody of Ivan "for a period of six weeks during the summer months." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>Four days before the entry of that order, Josephine Runsabove and her husband initiated an adoption proceeding in the District Court for the Sixteenth Judicial District of Montana. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  Petitioner moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, asserting that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 424 U. S. 384</a></p><p> Tribal Court possessed exclusive jurisdiction.  After a hearing, the District Court certified to the Appellate Court of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe the question whether an ordinance of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] conferred jurisdiction upon the District Court.  The Appellate Court of the Tribe expressed the opinion that it did not, [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and the State District Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 424 U. S. 385</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Runaboves then filed an original application in the Montana Supreme Court for a writ of supervisory control or other appropriate writ to set aside the order of dismissal.  The Montana Supreme Court granted the requested relief, holding that the District Court possessed jurisdiction.  The court reasoned that, prior to the organization of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe in 1935, the Montana courts possessed jurisdiction over adoptions involving tribal members residing on the reservation, and that this jurisdiction could not be unilaterally divested by tribal ordinance; that Congress recognized that jurisdiction of state courts over Indian adoptions in 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 372a; and that depriving the Montana court of jurisdiction would deny equal protection to Indian plaintiffs, at least under the Montana Constitution.  <em>State ex rel.

S. 179</a></span>-180 (1973).</p>\n<p>The right of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe to govern itself independently of state law has been consistently protected by federal statute.  As early as 1877, Congress ratified an agreement between the Tribe and the United States providing that</p>\n<p>"Congress shall, by appropriate legislation, secure to [the Indians] an orderly government; they shall be subject to the laws of the United States, and each individual shall be protected in his rights of property, person, and life."</p>\n<p>19 Stat. 256.  This provision remained unaffected by the Act enabling Montana to enter the Union, [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] and by the other statutes specifically concerned with the Northern Cheyenne Tribe. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 424 U. S. 387</a></p><p> In 1935, the Tribe adopted a constitution and bylaws [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>] pursuant to \xc2\xa7 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 48 Stat. 987, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 476, a statute specifically intended to encourage Indian tribes to revitalize their self-government.  <em>Mescalero Apache Tribe, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/145/case.html#151">411 U. S. 151</a></span>.  Acting pursuant to the constitution and bylaws, the Tribal Council of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe established the Tribal Court and granted it jurisdiction over adoptions "among members of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe." [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>State court jurisdiction plainly would interfere with the powers of self-government conferred upon the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and exercised through the Tribal Court.  It would subject a dispute arising on the reservation among reservation Indians to a forum other than </p><p><a class="page-number" name="388">Page 424 U. S. 388</a></p><p> the one they. have established for themselves. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  As the present record illustrates, it would create a substantial risk of conflicting adjudications affecting the custody of the child, and would cause a corresponding decline in the authority of the Tribal Court.</p>\n<p>No federal statute sanctions this interference with tribal self-government.  Montana has not been granted, nor has it assumed, civil jurisdiction over the Northern Cheyenne Indian Reservation, either under the Act of Aug. 15, 1953, 67 Stat. 588, or under Title IV of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, 82 Stat. 78, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1321 <em>et seq.</em>  And, contrary to the Runsaboves\' contention, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 372a [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>] manifests no congressional intent to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="389">Page 424 U. S. 389</a></p><p> confer jurisdiction upon state courts over adoptions by Indians.  The statute is concerned solely with the documentation necessary to prove adoption by an Indian in proceedings before the Secretary of the Interior.  It recognizes adoption "by a judgment or decree of a State court" as one means of documentation, but nowhere addresses the jurisdiction of sate courts to render such judgments or decrees.  The statute does not confer jurisdiction upon the Montana courts.  <em>See McClanahan,</em> 411 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/411/164/case.html#174">411 U. S. 174</a></span>-175; <em>Williams,</em> 358 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/217/case.html#220">358 U. S. 220</a></span>-221.</p>\n<p>Since the adoption proceeding is appropriately characterized as litigation arising on the Indian reservation, the jurisdiction of the Tribal Court is exclusive.  The Runsaboves have not sought to defend the state court\'s jurisdiction by arguing that any substantial part of the conduct supporting the adoption petition took place off the reservation.  <em>Cf. DeCoteau v. District County Court,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/425/case.html">420 U. S. 425</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/425/case.html#428">420 U. S. 428</a></span>-430, and n. 3 (1975). [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 424 U. S. 390</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The remaining points may be dealt with briefly.  The Runsaboves argue that the ordinances of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe could not deprive the Montana courts of the jurisdiction they exercised over tribal matters prior to organization of the Tribe in 1935.  The tribal ordinance conferring jurisdiction on the Tribal Court was authorized by \xc2\xa7 16 of the Indian Reorganization Act, 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 476.  Consequently, it implements an overriding federal policy which is clearly adequate to defeat state jurisdiction over litigation involving reservation Indians.  Accordingly, even if we assume that the Montana courts properly exercised adoption jurisdiction prior to the organization of the Tribe, a question we do not decide, that jurisdiction has now been preempted.</p>\n<p>Finally we reject the argument that denying the Runsaboves access to the Montana courts constitutes impermissible racial discrimination.  The exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribal Court does not derive from the race of the plaintiff, but rather from the <em>quasi</em>-sovereign status of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe under federal law.  Moreover, even if a jurisdictional holding occasionally results in denying an Indian plaintiff a forum to which a non-Indian </p><p><a class="page-number" name="391">Page 424 U. S. 391</a></p><p> has access, such disparate treatment of the Indian is justified because it is intended to benefit the class of which he is a member by furthering the congressional policy of Indian self-government.  <em>Morton v.

The statute provides:</p>\n<p>"[SEC. 1] [I]n probate matters under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Interior, no person shall be recognized as an heir of a deceased Indian by virtue of an adoption -- "</p>\n<p>"(1) Unless such adoption shall have been -- "</p>\n<p>"(a) by a judgment or decree of a State court;"</p>\n<p>"(b) by a judgment or decree of an Indian court;"</p>\n<p>"(c) by a written adoption approved by the superintendent of the agency having jurisdiction over the tribe of which either the adopted child or the adoptive parent is a member, and duly recorded in a book kept by the superintendent for that purpose; or"</p>\n<p>"(d) by an adoption in accordance with a procedure established by the tribal authority, recognized by the Department of the Interior, of the tribe either of the adopted child or the adoptive parent, and duly recorded in a book kept by the tribe for that purpose; or"</p>\n<p>"(2) Unless such adoption shall have been recognized by the Department of the Interior prior to the effective date of this Act or in the distribution of the estate of an Indian who has died prior to that date:  <em>Provided,</em> That an adoption by Indian custom made prior to the effective date of this Act may be made valid by recordation with the superintendent if both the adopted child and the adoptive parent are still living, if the adoptive parent requests that the adoption be recorded, and if the adopted child is an adult and makes such a request or the superintendent on behalf of a minor child approves of the recordation."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.  This Act shall not apply with respect to the distribution of the estates of Indians of the Five Civilized Tribes or the Osage Tribe in the State of Oklahoma, or with respect to the distribution of estates of Indians who have died prior to the effective date of this Act."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T14" name="F14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>The Runsaboves alleged as grounds for adoption that petitioner had abandoned Ivan and given custody to Josephine Runsabove and that petitioner had not supported the child for over a year.  Since all parties resided on the reservation at all relevant times, and since the reservation has not been partially terminated, <em>cf. DeCoteau v. District Court,</em> 420 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/420/425/case.html#429">420 U. S. 429</a></span> n. 3, it appears that none of the acts giving rise to the adoption proceedings occurred off the reservation.  The Runsaboves do not contend otherwise.  They do, however, point out that the birth of Ivan and the marriage and divorce of his parents occurred off the reservation.  These facts do not affect our conclusion that the adoption proceeding is within the Tribal Court\'s exclusive jurisdiction.  In a proceeding such as an adoption, which determines the permanent status of litigants, it is appropriate to predicate jurisdiction on the residence of the litigants, rather than the location of particular incidents of marginal relevance, at best.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
