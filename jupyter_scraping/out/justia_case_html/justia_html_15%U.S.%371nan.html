CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL.</p>\n<p>The Court is of opinion that the affidavit transmitted from the circuit court may be now read.  But as to the new proof now offered by the claimant, it is the practice of this Court to hear the cause in the first instance upon the evidence transmitted from the circuit court, and to decide upon that evidence whether it is proper to allow further proof.  The new proof cannot, therefore, be now read; but as the opposite party wishes it, the counsel may state the nature of the proof, though not the contents thereof in detail.  If the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 15 U. S. 373</a></p><p> case shall ultimately appear entitled to further proof, an order will be made for that purpose.</p>\n<p>Farther proof was ordered in the cause.</p>\n<p>Mr. D. B. Ogden, for the claimant, offered to read affidavits, as further proof, which had not been taken under a commission.  But they were rejected by the Court, the cause was continued to the next term, and the further proof ordered to be taken under a commission, according to the rule of Court of the present term.</p>\n<p><em>Cause continued.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
