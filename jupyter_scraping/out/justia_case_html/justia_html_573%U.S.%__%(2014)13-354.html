As amended by the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA), RFRA covers \xe2\x80\x9cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x935(7)(A).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At issue here are regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA), which, as relevant here, requires specified employers\xe2\x80\x99 group health plans to furnish \xe2\x80\x9cpreventive care and screenings\xe2\x80\x9d for women without \xe2\x80\x9cany cost sharing requirements,\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9313(a)(4).  Congress did not specify what types of preventive care must be covered; it authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration, a component of HHS, to decide.  Ibid.  Nonexempt employers are generally required to provide coverage for the 20 contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including the 4 that may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.  Religious employers, such as churches, are exempt from this contraceptive mandate.  HHS has also effectively exempted religious nonprofit organizations with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptive services.  Under this accommodation, the insurance issuer must exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer\xe2\x80\x99s plan and provide plan participants with separate payments for contraceptive services without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the employer, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In these cases, the owners of three closely held for-profit corporations have sincere Christian beliefs that life begins at conception and that it would violate their religion to facilitate access to contraceptive drugs or devices that operate after that point.  In separate actions, they sued HHS and other federal officials and agencies (collectively HHS) under RFRA and the Free Exercise Clause, seeking to enjoin application of the contraceptive mandate insofar as it requires them to provide health coverage for the four objectionable contraceptives.  In No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, the District Court denied the Hahns and their company\xe2\x80\x94Conestoga Wood Specialties\xe2\x80\x94a preliminary injunction.  Affirming, the Third Circuit held that a for-profit corporation could not \xe2\x80\x9cengage in religious exercise\xe2\x80\x9d under RFRA or the\n \nFirst Amendment, and that the mandate imposed no requirements on the Hahns in their personal capacity.  In No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, the Greens, their children, and their companies\xe2\x80\x94Hobby Lobby Stores and Mardel\xe2\x80\x94were also denied a preliminary injunction, but the Tenth Circuit reversed.  It held that the Greens\xe2\x80\x99 businesses are \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d under RFRA, and that the corporations had established a likelihood of success on their RFRA claim because the contraceptive mandate substantially burdened their exercise of religion and HHS had not demonstrated a compelling interest in enforcing the mandate against them; in the alternative, the court held that HHS had not proved that the mandate was the \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means\xe2\x80\x9d of furthering a compelling governmental interest. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">Held:\xc2\xa0As applied to closely held corporations, the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violate RFRA.

RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s text shows that Congress designed the statute to provide very broad protection for religious liberty and did not intend to put merchants to such a choice.  It employed the familiar legal fiction of including corporations within RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpersons,\xe2\x80\x9d but the purpose of extending rights to corporations is to protect the rights of people associated with the corporation, including shareholders, officers, and employees.  Protecting the free-exercise rights of closely held corporations thus protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control them.

O Centro Esp\xc3\xadrita Beneficiente Uni\xc3\xa3o do Vegetal,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 418\n.  And HHS\xe2\x80\x99s concession that a nonprofit corporation can be a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d under RFRA effectively dispatches any argument that the term does not reach for-profit corporations; no conceivable definition of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations.

The corporate form alone cannot explain it because RFRA indisputably protects nonprofit corporations.  And the profit-making objective of the corporations cannot explain it because the Court has entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants.  Braunfeld v. Brown,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 599\n.  Business practices compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within the understanding of the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d that this Court set out in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872\n.  Any suggestion that for-profit corporations are incapable of exercising religion because their purpose is simply to make money flies in the face of modern corporate law.  States, including those in which the plaintiff corporations were incorporated, authorize corporations to pursue any lawful purpose or business, including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners\xe2\x80\x99 religious principles.  Pp.\xc2\xa020\xe2\x80\x9325.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (iii)\xc2\xa0Also flawed is the claim that RFRA offers no protection because it only codified pre-Smith Free Exercise Clause precedents, none of which squarely recognized free-exercise rights for for-profit corporations.  First, nothing in RFRA as originally enacted suggested that its definition of \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d was meant to be tied to pre-Smith interpretations of the\n \nFirst Amendment.  Second, if RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s original text were not clear enough, the RLUIPA amendment surely dispels any doubt that Congress intended to separate the definition of the phrase from that in\n \nFirst Amendment case law.  Third, the pre-Smith case of Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 617\n, suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations can exercise religion.  Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty, merely restored this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and restricted RFRA claims to plaintiffs who fell within a category of plaintiffs whose claims the Court had recognized before Smith.

HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  That disputes among the owners of corporations might arise is not a problem unique to this context.  State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure.  Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.

If they and their companies refuse to provide contraceptive coverage, they face severe economic consequences: about $475 million per year for Hobby Lobby, $33 million per year for Conestoga, and $15 million per year for Mardel.  And if they drop coverage altogether, they could face penalties of roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.

HHS has never argued this and the Court does not know its position with respect to the argument.  But even if the Court reached the argument, it would find it unpersuasive:  It ignores the fact that the plaintiffs have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees, and it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty.  Pp.\xc2\xa032\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        (3)\xc2\xa0HHS argues that the connection between what the objecting parties must do and the end that they find to be morally wrong is too attenuated because it is the employee who will choose the coverage and contraceptive method she uses.  But RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s question is whether the mandate imposes a substantial burden on the objecting parties\xe2\x80\x99 ability to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs.  The belief of the Hahns and Greens implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is immoral for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.  It is not for the Court to say that the religious beliefs of the plaintiffs are mistaken or unreasonable.  In fact, this Court considered and rejected a nearly identical argument in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 707\n.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow function .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is to determine\xe2\x80\x9d whether the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 asserted religious belief reflects \xe2\x80\x9can honest conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 716, and there is no dispute here that it does.

Or it could extend the accommodation that HHS has already established for religious nonprofit organizations to non-profit employers with religious objections to the contraceptive mandate.  That accommodation does not impinge on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion and it still serves HHS\xe2\x80\x99s stated interests.

Nor does it provide a shield for employers who might cloak illegal discrimination as a religious practice.  United States v. Lee,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252\n, which upheld the payment of Social Security taxes despite an employer\xe2\x80\x99s religious objection, is not analogous.  It turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation; and if Lee were a RFRA case, the fundamental point would still be that there is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.

We hold that the regulations that impose this obligation violate RFRA, which prohibits the Federal Government from taking any action that substantially burdens the exercise of religion unless that action constitutes the least restrictive means of serving a compelling government interest.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In holding that the HHS mandate is unlawful, we reject HHS\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the owners of the companies for-feited all RFRA protection when they decided to organize their businesses as corporations rather than sole proprietorships or general partnerships.  The plain terms of RFRA make it perfectly clear that Congress did not discriminate in this way against men and women who wish to run their businesses as for-profit corporations in the manner required by their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Since RFRA applies in these cases, we must decide whether the challenged HHS regulations substantially burden the exercise of religion, and we hold that they do.  The owners of the businesses have religious objections to abortion, and according to their religious beliefs the four contraceptive methods at issue are abortifacients.  If the owners comply with the HHS mandate, they believe they will be facilitating abortions, and if they do not comply, they will pay a very heavy price\xe2\x80\x94as much as $1.3 million per day, or about $475 million per year, in the case of one of the companies.  If these consequences do not amount to a substantial burden, it is hard to see what would.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Under RFRA, a Government action that imposes a substantial burden on religious exercise must serve a compelling government interest, and we assume that the HHS regulations satisfy this requirement.  But in order for the HHS mandate to be sustained, it must also constitute the least restrictive means of serving that interest, and the mandate plainly fails that test.  There are other ways in which Congress or HHS could equally ensure that every woman has cost-free access to the particular contraceptives at issue here and, indeed, to all FDA-approved contraceptives.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In fact, HHS has already devised and implemented a system that seeks to respect the religious liberty of religious nonprofit corporations while ensuring that the employees of these entities have precisely the same access to all FDA-approved contraceptives as employees of companies whose owners have no religious objections to providing such coverage.  The employees of these religious nonprofit corporations still have access to insurance coverage without cost sharing for all FDA-approved contracep-tives; and according to HHS, this system imposes no net economic burden on the insurance companies that are required to provide or secure the coverage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although HHS has made this system available to religious nonprofits that have religious objections to the contraceptive mandate, HHS has provided no reason why the same system cannot be made available when the owners of for-profit corporations have similar religious objections.  We therefore conclude that this system constitutes an alternative that achieves all of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s aims while providing greater respect for religious liberty.  And under RFRA, that conclusion means that enforcement of the HHS contraceptive mandate against the objecting parties in these cases is unlawful.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As this description of our reasoning shows, our holding is very specific.  We do not hold, as the principal dissent alleges, that for-profit corporations and other commercial enterprises can \xe2\x80\x9copt out of any law (saving only tax laws) they judge incompatible with their sincerely held religious beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 1 (opinion of Ginsburg, J.).  Nor do we hold, as the dissent implies, that such corporations have free rein to take steps that impose \xe2\x80\x9cdisadvantages .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on others\xe2\x80\x9d or that require \xe2\x80\x9cthe general public [to] pick up the tab.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  And we certainly do not hold or suggest that \xe2\x80\x9cRFRA demands accommodation of a for-profit corporation\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs no matter the impact that accommodation may have on .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. thousands of women employed by Hobby Lobby.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 2.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The effect of the HHS-created accommodation on the women employed by Hobby Lobby and the other companies involved in these cases would be precisely zero.  Under that accommodation, these women would still be entitled to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress enacted RFRA in 1993 in order to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.  RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment came three years after this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources of Ore. v. Smith,\n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 872 (1990)\n, which largely repudiated the method of analyzing free-exercise claims that had been used in  cases like Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0398 (1963), and Wisconsin v. Yoder,\n\n406 U.\xc2\xa0S. 205 (1972)\n.  In determining whether challenged government actions violated the Free Exercise Clause of the\n \nFirst Amendment, those decisions used a balancing test that took into account whether the challenged action imposed a substantial burden on the practice of religion, and if it did, whether it was needed to serve a compelling government interest.  Applying this test, the Court held in Sherbert that an employee who was fired for refusing to work on her Sabbath could not be denied unemployment benefits.  374 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 408\xe2\x80\x93409.  And in Yoder, the Court held that Amish children could not be required to comply with a state law demanding that they remain in school until the age of 16 even though their religion required them to focus on uniquely Amish values and beliefs during their formative adolescent years.  406 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 210\xe2\x80\x93211, 234\xe2\x80\x93236.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In Smith, however, the Court rejected \xe2\x80\x9cthe balancing test set forth in Sherbert.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 883.  Smith concerned two members of the Native American Church who were fired for ingesting peyote for sacramental purposes.  When they sought unemployment benefits, the State of Oregon rejected their claims on the ground that consumption of peyote was a crime, but the Oregon Supreme Court, applying the Sherbert test, held that the denial of benefits violated the Free Exercise Clause.  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 875.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This Court then reversed, observing that use of the Sherbert test whenever a person objected on religious grounds to the enforcement of a generally applicable law \xe2\x80\x9cwould open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind.\xe2\x80\x9d  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 888.  The Court therefore held that, under the\n \nFirst Amendment, \xe2\x80\x9cneutral, generally applicable laws may be applied to religious practices even when not supported by a compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  City of Boerne v. Flores, 521\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S. 507, 514 (1997).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Congress responded to Smith by enacting RFRA.  \xe2\x80\x9c[L]aws [that are] \xe2\x80\x98neutral\xe2\x80\x99 toward religion,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress found, \xe2\x80\x9cmay burden religious exercise as surely as laws intended to interfere with religious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  42\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb(a)(2); see also \xc2\xa72000bb(a)(4).  In order to ensure broad protection for religious liberty, RFRA provides that \xe2\x80\x9cGovernment shall not substantially burden a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  If the Government substantially burdens a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion, under the Act that person is entitled to an exemption from the rule unless the Government \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrates that application of the burden to the person\xe2\x80\x94(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As enacted in 1993, RFRA applied to both the Federal Government and the States, but the constitutional authority invoked for regulating federal and state agencies differed.  As applied to a federal agency, RFRA is based on the enumerated power that supports the particular agency\xe2\x80\x99s work,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] but in attempting to regulate the States and their subdivisions, Congress relied on its power under Section 5 of the\n \nFourteenth Amendment to enforce the\n \nFirst Amendment.  521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 516\xe2\x80\x93517.  In City of Boerne, however, we held that Congress had overstepped its Section 5 authority because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he stringent test RFRA demands\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cfar exceed[ed] any pattern or practice of unconstitutional conduct under the Free Exercise Clause as interpreted in Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 533\xe2\x80\x93534.  See also id., at 532.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Following our decision in City of Boerne, Congress passed the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),\n\n114Stat.\n803,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc et seq.  That statute, enacted under Congress\xe2\x80\x99s Commerce and Spending Clause powers, imposes the same general test as RFRA but on a more limited category of governmental actions.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson,\n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 709\n\xe2\x80\x93716 (2005).  And, what is most relevant for present purposes, RLUIPA amended RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d See \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (importing RLUIPA definition).  Before RLUIPA, RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition made reference to the\n \nFirst Amendment.  See \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (1994 ed.) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of religion under the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  In RLUIPA, in an obvious effort to effect a complete separation from\n \nFirst Amendment case law, Congress deleted the reference to the\n \nFirst Amendment and defined the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d to include \xe2\x80\x9cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x935(7)(A).  And Congress mandated that this concept \xe2\x80\x9cbe construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(g).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        At issue in these cases are HHS regulations promul-gated under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA),\n\n124Stat.\n119.  ACA generally requires employers with 50 or more full-time employees to offer\xe2\x80\x9ca group health plan or group health insurance coverage\xe2\x80\x9d that provides \xe2\x80\x9cminimum essential coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75000A(f)(2); \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74980H(a), (c)(2).  Any covered employer that does not provide such coverage must pay a substantial price.  Specifically, if a covered employer provides group health insurance but its plan fails to comply with ACA\xe2\x80\x99s group-health-plan requirements, the employer may be required to pay $100 per day for each affected \xe2\x80\x9cindividual.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74980D(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  And if the employer decides to stop providing health insurance altogether and at least one full-time employee enrolls in a health plan and qualifies for a subsidy on one of the government-run ACA exchanges, the employer must pay $2,000 per year for each of its full-time employees.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa74980H(a), (c)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Unless an exception applies, ACA requires an employer\xe2\x80\x99s group health plan or group-health-insurance coverage to furnish \xe2\x80\x9cpreventive care and screenings\xe2\x80\x9d for women without \xe2\x80\x9cany cost sharing requirements.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300gg\xe2\x80\x9313(a)(4).  Congress itself, however, did not specify what types of preventive care must be covered.  Instead, Congress authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), a component of HHS, to make that important and sensitive decision.  Ibid.  The HRSA in turn consulted the Institute of Medicine, a nonprofit group of volunteer advisers, in determining which preventive services to require.  See 77 Fed. Reg. 8725\xe2\x80\x938726 (2012).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In August 2011, based on the Institute\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations, the HRSA promulgated the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Preventive Services Guidelines.  See id., at 8725\xe2\x80\x938726, and n. 1; online at http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines (all Internet materials as visited June 26, 2014, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  The Guidelines provide that nonexempt employers are generally required to provide \xe2\x80\x9ccoverage, without cost sharing\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ll Food and Drug Ad-ministration [(FDA)] approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling.\xe2\x80\x9d  77 Fed.\xc2\xa0Reg. 8725 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Although many of the required, FDA-approved methods of contraception work by preventing the fertilization of an egg, four of those methods (those specifically at issue in these cases) may have the effect of preventing an already fertilized egg from developing any further by inhibiting its attachment to the uterus.  See Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9310, n.\xc2\xa04;[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>] FDA, Birth Control: Medicines to Help You.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS also authorized the HRSA to establish exemptions from the contraceptive mandate for \xe2\x80\x9creligious employers.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.131(a).  That category encompasses \xe2\x80\x9cchurches, their integrated auxiliaries, and conventions or associ-ations of churches,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusively religious activities of any religious order.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ibid (citing 26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa76033(a)(3)(A)(i), (iii)).  In its Guidelines,HRSA exempted these organizations from the requirement to cover contraceptive services.  See http://hrsa.gov/womensguidelines.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n         In addition, HHS has effectively exempted certain religious nonprofit organizations, described under HHS regulations as \xe2\x80\x9celigible organizations,\xe2\x80\x9d from the contraceptive mandate.  See 45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.131(b); 78 Fed. Reg. 39874 (2013).  An \xe2\x80\x9celigible organization\xe2\x80\x9d means a nonprofit organization that \xe2\x80\x9cholds itself out as a religious organi-zation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copposes providing coverage for some or all of any contraceptive services required to be covered .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on account of religious objections.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.131(b).  To qualify for this accommodation, an employer must certify that it is such an organization.  \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa7147.131(b)(4).  When a group-health-insurance issuer receives notice that one of its clients has invoked this provision, the issuer must then exclude contraceptive coverage from the employer\xe2\x80\x99s plan and provide separate payments for contraceptive services for plan participants without imposing any cost-sharing requirements on the eligible organization, its insurance plan, or its employee beneficiaries.  \xc2\xa7147.131(c).[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  Al-though this procedure requires the issuer to bear the cost of these services, HHS has determined that this obligation will not impose any net expense on issuers because its cost will be less than or equal to the cost savings resulting from the services.  78 Fed. Reg. 39877.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition to these exemptions for religious organizations, ACA exempts a great many employers from most of its coverage requirements.  Employers providing \xe2\x80\x9cgrandfathered health plans\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94those that existed prior to March 23, 2010, and that have not made specified changes after that date\xe2\x80\x94need not comply with many of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s requirements, including the contraceptive mandate.  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa718011(a), (e).

The first question that we must address is whether this provision applies to regulations that govern the activities of for-profit corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS contends that neither these companies nor their owners can even be heard under RFRA.  According to HHS, the companies cannot sue because they seek to make a profit for their owners, and the owners cannotbe heard because the regulations, at least as a formal mat-ter, apply only to the companies and not to the ownersas individuals.  HHS\xe2\x80\x99s argument would have dramatic consequences.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Consider this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in Braunfeld v. Brown, \n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 599 (1961)\n (plurality opinion).  In that case, five Orthodox Jewish merchants who ran small retail businesses in Philadelphia challenged a Pennsylvania Sunday closing law as a violation of the Free Exercise Clause.  Because of their faith, these merchants closed their shops on Saturday, and they argued that requiring them to remain shut on Sunday threatened them with financial ruin.  The Court entertained their claim (although it ruled against them on the merits), and if a similar claim were raised today under RFRA against a jurisdiction still subject to the Act (for example, the District of Columbia, see\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(2)), the merchants would be entitled to be heard.  According to HHS, however, if these merchants chose to incorporate their businesses\xe2\x80\x94with-out in any way changing the size or nature of their businesses\xe2\x80\x94they would forfeit all RFRA (and free-exercise) rights.  HHS would put these merchants to a difficult choice: either give up the right to seek judicial protection of their religious liberty or forgo the benefits, available to their competitors, of operating as corporations.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As we have seen, RFRA was designed to provide very broad protection for religious liberty.  By enacting RFRA, Congress went far beyond what this Court has held is constitutionally required.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]  Is there any reason to think that the Congress that enacted such sweeping protection put small-business owners to the choice that HHS suggests?  An examination of RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s text, to which we turn in the next part of this opinion, reveals that Congress did no such thing.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As we will show, Congress provided protection for people like the Hahns and Greens by employing a familiar legal fiction: It included corporations within RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cpersons.\xe2\x80\x9d  But it is important to keep in mind that the purpose of this fiction is to provide protection for human beings.  A corporation is simply a form of organization used by human beings to achieve desired ends.  An established body of law specifies the rights and obligations of the people (including shareholders, officers, and employees) who are associated with a corporation in one way or another.  When rights, whether constitutional or statu-tory, are extended to corporations, the purpose is to protect the rights of these people.  For example, extending\n \nFourth Amendment protection to corporations protects the privacy interests of employees and others associated with the company.  Protecting corporations from government seizure of their property without just compensation protects all those who have a stake in the corporations\xe2\x80\x99 financial well-being.  And protecting the free-exercise rights of corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel protects the religious liberty of the humans who own and control those companies.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In holding that Conestoga, as a \xe2\x80\x9csecular, for-profit corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d lacks RFRA protection, the Third Circuit wrote as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cGeneral business corporations do not, separate and apart from the actions or belief systems of their individual owners or employees, exercise religion.

The Dictionary Act makes that clear\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, unless there is something about the RFRA context that \xe2\x80\x9cindicates otherwise,\xe2\x80\x9d the Dictionary Act provides a quick, clear, and affirmative answer to the question whether the companies involved in these cases may be heard.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We see nothing in RFRA that suggests a congressional intent to depart from the Dictionary Act definition, and HHS makes little effort to argue otherwise.

S. 520 (1993)\n (Free Exercise), and HHS concedes that a nonprofit corporation can be  a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of RFRA.  See Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 17; Reply Brief in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 7\xe2\x80\x938.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This concession effectively dispatches any argument that the term \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d as used in RFRA does not reach the closely held corporations involved in these cases.  No known understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d includes some but not all corporations.  The term \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d sometimes encompasses artificial persons (as the Dictionary Act instructs), and it sometimes is limited to natural persons.  But no conceivable definition of the term includes natural persons and nonprofit corporations, but not for-profit corporations.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>]  Cf. Clark v. Martinez,\n\n543 U. S. 371,\n378 (2005)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cTo give th[e] same words a different meaning for each category would be to invent a statute rather than interpret one\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The principal argument advanced by HHS and the principal dissent regarding RFRA protection for Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel focuses not on the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cperson,\xe2\x80\x9d but on the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  According to HHS and the dissent, these corporations are not protected by RFRA because they cannot exercise religion.  Neither HHS nor the dissent, however, provides any persuasive explanation for this conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Is it because of the corporate form?  The corporate form alone cannot provide the explanation because, as we have pointed out, HHS concedes that nonprofit corporations can be protected by RFRA.  The dissent suggests that nonprofit corporations are special because furthering their reli-gious \xe2\x80\x9cautonomy . . . often furthers individual religious freedom as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 15 (quoting Corporation of Presiding Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327,\n342 (1987)\n (Brennan, J., concurring in judgment)).  But this principle appliesequally to for-profit corporations: Furthering their re-ligious freedom also \xe2\x80\x9cfurthers individual religious freedom.\xe2\x80\x9d  In these cases, for example, allowing Hobby Lobby, Con-estoga, and Mardel to assert RFRA claims protects the religious liberty of the Greens and the Hahns.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">21</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If the corporate form is not enough, what about the profit-making objective?  In Braunfeld,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 599\n, we entertained the free-exercise claims of individuals who were attempting to make a profit as retail merchants, and the Court never even hinted that this objective precluded their claims.  As the Court explained in a later case, the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d involves \xe2\x80\x9cnot only belief and profession but the performance of (or abstention from) physical acts\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in for religious reasons.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith, 494\xc2\xa0U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877.  Business practices that are compelled or limited by the tenets of a religious doctrine fall comfortably within that definition.  Thus, a law that \xe2\x80\x9coperates so as to make the practice of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. religious beliefs more expensive\xe2\x80\x9d in the context of business activities imposes a burden on the exercise of religion.  Braunfeld, supra, at 605; see United States v. Lee,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252,\n257 (1982)\n (recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9ccompulsory participation in the social security system interferes with [Amish employers\xe2\x80\x99] free exercise rights\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If, as Braunfeld recognized, a sole proprietorship that seeks to make a profit may assert a free-exercise claim,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a>] why can\xe2\x80\x99t Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel do the same?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Some lower court judges have suggested that RFRA does not protect for-profit corporations because the purpose of such corporations is simply to make money.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">23</a>]  This argument flies in the face of modern corporate law.  \xe2\x80\x9cEach American jurisdiction today either expressly or by implication authorizes corporations to be formed under its general corporation act for any lawful purpose or business.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 J. Cox &amp; T. Hazen, Treatise of the Law of Corporations \xc2\xa74:1, p.\xc2\xa0224 (3d ed. 2010) (emphasis added); see 1A W. Fletcher, Cyclopedia of the Law of Corporations \xc2\xa7102 (rev. ed. 2010).  While it is certainly true that a central objective of for-profit corporations is to make money, modern corporate law does not require for-profit corporations to pursue profit at the expense of everything else, and many do not do so.  For-profit corporations, with ownership approval, support a wide variety of charitable causes, and it is not at all uncommon for such corporations to further humanitarian and other altruistic objectives.  Many examples come readily to mind.  So long as its owners agree, a for-profit corporation may take costly pollution-control and energy-conservation measures that go beyond what the law requires.  A for-profit corporation that operates facilities in other countries may exceed the requirements of local law regarding working conditions and benefits.  If for-profit corporations may pursue such worthy objectives, there is no apparent reason why they may not further religious objectives as well.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS would draw a sharp line between nonprofit corporations (which, HHS concedes, are protected by RFRA) and for-profit corporations (which HHS would leave unprotected), but the actual picture is less clear-cut.  Not all corporations that decline to organize as nonprofits do so in order to maximize profit.  For example, organizations with religious and charitable aims might organize as for-profit corporations because of the potential advantages of that corporate form, such as the freedom to participate in lobbying for legislation or campaigning for political candidates who promote their religious or charitable goals.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">24</a>]  In fact, recognizing the inherent compatibility between establishing a for-profit corporation and pursuing nonprofit goals, States have increasingly adopted laws formally recognizing hybrid corporate forms.  Over half of the States, for instance, now recognize the \xe2\x80\x9cbenefit corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d a dual-purpose entity that seeks to achieve both a benefit for the public and a profit for its owners.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">25</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any event, the objectives that may properly be pursued by the companies in these cases are governed by the laws of the States in which they were incorporated\xe2\x80\x94Pennsylvania and Oklahoma\xe2\x80\x94and the laws of those States permit for-profit corporations to pursue \xe2\x80\x9cany lawful purpose\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cact,\xe2\x80\x9d including the pursuit of profit in conformity with the owners\xe2\x80\x99 religious principles.  15 Pa.

This argument has many flaws.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        First, nothing in the text of RFRA as originally enacted suggested that the statutory phrase \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion under the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d was meant to be tied to this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith interpretation of that Amendment.  When first enacted, RFRA defined the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of religion under the\n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not the exercise of religion as recognized only by then-existing Supreme Court precedents.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (1994 ed.).  When Congress wants to link the meaning of a statutory provision to a body of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law, it knows how to do so.  See, e.g., Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(1) (authorizing habeas relief from a state-court decision that \xe2\x80\x9cwas contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Second, if the original text of RFRA was not clear enough on this point\xe2\x80\x94and we think it was\xe2\x80\x94the amendment of RFRA through RLUIPA surely dispels any doubt.  That amendment deleted the prior reference to the\n \nFirst Amendment, see\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (2000 ed.) (incorporating \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x935), and neither HHS nor the principal dissent can explain why Congress did this if it wanted to tie RFRA coverage tightly to the specific holdings of our pre-Smith free-exercise cases.  Moreover, as discussed, the amendment went further, providing that the exercise of religion \xe2\x80\x9cshall be construed in favor of a broad protection of religious exercise, to the maximum extent permitted by the terms of this chapter and the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(g).  It is simply not possible to read these provisions as restricting the concept of the \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion\xe2\x80\x9d to those practices specifically addressed in our pre-Smith decisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Third, the one pre-Smith case involving the free-exercise rights of a for-profit corporation suggests, if anything, that for-profit corporations possess such rights.  In Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 617 (1961)\n, the Massachusetts Sunday closing law was challenged by a kosher market that was organized as a for-profit corporation, by customers of the market, and by a rabbi.  The Commonwealth argued that the corporation lacked \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d to assert a free-exercise claim,[<a href="#F26" name="T26">26</a>] but not one member of the Court expressed agreement with that argument.  The plurality opinion for four Justices rejected the\n \nFirst Amendment claim on the merits based on the reasoning in Braunfeld, and reserved decision on the question whether the corporation had \xe2\x80\x9cstanding\xe2\x80\x9d to raise the claim.  See 366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 631.  The three dissenters, Justices Douglas, Brennan, and Stewart, found the law unconstitutional as applied to the corporation and the other challengers and thus implicitly recognized their right to assert a free-exercise claim.  See id., at 642 (Brennan, J., joined by Stewart, J., dissenting); McGowan v. Maryland,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420\n\xe2\x80\x93579 (1961) (Douglas, J., dissenting as to related cases including Gallagher).  Fi-nally, Justice Frankfurter\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, which was joined by Justice Harlan, upheld the Massachusetts law on the merits but did not question or reserve decision on the issue of the right of the corporation or any of the other challengers to be heard.  See McGowan, 366 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 521\xe2\x80\x93522.  It is quite a stretch to argue that RFRA, a law enacted to provide very broad protection for religious liberty,left for-profit corporations unprotected simply because in Gallagher\xe2\x80\x94the only pre-Smith case in which the issue was raised\xe2\x80\x94a majority of the Justices did not find it necessary to decide whether the kosher market\xe2\x80\x99s corporate status barred it from raising a free-exercise claim.</p>\n<p style="p-FootnoteText">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, the results would be absurd if RFRA merely restored this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith decisions in ossified form and did not allow a plaintiff to raise a RFRA claim unless that plaintiff fell within a category of plaintiffs one of whom had brought a free-exercise claim that this Court entertained in the years before Smith.  For example, we are not aware of any pre-Smith case in which this Court entertained a free-exercise claim brought by a resident noncitizen.  Are such persons also beyond RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s protective reach simply because the Court never addressed their rights before Smith?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Presumably in recognition of the weakness of this argument, both HHS and the principal dissent fall back on the broader contention that the Nation lacks a tradition of exempting for-profit corporations from generally applicable laws.  By contrast, HHS contends, statutes like Title VII,\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x9319(A), expressly exempt churches and other nonprofit religious institutions but not for-profit corporations.  See Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, p.\xc2\xa026.  In making this argument, however, HHS did not call to our attention the fact that some federal statutes do exempt categories of entities that include for-profit corporations from laws that would otherwise require these entities to engage in activities to which they object on grounds of conscience.  See, e.g., \n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7300a\xe2\x80\x937(b)(2); \xc2\xa7238n(a).[<a href="#F27" name="T27">27</a>]  If Title VII and similar laws show anything, it isthat Congress speaks with specificity when it intends a religious accommodation not to extend to for-profitcorporations.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">4</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Finally, HHS contends that Congress could not have wanted RFRA to apply to for-profit corporations because it is difficult as a practical matter to ascertain the sincere \xe2\x80\x9cbeliefs\xe2\x80\x9d of a corporation.  HHS goes so far as to raise the specter of \xe2\x80\x9cdivisive, polarizing proxy battles over the religious identity of large, publicly traded corporations such as IBM or General Electric.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, at 30.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        These cases, however, do not involve publicly traded corporations, and it seems unlikely that the sort of corporate giants to which HHS refers will often assert RFRA claims.  HHS has not pointed to any example of a publicly traded corporation asserting RFRA rights, and numerous practical restraints would likely prevent that from occurring.  For example, the idea that unrelated shareholders\xe2\x80\x94including institutional investors with their own set of stakeholders\xe2\x80\x94would agree to run a corporation under the same religious beliefs seems improbable.  In any event, we have no occasion in these cases to consider RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s applicability to such companies.  The companies in the cases before us are closely held corporations, each owned and controlled by members of a single family, and no one has disputed the sincerity of their religious beliefs.[<a href="#F28" name="T28">28</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS has also provided no evidence that the purported problem of determining the sincerity of an asserted religious belief moved Congress to exclude for-profit corporations from RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s protection.  On the contrary, the scope of RLUIPA shows that Congress was confident of the ability of the federal courts to weed out insincere claims.  RLUIPA applies to \xe2\x80\x9cinstitutionalized persons,\xe2\x80\x9d a category that consists primarily of prisoners, and by the time of RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, the propensity of some prisoners to assert claims of dubious sincerity was well documented.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">29</a>]  Nevertheless, after our decision in City of Boerne, Congress enacted RLUIPA to preserve the right of prisoners to raise religious liberty claims.  If Congress thought that the federal courts were up to the job of dealing with insincere prisoner claims, there is no reason to believe that Congress limited RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s reach out of concern for the seem-ingly less difficult task of doing the same in corporate cases.  And if, as HHS seems to concede, Congress wanted RFRA to apply to nonprofit corporations, see, Reply Brief in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, what reason is there to think that Congress believed that spotting insincere claims wouldbe tougher in cases involving for-profits?</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS and the principal dissent express concern about the possibility of disputes among the owners of corporations, but that is not a problem that arises because of RFRA or that is unique to this context.  The owners of closely held corporations may\xe2\x80\x94and sometimes do\xe2\x80\x94disagree about the conduct of business.  1 Treatise of the Law of Corporations \xc2\xa714:11.  And even if RFRA did not exist, the owners of a company might well have a dispute relating to religion.  For example, some might want a company\xe2\x80\x99s stores to remain open on the Sabbath in order to make more money, and others might want the stores to close for religious reasons.  State corporate law provides a ready means for resolving any conflicts by, for example, dictating how a corporation can establish its governing structure.  See, e.g., ibid; id., \xc2\xa73:2; Del. Code Ann., Tit. 8, \xc2\xa7351 (2011) (providing that certificate of incorporation may provide how \xe2\x80\x9cthe business of the corporation shall be managed\xe2\x80\x9d).  Courts will turn to that structure and the underlying state law in resolving disputes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For all these reasons, we hold that a federal regulation\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on the activities of a for-profit closely held corporation must comply with RFRA.[<a href="#F30" name="T30">30</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Because RFRA applies in these cases, we must next ask whether the HHS contraceptive mandate \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially burden[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the exercise of religion.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a).  We have little trouble concluding that it does.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As we have noted, the Hahns and Greens have a sincere religious belief that life begins at conception.  They therefore object on religious grounds to providing health insurance that covers methods of birth control that, as HHS acknowledges, see Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 9, n.\xc2\xa04, may result in the destruction of an embryo.  By requiring the Hahns and Greens and their companies to arrange for such coverage, the HHS mandate demands that they engage in conduct that seriously violates their religious beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        If the Hahns and Greens and their companies do not yield to this demand, the economic consequences will be severe.  If the companies continue to offer group health plans that do not cover the contraceptives at issue, they will be taxed $100 per day for each affected individual.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74980D.  For Hobby Lobby, the bill could amount to $1.3 million per day or about $475 million per year; for Conestoga, the assessment could be $90,000 per day or $33 million per year; and for Mardel, it could be $40,000 per day or about $15 million per year.  These sums are surely substantial.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is true that the plaintiffs could avoid these assessments by dropping insurance coverage altogether and thus forcing their employees to obtain health insurance on one of the exchanges established under ACA.  But if at least one of their full-time employees were to qualify for a subsidy on one of the government-run exchanges, this course would also entail substantial economic consequences.  The companies could face penalties of $2,000 per employee each year.  \xc2\xa74980H.  These penalties would amount to roughly $26 million for Hobby Lobby, $1.8 million for Conestoga, and $800,000 for Mardel.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Although these totals are high, amici supporting HHS have suggested that the $2,000 per-employee penalty is actually less than the average cost of providing health insurance, see Brief for Religious Organizations 22, and therefore, they claim, the companies could readily eliminate any substantial burden by forcing their employees to obtain insurance in the government exchanges.  We do not generally entertain arguments that were not raised below and are not advanced in this Court by any party, see United Parcel Service, Inc. v. Mitchell,\n\n451 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56\n, n.\xc2\xa02 (1981); Bell v. Wolfish,\n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520\n, n.\xc2\xa013 (1979); Knetsch v. United States,\n\n364 U.\xc2\xa0S. 361,\n370 (1960)\n, and there are strong reasons to adhere to that practice in these cases.  HHS, which presumably could have compiled the relevant statistics, has never made this argument\xe2\x80\x94not in its voluminous briefing or at oral argument in this Court nor, to our knowledge, in any of the numerous cases in which the issue now before us has been litigated around the country.  As things now stand, we do not even know what the Government\xe2\x80\x99s position might be with respect to these amici\xe2\x80\x99s intensely empirical argument.[<a href="#F31" name="T31">31</a>]  For this same reason, the plaintiffs have never had an opportunity to respond to this novel claim that\xe2\x80\x94contrary to their longstanding practice and that of most large employers\xe2\x80\x94they would be better off discarding their employer insurance plans altogether.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if we were to reach this argument, we would find it unpersuasive.  As an initial matter, it entirely ignores the fact that the Hahns and Greens and their companies have religious reasons for providing health-insurance coverage for their employees.  Before the advent of ACA, they were not legally compelled to provide insurance, but they nevertheless did so\xe2\x80\x94in part, no doubt, for conventional business reasons, but also in part because their religious beliefs govern their relations with their employees.  See App. to Pet. for Cert. in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, p.\xc2\xa011g; App. in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at\xc2\xa0139.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Putting aside the religious dimension of the decision to provide insurance, moreover, it is far from clear that the net cost to the companies of providing insurance is more than the cost of dropping their insurance plans and paying the ACA penalty.  Health insurance is a benefit that employees value.  If the companies simply eliminated that benefit and forced employees to purchase their own insurance on the exchanges, without offering additional compensation, it is predictable that the companies would face a competitive disadvantage in retaining and attracting skilled workers.  See App. in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 153.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The companies could attempt to make up for the elimination of a group health plan by increasing wages, but this would be costly.  Group health insurance is generally less expensive than comparable individual coverage, so the amount of the salary increase needed to fully compensate for the termination of insurance coverage may well exceed the cost to the companies of providing the insurance.  In addition, any salary increase would have to take into account the fact that employees must pay income taxes on wages but not on the value of employer-provided health insurance.\n\n26 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7106(a).  Likewise, employers can deduct the cost of providing health insurance, see \xc2\xa7162(a)(1), but apparently cannot deduct the amount of the penalty that they must pay if insurance is not pro-vided; that difference also must be taken into account.  Given these economic incentives, it is far from clear that it would be financially advantageous for an employer to drop coverage and pay the penalty.[<a href="#F32" name="T32">32</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, we refuse to sustain the challenged regulations on the ground\xe2\x80\x94never maintained by the Government\xe2\x80\x94that dropping insurance coverage eliminates the substantial burden that the HHS mandate imposes.  We doubt that the Congress that enacted RFRA\xe2\x80\x94or, for that matter, ACA\xe2\x80\x94would have believed it a tolerable result to put family-run businesses to the choice of violating their sincerely held religious beliefs or making all of their employees lose their existing healthcare plans.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In taking the position that the HHS mandate does not impose a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, HHS\xe2\x80\x99s main argument (echoed by the principal dissent) is basically that the connection between what the objecting parties must do (provide health-insurance coverage for four methods of contraception that may operate after the fertilization of an egg) and the end that they find to be morally wrong (destruction of an embryo) is simply too attenuated.  Brief for HHS in 13\xe2\x80\x93354, pp. 31\xe2\x80\x9334; post, at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  HHS and the dissent note that providing the coverage would not itself result in the destruction of an embryo; that would occur only if an employee chose to take advantage of the coverage and to use one of the four methods at issue.[<a href="#F33" name="T33">33</a>]  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        This argument dodges the question that RFRA presents (whether the HHS mandate imposes a substantial burden on the ability of the objecting parties to conduct business in accordance with their religious beliefs) and instead addresses a very different question that the federal courts have no business addressing (whether the religious belief asserted in a RFRA case is reasonable).  The Hahns and Greens believe that providing the coverage demanded by the HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage.  This belief implicates a difficult and important question of religion and moral philosophy, namely, the circumstances under which it is wrong for a person to perform an act that is innocent in itself but that has the effect of enabling or facilitating the commission of an immoral act by another.[<a href="#F34" name="T34">34</a>]  Arrogating the authority to provide a binding national answer to this religious and philosophical question, HHS and the principal dissent in effect tell the plaintiffs that their beliefs are flawed.  For good reason, we have repeatedly refused to take such a step.  See, e.g., Smith, 494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 887 (\xe2\x80\x9cRepeatedly and in many different contexts, we have warned that courts must not presume to determine .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the plausibility of a religious claim\xe2\x80\x9d); Hernandez v. Commissioner,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680,\n699 (1989)\n; Presbyterian Church in U.\xc2\xa0S. v. Mary Elizabeth Blue Hull Memorial Presbyterian Church,\n\n393 U.\xc2\xa0S. 440,\n450 (1969)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Moreover, in Thomas v. Review Bd. of Indiana Employment Security Div.,\n\n450 U.\xc2\xa0S. 707 (1981)\n, we considered and rejected an argument that is nearly identical to the one now urged by HHS and the dissent.  In Thomas, a Jehovah\xe2\x80\x99s Witness was initially employed making sheet steel for a variety of industrial uses, but he was later transferred to a job making turrets for tanks.  Id., at 710.  Because he objected on religious grounds to participating in the manufacture of weapons, he lost his job and sought unemployment compensation.  Ruling against the em-ployee, the state court had difficulty with the line thatthe employee drew between work that he found to be con-sistent with his religious beliefs (helping to manufacture steel that was used in making weapons) and work that he found morally objectionable (helping to make the weapons themselves).  This Court, however, held that \xe2\x80\x9cit is not for us to say that the line he drew was an unreasonable one.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 715.[<a href="#F35" name="T35">35</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Similarly, in these cases, the Hahns and Greens and their companies sincerely believe that providing the insurance coverage demanded by the HHS regulations lies on the forbidden side of the line, and it is not for us to say that their religious beliefs are mistaken or insubstantial.  Instead, our \xe2\x80\x9cnarrow function .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in this context is to determine\xe2\x80\x9d whether the line drawn reflects \xe2\x80\x9can honest conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 716, and there is no dispute that it does.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS nevertheless compares these cases to decisions in which we rejected the argument that the use of general tax revenue to subsidize the secular activities of religious institutions violated the Free Exercise Clause.  See Tilton v. Richardson,\n\n403 U.\xc2\xa0S. 672,\n689 (1971)\n (plurality); Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1 v. Allen,\n\n392 U.\xc2\xa0S. 236\n\xe2\x80\x93249 (1968).  But in those cases, while the subsidies were clearly contrary to the challengers\xe2\x80\x99 views on a secular issue, namely, proper church-state relations, the challengers never articulated a religious objection to the subsidies.  As we put it in Tilton, they were \xe2\x80\x9cunable to identify any coercion directed at the practice or exercise of their religious beliefs.\xe2\x80\x9d  403 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 689 (plurality opinion); see Allen, supra, at 249 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]ppellants have not contended that the New York law in any way coerces them as individuals in the practice of their religion\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, in contrast, the plaintiffs do assert that funding the specific contraceptive methods at issue violates their religious beliefs, and HHS does not question their sincerity.  Because the contraceptive mandate forces them to pay an enormous sum of money\xe2\x80\x94as much as $475 million per year in the case of Hobby Lobby\xe2\x80\x94if they insist on providing insurance coverage in accordance with their religious beliefs, the mandate clearly imposes a substantial burden on those beliefs.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Since the HHS contraceptive mandate imposes a substantial burden on the exercise of religion, we must move on and decide whether HHS has shown that the mandate both \xe2\x80\x9c(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS asserts that the contraceptive mandate serves a variety of important interests, but many of these are couched in very broad terms, such as promoting \xe2\x80\x9cpublic health\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgender equality.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 46, 49.  RFRA, however, contemplates a \xe2\x80\x9cmore focused\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry: It \xe2\x80\x9crequires the Government to demonstrate that the compelling interest test is satisfied through application of the challenged law \xe2\x80\x98to the person\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x94the particular claimant whose sincere exercise of religion is being substantially burdened.\xe2\x80\x9d  O\xe2\x80\x99Centro, 546 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 430\xe2\x80\x93431 (quoting \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b)).  This requires us to \xe2\x80\x9cloo[k] beyond broadly formulated interests\xe2\x80\x9d and to \xe2\x80\x9cscrutiniz[e] the asserted harm of granting specific exemptions to particular religious claimants\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94in other words, to look to the marginal interest in enforcing the contraceptive mandate in these cases.  O Centro, supra, at 431.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In addition to asserting these very broadly framed interests, HHS maintains that the mandate serves a compelling interest in ensuring that all women have access to all FDA-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.  See Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315, 49; see Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, at 10, 48.  Under our cases, women (and men) have a constitutional right to obtain contraceptives, see Griswold v. Connecticut,\n\n381 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479\n\xe2\x80\x93486 (1965), and HHS tells us that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]tudies have demonstrated that even moderate copayments for preventive services can deter patients from receiving those services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 50 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The objecting parties contend that HHS has not shown that the mandate serves a compelling government interest, and it is arguable that there are features of ACA that support that view.  As we have noted, many employees\xe2\x80\x94those covered by grandfathered plans and those who work for employers with fewer than 50 employees\xe2\x80\x94may have no contraceptive coverage without cost sharing at all.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS responds that many legal requirements have exceptions and the existence of exceptions does not in itself indicate that the principal interest served by a law is not compelling.  Even a compelling interest may be outweighed in some circumstances by another even weightier consideration.  In these cases, however, the interest served by one of the biggest exceptions, the exception for grandfathered plans, is simply the interest of employers in avoiding the inconvenience of amending an existing plan.  Grandfathered plans are required \xe2\x80\x9cto comply with a subset of the Affordable Care Act\xe2\x80\x99s health reform provisions\xe2\x80\x9d that provide what HHS has described as \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly significant protections.\xe2\x80\x9d  75 Fed. Reg. 34540 (2010).  But the contraceptive mandate is expressly excluded from this subset.  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We find it unnecessary to adjudicate this issue.   We will assume that the interest in guaranteeing cost-free access to the four challenged contraceptive methods is compelling within the meaning of RFRA, and we will proceed to consider the final prong of the RFRA test, i.e., whether HHS has shown that the contraceptive mandate is \xe2\x80\x9cthe least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b)(2).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The least-restrictive-means standard is exceptionally demanding, see City of Boerne, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 532, and it is not satisfied here.  HHS has not shown that it lacks other means of achieving its desired goal without imposing a substantial burden on the exercise of religion by the objecting parties in these cases.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a), (b) (requiring the Government to \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[e] that application of [a substantial] burden to the person .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is the least restrictive means of furthering [a] compelling governmental interest\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The most straightforward way of doing this would be for the Government to assume the cost of providing the four contraceptives at issue to any women who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance policies due to their employers\xe2\x80\x99 religious objections.  This would certainly be less restrictive of the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 religious liberty, and HHS has not shown, see \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b)(2), that this is not a viable alternative.  HHS has not provided any estimate of the average cost per employee of providing access tothese contraceptives, two of which, according to the FDA, are designed primarily for emergency use.  See Birth Control: Medicines to Help You, online at http://www.fda.gov/forconsumers/byaudience/forwomen/freepublications/ucm313215.htm.  Nor has HHS provided any statistics regarding the number of employees who might be affected because they work for corporations like Hobby Lobby, Conestoga, and Mardel.  Nor has HHS told us that it is unable to provide such statistics.  It seems likely, however, that the cost of providing the forms of contraceptives at issue in these cases (if not all FDA-approved contraceptives) would be minor when compared with the overall cost of ACA.  According to one of the Congressional Budget Office\xe2\x80\x99s most recent forecasts, ACA\xe2\x80\x99s insurance-coverage provisions will cost the Federal Government more than $1.3 trillion through the next decade.  See CBO, Updated Estimates of the Effects of the Insurance Coverage Provisions of the Affordable Care Act, April 2014, p. 2.[<a href="#F36" name="T36">36</a>]  If, as HHS tells us, providing all women with cost-free access to all FDA-approved methods of contraception is a Government interest of the highest order, it is hard to understand HHS\xe2\x80\x99s argument that it cannot be required under RFRA to pay anything in order to achieve this important goal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS contends that RFRA does not permit us to take this option into account because \xe2\x80\x9cRFRA cannot be used to require creation of entirely new programs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for HHS in 13\xe2\x80\x93354, at 15.[<a href="#F37" name="T37">37</a>]  But we see nothing in RFRA that supports this argument, and drawing the line between the \xe2\x80\x9ccreation of an entirely new program\xe2\x80\x9d and the modification of an existing program (which RFRA surely allows) would be fraught with problems.  We do not doubt that cost may be an important factor in the least-restrictive-means analysis, but both RFRA and its sister statute, RLUIPA, may in some circumstances require the Government to expend additional funds to accommodate citizens\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs.  Cf. \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x933(c) (RLUIPA: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his chapter may require a government to incur expenses in its own operations to avoid imposing a substantial burden on religious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d).  HHS\xe2\x80\x99s view that RFRA can never require the Government to spend even a small amount reflects a judgment about the importance of religious liberty that was not shared by the Congress that enacted that law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In the end, however, we need not rely on the option of a new, government-funded program in order to conclude that the HHS regulations fail the least-restrictive-means test.  HHS itself has demonstrated that it has at its disposal an approach that is less restrictive than requiring employers to fund contraceptive methods that violate their religious beliefs.  As we explained above, HHS has already established an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious objections.  See supra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and nn.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939.  Under that accommodation, the organization can self-certify that it opposes providing coverage for particular contraceptive services.  See 45 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7147.131(b)(4), (c)(1); 26 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa754.9815\xe2\x80\x932713A(a)(4), (b).  If the organization makes such a certification, the organization\xe2\x80\x99s insurance issuer or third-party administrator must \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xpressly exclude contraceptive coverage from the group health insurance coverage provided in connection with the group health plan\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rovide separate payments for any contraceptive services required to be covered\xe2\x80\x9d without imposing \xe2\x80\x9cany cost-sharing requirements .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the eligible organization, the group health plan, or plan participants or beneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.131(c)(2); 26 CFR \xc2\xa754.9815\xe2\x80\x932713A(c)(2).[<a href="#F38" name="T38">38</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        We do not decide today whether an approach of this type complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.[<a href="#F39" name="T39">39</a>]  At a minimum, however, it does not impinge on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 religious belief that providing insurance coverage for the contraceptives at issue here violates their religion, and it serves HHS\xe2\x80\x99s stated interests equally well.[<a href="#F40" name="T40">40</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The principal dissent identifies no reason why this accommodation would fail to protect the asserted needs of women as effectively as the contraceptive mandate, and there is none.[<a href="#F41" name="T41">41</a>]\xc2\xa0  Under the accommodation, the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 female employees would continue to receive contraceptive coverage without cost sharing for all FDA-approved contraceptives, and they would continue to \xe2\x80\x9cface minimal logistical and administrative obstacles,\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 28 (internal quotation marks omitted), because their employers\xe2\x80\x99 insurers would be responsible for providing information and coverage, see, e.g., 45 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7147.131(c)\xe2\x80\x93(d); cf. 26 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa754.9815\xe2\x80\x932713A(b), (d).  Ironically, it is the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach that would \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mped[e] women\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of benefits by \xe2\x80\x98requiring them to take steps to learn about, and to sign up for, a new government funded and administered health benefit,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d post, at 28, because the dissent would effectively compel religious employers to drop health-insurance coverage altogether, leaving their employees to find individual plans on government-run exchanges or elsewhere.  This is indeed \xe2\x80\x9cscarcely what Congress contemplated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS and the principal dissent argue that a ruling in favor of the objecting parties in these cases will lead to a flood of religious objections regarding a wide variety of medical procedures and drugs, such as vaccinations and blood transfusions, but HHS has made no effort to substantiate this prediction.[<a href="#F42" name="T42">42</a>]  HHS points to no evidence that insurance plans in existence prior to the enactment of ACA excluded coverage for such items.  Nor has HHS provided evidence that any significant number of employers sought exemption, on religious grounds, from any of ACA\xe2\x80\x99s coverage requirements other than the contraceptive mandate.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        It is HHS\xe2\x80\x99s apparent belief that no insurance-coverage mandate would violate RFRA\xe2\x80\x94no matter how significantly it impinges on the religious liberties of employers\xe2\x80\x94that would lead to intolerable consequences.  Under HHS\xe2\x80\x99s view, RFRA would permit the Government to require all employers to provide coverage for any medical procedure allowed by law in the jurisdiction in question\xe2\x80\x94for instance, third-trimester abortions or assisted suicide.  The owners of many closely held corporations could not in good conscience provide such coverage, and thus HHS would effectively exclude these people from full participation in the economic life of the Nation.  RFRA was enacted to prevent such an outcome.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In any event, our decision in these cases is concerned solely with the contraceptive mandate.  Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs.  Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The principal dissent raises the possibility that discrimination in hiring, for example on the basis of race, might be cloaked as religious practice to escape legal sanction.  See post, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333.  Our decision today provides no such shield.  The Government has a compelling interest in providing an equal opportunity to participate in the workforce without regard to race, and prohibitions on racial discrimination are precisely tailored to achieve that critical goal.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        HHS also raises for the first time in this Court the argument that applying the contraceptive mandate to for-profit employers with sincere religious objections is essential to the comprehensive health-insurance scheme that ACA establishes.  HHS analogizes the contraceptive mandate to the requirement to pay Social Security taxes, which we upheld in Lee despite the religious objection of an employer, but these cases are quite different.  Our holding in Lee turned primarily on the special problems associated with a national system of taxation.  We noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he obligation to pay the social security tax initially is not fundamentally different from the obligation to pay income taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 260.  Based on that premise, we explained that it was untenable to allow individuals to seek exemptions from taxes based on religious objections to particular Government expenditures: \xe2\x80\x9cIf, for example, a religious adherent believes war is a sin, and if a certain percentage of the federal budget can be identified as devoted to war-related activities, such individuals would have a similarly valid claim to be exempt from paying that percentage of the income tax.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  We observed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he tax system could not function if denominations were allowed to challenge the tax system because tax payments were spent in a manner that violates their religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see O Centro, 546 U. S., at 435.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Lee was a free-exercise, not a RFRA, case, but if the issue in Lee were analyzed under the RFRA framework, the fundamental point would be that there simply is no less restrictive alternative to the categorical requirement to pay taxes.  Because of the enormous variety of government expenditures funded by tax dollars, allowing tax-payers to withhold a portion of their tax obligations on religious grounds would lead to chaos.  Recognizingexemptions from the contraceptive mandate is very different.  ACA does not create a large national pool of tax revenue for use in purchasing healthcare coverage.  Rather, individual employers like the plaintiffs purchase insurance for their own employees.  And contrary to the principal dissent\xe2\x80\x99s characterization, the employers\xe2\x80\x99 contributions do not necessarily funnel into \xe2\x80\x9cundifferentiated funds.\xe2\x80\x9d  Post, at 23.  The accommodation established by HHS requires issuers to have a mechanism by which to \xe2\x80\x9csegregate premium revenue collected from the eligible organization from the monies used to provide payments for contraceptive services.\xe2\x80\x9d  45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.131(c)(2)(ii).  Recognizing a religious accommodation under RFRA for particular coverage requirements, therefore, does not threaten the viability of ACA\xe2\x80\x99s comprehensive scheme in the way that recognizing religious objections to particular expenditures from general tax revenues would.[<a href="#F43" name="T43">43</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In its final pages, the principal dissent reveals that its fundamental objection to the claims of the plaintiffs is an objection to RFRA itself.  The dissent worries about forcing the federal courts to apply RFRA to a host of claims made by litigants seeking a religious exemption from generally applicable laws, and the dissent expresses a desire to keep the courts out of this business.  See post, at 32\xe2\x80\x9335.  In making this plea, the dissent reiterates a point made forcefully by the Court in Smith.  494 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 888\xe2\x80\x93889 (applying the Sherbert test to all free-exercise claims \xe2\x80\x9cwould open the prospect of constitutionally required religious exemptions from civic obligations of almost every conceivable kind\xe2\x80\x9d).  But Congress, in enacting RFRA, took the position that \xe2\x80\x9cthe compelling interest test as set forth in prior Federal court rulings is a workable test forstriking sensible balances between religious liberty and competing prior governmental interests.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb(a)(5).  The wisdom of Congress\xe2\x80\x99s judgment on this matter is not our concern.

The dissent would evidently glean from that vote an intent by the Senate to prohibit for-profit corporate employers from refusing to offer contraceptive coverage for religious reasons, regardless of whether the contraceptive mandate could pass muster under RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s standards.  But that is not the only plausible inference from the failed amendment\xe2\x80\x94or even the most likely.  For one thing, the text of the amendment was \xe2\x80\x9cwritten so broadly that it would allow any employer to deny any health service to any American for virtually any reason\xe2\x80\x94.\xe2\x80\x9d  158 Cong.

It is thus perfectly reasonable to believe that the amendment was voted down because it extended more broadly than the pre-existing protections of RFRA.

Nothing in the text of RFRA or its basic purposes supports giving the Government an entirely free hand to impose burdens on religious exercise so long as those burdens confer a benefit on other individuals.  It is certainly true that in applying RFRA \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must take adequate account of the burdens a requested accommodation may impose on nonbeneficiaries.\xe2\x80\x9d   v.,\n (applying RLUIPA).  That consideration will often inform the analysis of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest and the availability of a less restrictive means of advancing that interest.  But it could not reasonably be maintained that any burden on religious exercise, no matter how onerous and no matter how readily the government interest could be achieved through alternative means, is permissible under RFRA so long as the relevant legal obligation requires the religious adherent to confer a benefit on third parties.  Otherwise, for example, the Government could decide that all supermarkets must sell alcohol for the convenience of customers (and thereby exclude Muslims with religious objections from owning supermarkets), or it could decide that all restaurants must remain open on Saturdays to give employees an opportunity to earn tips (and thereby exclude Jews with religious objections from owning restaurants).  By framing any Government regulation as benefiting a third party, the Government could turn all regulations into entitlements to which nobody could object on religious grounds, rendering RFRA meaningless.  In any event, our decision in these cases need not result in any detrimental effect on any third party.  As we explain, see , at 43\xe2\x80\x9344, the Government can readily arrange for other methods of providing contraceptives, without cost sharing, to employees who are unable to obtain them under their health-insurance plans due to their employers\xe2\x80\x99 religious objections.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T38" name="F38">38</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0HHS has concluded that insurers that insure eligible employers opting out of the contraceptive mandate and that are required to pay for contraceptive coverage under the accommodation will not experience an increase in costs because the \xe2\x80\x9ccosts of providing contraceptive coverage are balanced by cost savings from lower pregnancy-related costs and from improvements in women\xe2\x80\x99s health.\xe2\x80\x9d  78 Fed.

At the outset it should be said that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does not have the breadth and sweep ascribed to it by the respectful and powerful dissent.  The Court and the dissent disagree on the proper interpretation of the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act of 1993 (RFRA), but do agree on the purpose of that statute.\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb et\xc2\xa0seq.  It is to ensure that interests in religious freedom are protected.  Ante, at 5\xe2\x80\x936; post, at 8\xe2\x80\x939 (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In our constitutional tradition, freedom means that all persons have the right to believe or strive to believe in a divine creator and a divine law.  For those who choose this course, free exercise is essential in preserving their own dignity and in striving for a self-definition shaped by their religious precepts.  Free exercise in this sense implicates more than just freedom of belief.  See Cantwell v. Connecticut,\n\n310 U. S. 296,\n303 (1940)\n.  It means, too, the rightto express those beliefs and to establish one\xe2\x80\x99s religious(or nonreligious) self-definition in the political, civic, and economic life of our larger community.  But in a complex society and an era of pervasive governmental regulation, defining the proper realm for free exercise can be difficult.  In these cases the plaintiffs deem it necessary to exercise their religious beliefs within the context of their own closely held, for-profit corporations.  They claim protection under RFRA, the federal statute discussed with care and in detail in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As the Court notes, under our precedents, RFRA imposes a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stringent test.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6 (quoting City of Boerne v. Flores,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 507,\n533 (1997)\n).  The Government must demonstrate that the application of a substantial burden to a person\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of religion \xe2\x80\x9c(1) is in furtherance of a compelling governmental interest; and (2) is the least restrictive means of furthering that compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(b).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        As to RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s first requirement, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) makes the case that the mandate serves the Government\xe2\x80\x99s compelling interest in providing insurance coverage that is necessary to protect the health of female employees, coverage that is significantly more costly than for a male employee.  Ante, at 39; see, e.g., Brief for HHS in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, pp. 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  There are many medical conditions for which pregnancy is contraindicated.  See, e.g., id., at 47.  It is important to confirm that a premise of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is its assumption that the HHS regulation here at issue furthers a legitimate and compelling interest in the health of female employees.  Ante, at 40.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the Government has not made the second showing required by RFRA, that the means it uses to regulate is the least restrictive way to further its interest.  As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explains, the record in these casesshows that there is an existing, recognized, workable, and already-implemented framework to provide coverage.  That framework is one that HHS has itself devised, that the plaintiffs have not criticized with a specific objection that has been considered in detail by the courts in this litigation, and that is less restrictive than the means challenged by the plaintiffs in these cases.  Ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and n.\xc2\xa09, 43\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The means the Government chose is the imposition of a direct mandate on the employers in these cases.  Ante, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  But in other instances the Government has allowed the same contraception coverage in issue here to be provided to employees of nonprofit religious organizations, as an accommodation to the religious objections of those entities.  See ante, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and n.\xc2\xa09, 43\xe2\x80\x9344.  The accommodation works by requiring insurance companies to cover, without cost sharing, contraception coverage for female employees who wish it.  That accommodation equally furthers the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest but does not impinge on the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 religious beliefs.  See ante, at 44.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        On this record and as explained by the Court, the Government has not met its burden of showing that it cannot accommodate the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 similar religious objections under this established framework.  RFRA is inconsis-tent with the insistence of an agency such as HHS on distinguishing between different religious believers\xe2\x80\x94bur-dening one while accommodating the other\xe2\x80\x94when itmay treat both equally by offering both of them the same accommodation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The parties who were the plaintiffs in the District Courts argue that the Government could pay for the methods that are found objectionable.  Brief for Respondents in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, p. 58.  In discussing this alternative, the Court does not address whether the proper response to a legitimate claim for freedom in the health care arena is for the Government to create an additional program.  Ante, at 41\xe2\x80\x9343.  The Court properly does not resolve whether one freedom should be protected by creating incentives for additional government constraints.  In these cases, it is the Court\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that an accommodation may be made to the employers without imposition of a whole new program or burden on the Government.  As the Court makes clear, this is not a case where it can be established that it is difficult to accommodate the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest, and in fact the mechanism for doing so is already in place.  Ante, at 43\xe2\x80\x9344.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he American community is today, as it long has been, a rich mosaic of religious faiths.\xe2\x80\x9d  Town of Greece v. Galloway, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (Kagan, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 15).  Among the reasons the United States is so open, so tolerant, and so free is that no person may be restricted or demeaned by government in exercising his or her religion.  Yet neither may that same exercise unduly restrict other persons, such as employees, in protecting their own interests, interests the law deems compelling.  In these cases the means to reconcile those two priorities are at hand in the existing accommodation the Government has designed, identified, and used for circumstances closely parallel to those presented here.  RFRA requires the Government to use this less restrictive means.  As the Court explains, this existing model, designed precisely for this problem, might well suffice to distinguish the instant cases from many others in which it is more difficult and expensive to accommodate a governmental program to countless religious claims based on an alleged statutory right of free exercise.

See ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9349.  Compelling governmental interests in uniform compliance with the law, and disadvantages that religion-based opt-outs impose on others, hold no sway, the Court decides, at least when there is a \xe2\x80\x9cless restrictive alternative.\xe2\x80\x9d  And such an alternative, the Court suggests, there always will be whenever, in lieu of tolling an enterprise claiming a religion-based exemption, the government, i.e., the general public, can pick up the tab.

Congress acted on that understanding when, as part of a nationwide insurance program intended to be comprehensive, it called for coverage of preventive care responsive to women\xe2\x80\x99s needs.  Carrying out Congress\xe2\x80\x99 direction, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in consultation with public health experts, promulgated regulations requiring group health plans to cover all forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

In Smith, two members of the Native American Church were dismissed from their jobs and denied unemployment benefits because they ingested peyote at, and as an essential element of, a religious ceremony.

See ante, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03, 7, 17, 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  To support its conception of RFRA as a measure detached from this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, one that sets a new course, the Court points first to the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 (RLUIPA),\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000cc et\xc2\xa0seq., which altered RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cexercise of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d  RFRA, as originally enacted, defined that term to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of religion under the\n \nFirst Amendment to the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (1994 ed.).  See ante, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  As amended by RLUIPA, RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s definition now includes \xe2\x80\x9cany exercise of religion, whether or not compelled by, or central to, a system of religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4) (2012 ed.) (cross-referencing \xc2\xa72000cc\xe2\x80\x935).

RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s alteration clarifies that courts should not question the centrality of a particular religious exercise.  But the amendment in no way suggests that Congress meant to expand the class of entities qualified to mount religious accommodation claims, nor does it relieve courts of the obligation to inquire whether a government action substantially burdens a religious exercise.  See Rasul v. Myers, 563 F.\xc2\xa03d 527, 535 (CADC 2009) (Brown, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt that RLUIPA\xe2\x80\x99s drafters, in changing the definition of \xe2\x80\x98exercise of religion,\xe2\x80\x99 wanted to broaden the scope of the kinds of practices protected by RFRA, not increase the universe of individuals protected by RFRA.\xe2\x80\x9d); H.\xc2\xa0R.

But as RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s statements of purpose and legislative history make clear, Congress intended only to restore, not to scrap or alter, the balancing test as this Court had applied it pre-Smith.  See supra, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.  See also Senate Report 9 (RFRA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest test generally should not be construed more stringently or more leniently than it was prior to Smith.\xe2\x80\x9d); House Report\xc2\xa07 (same).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Congress that passed RFRA correctly read this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith case law as including within the \xe2\x80\x9ccompelling interest test\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  See, e.g., Senate Report 5 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere [a substantial] burden is placed upon the free exercise of religion, the Court ruled [in Sherbert], the Government must demonstrate that it is the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling governmental interest.\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the view that the pre-Smith test included a \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means\xe2\x80\x9d requirement had been aired in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee by experts on religious freedom.  See, e.g., Hearing on S. 2969 before the Senate Committee on the Judiciary, 102d Cong., 2d Sess., 78\xe2\x80\x9379 (1993) (statement of Prof. Douglas Laycock).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Our decision in City of Boerne, it is true, states that the least restrictive means requirement \xe2\x80\x9cwas not used in the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA purported to codify.\xe2\x80\x9d  See ante, at 6, n.\xc2\xa03, 17, n.\xc2\xa018.  As just indicated, however, that statement does not accurately convey the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith jurisprudence.  See Sherbert, 374 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 407 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would plainly be incumbent upon the [government] to demonstrate that no alternative forms of regulation would combat [the problem] without infringing\n \nFirst Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d); Thomas v.

Indeed, by law, no religion-based criterion can restrict the work force of for-profit corporations.  See 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e(b), 2000e\xe2\x80\x931(a), 2000e\xe2\x80\x932(a); cf. Trans World Airlines, Inc. v.

The distinction between a community made up of believers in the same religion and one embracing persons of diverse beliefs, clear as it is, constantly escapes the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>]  One can only wonder why the Court shuts this key difference from sight.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Reading RFRA, as the Court does, to require extension of religion-based exemptions to for-profit corporations surely is not grounded in the pre-Smith precedent Congress sought to preserve.  Had Congress intended RFRA to initiate a change so huge, a clarion statement to that effect likely would have been made in the legislation.  See Whitman v. American Trucking Assns., Inc.,\n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n468 (2001)\n (Congress does not \xe2\x80\x9chide elephants in mouseholes\xe2\x80\x9d).  The text of RFRA makes no such statement and the legislative history does not so much as mention for-profit corporations.  See Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc. v. Sebelius, 723 F.\xc2\xa03d 1114, 1169 (CA10 2013) (Briscoe, C.\xc2\xa0J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (legislative record lacks \xe2\x80\x9cany suggestion that Congress foresaw, let alone intended that, RFRA would cover for-profit corporations\xe2\x80\x9d).  See also Senators Brief 10\xe2\x80\x9313 (none of thecases cited in House or Senate Judiciary Committeereports accompanying RFRA, or mentioned during floor speeches, recognized the free exercise rights of for-profit corporations).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court notes that for-profit corporations may support charitable causes and use their funds for religious ends, and therefore questions the distinction between such corporations and religious nonprofit organizations.  See ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9325.  See also ante, at 3 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (criticizing the Government for \xe2\x80\x9cdistinguishing between different religious believers\xe2\x80\x94burdening one while accommodating the other\xe2\x80\x94when it may treat both equally by offering both of them the same accommodation\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]  Again, the Court forgets that religious organizations exist to serve a community of believers.  For-profit corporations do not fit that bill.  Moreover, history is not on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s side.  Recognition of the discrete characters of \xe2\x80\x9cecclesiastical and lay\xe2\x80\x9d corporations dates back to Blackstone, see 1 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 458 (1765), and was reiterated by this Court centuries before the enactment of the Internal Revenue Code.  See Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49 (1815) (describing religious corporations); Trustees of Dartmouth College, 4 Wheat., at 645 (discussing \xe2\x80\x9celeemosynary\xe2\x80\x9d corporations, including those \xe2\x80\x9ccreated for the promotion of religion\xe2\x80\x9d).  To reiterate, \xe2\x80\x9cfor-profit corporations are different from religious non-profits in that they use labor to make a profit, rather than to perpetuate [the] religious value[s] [shared by a community of believers].\xe2\x80\x9d  Gilardi, 733 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1242 (Edwards, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Citing Braunfeld v.

See also ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But even accepting, arguendo, the premise that unincorporated business enterprises may gain religious accommodations under the Free Exercise Clause, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion is unsound.  In a sole proprietorship, the business and its owner are one and the same.  By incorporating a business, however, an individual separates herself from the entity and escapes personal responsibility for the entity\xe2\x80\x99s obligations.  One might ask why the separation should hold only when it serves the interest of those who control the corporation.  In any event, Braunfeld is hardly impressive authority for the entitlement Hobby Lobby and Conestoga seek.  The free exercise claim asserted there was promptly rejected on the merits.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination that RFRA extends to for-profit corporations is bound to have untoward effects.  Although the Court attempts to cabin its language to closely held corporations, its logic extends to corporations of any size, public or private.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]  Little doubt that RFRA claims will proliferate, for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s expansive notion of corporate personhood\xe2\x80\x94combined with its other errorsin construing RFRA\xe2\x80\x94invites for-profit entities to seek religion-based exemptions from regulations they deem offensive to their faith.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if Hobby Lobby and Conestoga were deemed RFRA \xe2\x80\x9cperson[s],\xe2\x80\x9d to gain an exemption, they must demonstrate that the contraceptive coverage requirement \xe2\x80\x9csubstan-tially burden[s] [their] exercise of religion.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a).  Congress no doubt meant the modifier \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially\xe2\x80\x9d to carry weight.  In the original draft of RFRA, the word \xe2\x80\x9cburden\xe2\x80\x9d appeared unmodified.  The word \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially\xe2\x80\x9d was inserted pursuant to a clarifying amendment offered by Senators Kennedy and Hatch.  See 139 Cong. Rec. 26180.  In proposing the amendment, Senator Kennedy stated that RFRA, in accord with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-Smith case law, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not require the Government to justify every action that has some effect on religious exercise.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        The Court barely pauses to inquire whether any burden imposed by the contraceptive coverage requirement is substantial.  Instead, it rests on the Greens\xe2\x80\x99 and Hahns\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cbelie[f\xc2\xa0] that providing the coverage demanded by the HHS regulations is connected to the destruction of an embryo in a way that is sufficient to make it immoral for them to provide the coverage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 36.[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>]  I agree with the Court that the Green and Hahn families\xe2\x80\x99 religious convictions regarding contraception are sincerely held.  See Thomas, 450 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 715 (courts are not to question where an individual \xe2\x80\x9cdr[aws] the line\xe2\x80\x9d in defining which practices run afoul of her religious beliefs).  See also 42 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000bb\xe2\x80\x931(a), 2000bb\xe2\x80\x932(4), 2000cc\xe2\x80\x935(7)(A).[<a href="#F21" name="T21">21</a>]  But those beliefs, however deeply held, do not suffice to sustain a RFRA claim.  RFRA, properly understood, distinguishes between \xe2\x80\x9cfactual allegations that [plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] beliefs are sincere and of a religious nature,\xe2\x80\x9d which a court must accept as true, and the \xe2\x80\x9clegal conclusion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that [plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99] religious exercise is substantially burdened,\xe2\x80\x9d an inquiry the court must undertake.  Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.\xc2\xa03d 669, 679 (CADC 2008).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That distinction is a facet of the pre-Smith jurisprudence RFRA incorporates.  Bowen v. Roy,\n\n476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 693 (1986)\n, is instructive.  There, the Court rejected a free exercise challenge to the Government\xe2\x80\x99s use of a Native American child\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security number for purposes of administering benefit programs.  Without questioning the sincerity of the father\xe2\x80\x99s religious belief that \xe2\x80\x9cuse of [his daughter\xe2\x80\x99s Social Security] number may harm [her] spirit,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court concluded that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s internaluses of that number \xe2\x80\x9cplace[d] [no] restriction on what [the father] may believe or what he may do.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 699.  Recognizing that the father\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creligious views may not accept\xe2\x80\x9d the position that the challenged uses concerned only the Government\xe2\x80\x99s internal affairs, the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9cfor the adjudication of a constitutional claim, the Constitution, rather than an individual\xe2\x80\x99s religion, must supply the frame of reference.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 700\xe2\x80\x93701, n.\xc2\xa06.  See also Hernandez v. Commissioner,\n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 680,\n699 (1989)\n (distinguishing between, on the one hand, \xe2\x80\x9cquestion[s] [of] the centrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of particular litigants\xe2\x80\x99 interpretations of those creeds,\xe2\x80\x9d and, on the other, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the alleged burden imposed [by the challenged government action] is a substantial one\xe2\x80\x9d).  Inattentive to this guidance, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision elides entirely the distinction between the sincerity of a challenger\xe2\x80\x99s religious belief and the substantiality of the burden placed on the challenger.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Undertaking the inquiry that the Court forgoes, I would conclude that the connection between the families\xe2\x80\x99 religious objections and the contraceptive coverage requirement is too attenuated to rank as substantial.  The requirement carries no command that Hobby Lobby or Conestoga purchase or provide the contraceptives they find objectionable.  Instead, it calls on the companies covered by the requirement to direct money into undifferentiated funds that finance a wide variety of benefits under comprehensive health plans.  Those plans, in order to comply with the ACA, see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x936, must offer contraceptive coverage without cost sharing, just as they must cover an array of other preventive services.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Importantly, the decisions whether to claim benefits under the plans are made not by Hobby Lobby or Cones-toga, but by the covered employees and dependents, in consultation with their health care providers.  Should an employee of Hobby Lobby or Conestoga share the religious beliefs of the Greens and Hahns, she is of course under no compulsion to use the contraceptives in question.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o individual decision by an employee and her physician\xe2\x80\x94be it to use contraception, treat an infection, or have a hip replaced\xe2\x80\x94is in any meaningful sense [her employer\xe2\x80\x99s] decision or action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Grote v. Sebelius, 708 F.\xc2\xa03d 850, 865 (CA7 2013) (Rovner, J., dissenting).  It is doubtful that Congress, when it specified that burdens must be \xe2\x80\x9csubstantia[l],\xe2\x80\x9d had in mind a linkage thus interrupted by independent decisionmakers (the woman and her health counselor) standing between the challenged government action and the religious exercise claimed to be infringed.  Any decision to use contraceptives made by a woman covered under Hobby Lobby\xe2\x80\x99s or Conestoga\xe2\x80\x99s plan will not be propelled by the Government, it will be the wo-man\xe2\x80\x99s autonomous choice, informed by the physician she consults.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">3</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Even if one were to conclude that Hobby Lobby and Conestoga meet the substantial burden requirement, the Government has shown that the contraceptive coverage for which the ACA provides furthers compelling interests in public health and women\xe2\x80\x99s well being.  Those interests are concrete, specific, and demonstrated by a wealth of empirical evidence.  To recapitulate, the mandated contraception coverage enables women to avoid the health problems unintended pregnancies may visit on them and their children.  See IOM Report 102\xe2\x80\x93107.  The coverage helps safeguard the health of women for whom pregnancy may be hazardous, even life threatening.  See Brief for American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  And the mandate secures benefits wholly unrelated to pregnancy, preventing certain cancers, menstrual disorders, and pelvic pain.

Reg. 39872 (2013); IOM Report 107.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        That Hobby Lobby and Conestoga resist coverage for only 4 of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives does not lessen these compelling interests.  Notably, the corporations exclude intrauterine devices (IUDs), devices significantly more effective, and significantly more expensive than other contraceptive methods.  See id., at 105.[<a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a>]  Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning appears to permit commercial enterprises like Hobby Lobby and Conestoga to exclude from their group health plans all forms of contraceptives.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 38\xe2\x80\x9339 (counsel for Hobby Lobby acknowledged that his \xe2\x80\x9cargument .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would apply just as well if the employer said \xe2\x80\x98no contraceptives\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Perhaps the gravity of the interests at stake has led the Court to assume, for purposes of its RFRA analysis, that the compelling interest criterion is met in these cases.  See ante, at 40.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">23</a>]  It bears note in this regard that the cost of an IUD is nearly equivalent to a month\xe2\x80\x99s full-time pay for workers earning the minimum wage, Brief for Guttmacher Institute et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 16; that almost one-third of women would change their contraceptive method if costs were not a factor, Frost &amp; Darroch, Factors Associated With Contraceptive Choice and Inconsistent Method Use, United States, 2004, 40 Perspectives on Sexual &amp; Reproductive Health 94, 98 (2008); and that only one-fourth of women who request an IUD actually have one inserted after finding out how expensive it would be, Gariepy, Simon, Patel, Creinin, &amp; Schwarz, The Impact of Out-of-Pocket Expense on IUD Utilization Among Women With Private Insurance, 84 Contraception e39, e40 (2011).  See also Eisenberg, supra, at S60 (recent study found that women who face out-of-pocket IUD costs in excess of $50 were \xe2\x80\x9c11-times less likely to obtain an IUD than women who had to pay less than $50\xe2\x80\x9d); Postlethwaite, Trussell, Zoolakis, Shabear, &amp; Petitti, A Comparison of Contraceptive Procurement Pre- and Post-Benefit Change, 76 Contraception 360, 361\xe2\x80\x93362 (2007) (when one health system eliminated patient cost sharing for IUDs, use of this form of contraception more than doubled).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Stepping back from its assumption that compelling interests support the contraceptive coverage requirement, the Court notes that small employers and grandfathered plans are not subject to the requirement.  If there is a compelling interest in contraceptive coverage, the Court suggests, Congress would not have created these exclusions.  See ante, at 39\xe2\x80\x9340.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Federal statutes often include exemptions for small employers, and such provisions have never been held to undermine the interests served by these statutes.  See, e.g., Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993,\n\n29 U. S. C. \xc2\xa72611(4)(A)(i) (applicable to employers with 50 or more employees); Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967,\n\n29 U. S.

Once specified changes are made, grandfathered status ceases.  See 45 CFR \xc2\xa7147.140(g).  Hobby Lobby\xe2\x80\x99s own situation is illustrative.  By the time this litigation commenced, Hobby Lobby did not have grandfathered status.  Asked why by the District Court, Hobby Lobby\xe2\x80\x99s counsel explained that the \xe2\x80\x9cgrandfathering requirements mean that you can\xe2\x80\x99t make a whole menu of changes to your plan that involve things like the amount of co-pays, the amount of co-insurance, deductibles, that sort of thing.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93354, pp. 39\xe2\x80\x9340.

A \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means\xe2\x80\x9d cannot require employees to relinquish benefits accorded them by federal law in order to ensure that their commercial employers can adhere unreservedly to their religious tenets.

Does it rank as a less restrictive alternative to require the government to provide the money or benefit to which the employer hasa religion-based objection?[<a href="#F26" name="T26">26</a>]  Because the Court cannot easily answer that question, it proposes something else: Extension to commercial enterprises of the accommodation already afforded to nonprofit religion-based organizations.  See ante, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 9\xe2\x80\x9310, 43\xe2\x80\x9345.  \xe2\x80\x9cAt a minimum,\xe2\x80\x9d according to the Court, such an approach would not \xe2\x80\x9cimpinge on [Hobby Lobby\xe2\x80\x99s and Conestoga\xe2\x80\x99s] religious belief.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 44.  I have already discussed the \xe2\x80\x9cspecial solicitude\xe2\x80\x9d generally accorded nonprofit religion-based organizations that exist to serve a community of believers, solicitude never before accorded to commercial enterprises comprising employees of diverse faiths.  See supra, at 14\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Ultimately, the Court hedges on its proposal to align for-profit enterprises with nonprofit religion-based organizations.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not decide today whether [the] approach [the opinion advances] complies with RFRA for purposes of all religious claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 44.  Counsel for Hobby Lobby was similarly noncommittal.  Asked at oral argument whether the Court-proposed alternative was acceptable,[<a href="#F27" name="T27">27</a>] counsel responded: \xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t been offered that accommodation, so we haven\xe2\x80\x99t had to decide what kind of objection, if any, we would make to that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 86\xe2\x80\x9387.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Conestoga suggests that, if its employees had to acquire and pay for the contraceptives (to which the corporation objects) on their own, a tax credit would qualify as a less restrictive alternative.  See Brief for Petitioners in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, p. 64.  A tax credit, of course, is one variety of \xe2\x80\x9clet the government pay.\xe2\x80\x9d  In addition to departing from the existing employer-based system of health insurance, Conestoga\xe2\x80\x99s alternative would require a woman to reach into her own pocket in the first instance, and it would do nothing for the woman too poor to be aided by a tax credit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        In sum, in view of what Congress sought to accomplish, i.e., comprehensive preventive care for women furnished through employer-based health plans, none of the proffered alternatives would satisfactorily serve the compelling interests to which Congress responded.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Among the pathmarking pre-Smith decisions RFRA preserved is United States v. Lee,\n\n455 U.\xc2\xa0S. 252 (1982)\n.  Lee, a sole proprietor engaged in farming and carpentry, was a member of the Old Order Amish.  He sincerely believed that withholding Social Security taxes from his employees or paying the employer\xe2\x80\x99s share of such taxes would violate the Amish faith.  This Court held that, although the obligations imposed by the Social Security system conflicted with Lee\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs, the burden was not unconstitutional.  Id., at 260\xe2\x80\x93261.  See also id., at 258 (recognizing the important governmental interest in providing a \xe2\x80\x9cnationwide .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. comprehensive insurance system with a variety of benefits available to all participants, with costs shared by employers and employees\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F28" name="T28">28</a>]  The Government urges that Lee should control the challenges brought by Hobby Lobby and Conestoga.  See Brief for Respondents in No. 13\xe2\x80\x93356, p.\xc2\xa018.  In contrast, today\xe2\x80\x99s Court dismisses Lee as a tax case.  See ante, at 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  Indeed, it was a tax case and the Court in Lee homed in on \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he difficulty in attempting to accommodate religious beliefs in the area of taxation.\xe2\x80\x9d  455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 259.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        But the Lee Court made two key points one cannot confine to tax cases.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen followers of a particular sect enter into commercial activity as a matter of choice,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthe limits they accept on their own conduct as a matter of conscience and faith are not to be superimposed on statutory schemes which are binding on others in that activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 261.  The statutory scheme of employer-based comprehensive health coverage involved in these cases is surely binding on others engaged in the same trade or business as the corporate challengers here, Hobby Lobby and Conestoga.  Further, the Court recognized in Lee that allowing a religion-based exemption to a commercial employer would \xe2\x80\x9coperat[e] to impose the employer\xe2\x80\x99s religious faith on the employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.[<a href="#F29" name="T29">29</a>]  No doubt the Greens and Hahns and all who share their beliefs may decline to acquire for themselves the contraceptives in question.  But that choice may not be imposed on employees who hold other beliefs.  Working for Hobby Lobby or Conestoga, in other words, should not deprive employees of the preventive care available to workers at the shop next door,[<a href="#F30" name="T30">30</a>] at least in the absence of directions from the Legislature or Administration to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Why should decisions of this order be made by Congress or the regulatory authority, and not this Court?  Hobby Lobby and Conestoga surely do not stand alone as commercial enterprises seeking exemptions from generally applicable laws on the basis of their religious beliefs.  See, e.g., Newman v. Piggie Park Enterprises, Inc., 256 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 941, 945 (SC 1966) (owner of restaurant chain refused to serve black patrons based on his religious beliefs opposing racial integration), aff\xe2\x80\x99d in relevant part and rev\xe2\x80\x99d in part on other grounds, 377 F.\xc2\xa02d 433 (CA4 1967), aff\xe2\x80\x99d and modified on other grounds,\n\n390 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400 (1968)\n; In re Minnesota ex rel.

Would RFRA require exemptions in cases of this ilk?  And if not, how does the Court divine which religious beliefs are worthy of accommodation, and which are not?  Isn\xe2\x80\x99t the Court disarmed from making such a judgment given its recognition that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts must not presume to determine .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the plausibility of a religious claim\xe2\x80\x9d?  Ante, at 37.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        Would the exemption the Court holds RFRA demands for employers with religiously grounded objections to the use of certain contraceptives extend to employers with religiously grounded objections to blood transfusions (Jehovah\xe2\x80\x99s Witnesses); antidepressants (Scientologists); medications derived from pigs, including anesthesia, intravenous fluids, and pills coated with gelatin (certain Muslims, Jews, and Hindus); and vaccinations (Christian Scientists, among others)?[<a href="#F31" name="T31">31</a>]  According to counsel for Hobby Lobby, \xe2\x80\x9ceach one of these cases .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would have to be evaluated on its own .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. apply[ing] the compelling interest-least restrictive alternative test.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. of Oral Arg. 6.

Today\xe2\x80\x99s cases, the Court concludes, are \xe2\x80\x9cconcerned solely with the contraceptive mandate.  Our decision should not be understood to hold that an insurance-coverage mandate must necessarily fall if it conflicts with an employer\xe2\x80\x99s religious beliefs.  Other coverage requirements, such as immunizations, may be supported by different interests (for example, the need to combat the spread of infectious diseases) and may involve different arguments about the least restrictive means of providing them.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 46.  But the Court has assumed, for RFRA purposes, that the interest in women\xe2\x80\x99s health and well being is compelling and has come up with no means adequate to serve that interest, the one motivating Congress to adopt the Women\xe2\x80\x99s Health Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        There is an overriding interest, I believe, in keeping the courts \xe2\x80\x9cout of the business of evaluating the relative merits of differing religious claims,\xe2\x80\x9d Lee, 455 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 263, n.\xc2\xa02 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment), or the sincerity with which an asserted religious belief is held.  Indeed, approving some religious claims while deeming others unworthy of accommodation could be \xe2\x80\x9cperceived as favoring one religion over another,\xe2\x80\x9d the very \xe2\x80\x9crisk the Establishment Clause was designed to preclude.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The Court, I fear, has ventured into a minefield, cf. Spencer v. World Vision, Inc., 633 F.\xc2\xa03d 723, 730 (CA9 2010) (O\xe2\x80\x99Scannlain, J., concurring), by its immoderate reading of RFRA.  I would confine religious exemptions under that Act to organizations formed \xe2\x80\x9cfor a religious purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cengage[d] primarily in carrying out that religious purpose,\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cengaged .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. substantially in the exchange of goods or services for money beyond nominal amounts.\xe2\x80\x9d  See id., at 748 (Kleinfeld, J., concurring).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n        \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n        For the reasons stated, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit and affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court insists it has held none of these things, for another less restrictive alternative is at hand: extending an existing accommodation, currently limited to religious nonprofit organizations, to encompass commercial enterprises.

With that accommodation extended, the Court asserts, \xe2\x80\x9cwomen would still be entitled to all [Food and Drug Administration]-approved contraceptives without cost sharing.\xe2\x80\x9d  at 4.  In the end, however, the Court is not so sure.
