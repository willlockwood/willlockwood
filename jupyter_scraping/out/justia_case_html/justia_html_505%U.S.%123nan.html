In 1912, in one month, its entire African-American population, over 1,000 citizens, was driven systematically from the county in the wake of the rape and murder of a white woman and the lynching of her accused assailant.1 Seventy-five years later, in 1987, the county population remained 99% white.2</p><p>Spurred by this history, Hosea Williams, an Atlanta city councilman and civil rights personality, proposed a Forsyth County "March Against Fear and Intimidation" for J anuary 17, 1987. Approximately 90 civil rights demonstrators attempted to parade in Cumming, the county seat. The marchers were met by members of the Forsyth County Defense League (an independent affiliate of respondent, The Nationalist Movement), of the Ku Klux Klan, and other Cumming residents. In all, some 400 counterdemonstrators lined the parade route, shouting racial slurs. Eventually, the counterdemonstrators, dramatically outnumbering police officers, forced the parade to a premature halt by throwing rocks and beer bottles.</p><p>Williams planned a return march the following weekend.</p><p>It developed into the largest civil rights demonstration in the South since the 1960\'s. On January 24, approximately 20,000 marchers joined civil rights leaders, United States Senators, Presidential candidates, and an Assistant United States Attorney General in a parade and rally.3 The 1,000 counterdemonstrators on the parade route were contained</p><p>1 The 1910 census counted 1,098 African-Americans in Forsyth County.</p><p>U.

Although there was sporadic rock throwing and 60 counterdemonstrators were arrested, the parade was not interrupted. The demonstration cost over $670,000 in police protection, of which Forsyth County apparently paid a small portion.4 See App. to Pet. for Cert. 75-94; Los Angeles Times, Jan. 28, 1987, Metro section, p. 5, col. 1.</p><p>"As a direct result" of these two demonstrations, the Forsyth County Board of Commissioners enacted Ordinance 34 on January 27, 1987. See Brief for Petitioner 6. The ordinance recites that it is "to provide for the issuance of permits for parades, assemblies, demonstrations, road closings, and other uses of public property and roads by private organizations and groups of private persons for private purposes." See App. to Pet. for Cert. 98. The board of commissioners justified the ordinance by explaining that "the cost of necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in or observing said parades, assemblies, demonstrations, road closings and other related activities exceeds the usual and normal cost of law enforcement for which those participating should be held accountable and responsible." <i>Id., </i>at 100. The ordinance required the permit applicant to defray these costs by paying a fee, the amount of which was to be fixed "from time to time" by the Board. <i>Id., </i>at 105.</p><p>Ordinance 34 was amended on June 8, 1987, to provide that every permit applicant "\'shall pay in advance for such permit, for the use of the County, a sum not more than $1,000.00 for each day such parade, procession, or open air public meeting shall take place.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 119.5 In addition, the county</p><p>4 Petitioner Forsyth County does not indicate what portion of these costs it paid. Newspaper articles reported that the State of Georgia paid an estimated $579,148. Other government entities paid an additional $29,759. Figures were not available for the portion paid by the city of Atlanta for the police it sent. See <i>id., </i>at 95-97.</p><p>5 The ordinance was amended at other times, too, but those amendments are not under challenge here.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="127">127</a></p><p>administrator was empowered to "\'adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed.\'" <i>Ibid.</i></p><p>In January 1989, respondent The Nationalist Movement proposed to demonstrate in opposition to the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of Martin Luther King, Jr. In Forsyth County, the Movement sought to "conduct a rally and speeches for one and a half to two hours" on the courthouse steps on a Saturday afternoon. <i>Nationalist Movement </i>v. <i>City of Cumming, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/913/885/">913 F.2d 885</a>, 887 (CAll 1990).6 The county imposed a $100 fee. The fee did not include any calculation for expenses incurred by law enforcement authorities, but was based on 10 hours of the county administrator\'s time in issuing the permit. The county administrator testified that the cost of his time was deliberately undervalued and that he did not charge for the clerical support involved in processing the application. Tr. 135-139.</p><p>The Movement did not pay the fee and did not hold the rally. Instead, it instituted this action on January 19, 1989, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, requesting a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction prohibiting Forsyth County from interfering with the Movement\'s plans.</p><p>The District Court denied the temporary restraining order and injunction. It found that, although "the instant ordinance vests much discretion in the County Administrator in determining an appropriate fee," the determination of the fee was "based solely upon content-neutral criteria; namely,</p><p>6 The demonstration proposed was to consist of assembling at the Forsyth County High School, marching down a public street in Cumming to the courthouse square, and there conducting a rally. Only the rally was to take place on property under the jurisdiction of the county. The parade and assembly required permits from the city of Cumming and the Forsyth County Board of Education. Their permit schemes are not challenged here.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="128">128</a></p><p>the actual costs incurred investigating and processing the application." App. to Pet. for Cert. 13-14. Although it expressed doubt about the constitutionality of that portion of the ordinance that permits fees to be based upon the costs incident to maintaining public order, the District Court found that "the county ordinance, as applied in this case, is not unconstitutional." <i>Id., </i>at 14.</p><p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed this aspect of the District Court\'s judgment. <i>Nationalist Movement </i>v. <i>City of Cumming, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/913/885/">913 F.2d 885</a> (1990). Relying on its prior opinion in <i>Central Florida Nuclear Freeze Campaign </i>v. <i>Walsh, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/774/1515/">774 F.2d 1515</a>, 1521 (CAll 1985), cert. denied, 475 U. S. 1120 (1986), the Court of Appeals held: "An ordinance which charges more than a nominal fee for using public forums for public issue speech, violates the First Amendment." 913 F. 2d, at 891 (internal quotation marks omitted). The court determined that a permit fee of up to $1,000 a day exceeded this constitutional threshold. <i>Ibid. </i>One judge concurred specially, calling for <i>Central Florida </i>to be overruled. 913 F. 2d, at 896.</p><p>The Court of Appeals then voted to vacate the panel\'s opinion and to rehear the case en bane. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/921/1125/">921 F.2d 1125</a> (1990). After further briefing, the court issued a <i>per curiam </i>opinion reinstating the panel opinion in its entirety. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/934/1482/">934 F.2d 1482</a>, 1483 (1991). Two judges, concurring in part and dissenting in part, agreed that any fee imposed on the exercise of First Amendment rights in a traditional public forum must be nominal if it is to survive constitutional scrutiny.

S. 1023 (1991).</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Respondent mounts a facial challenge to the Forsyth County ordinance. It is well established that in the area of freedom of expression an overbroad regulation may be subject to facial review and invalidation, even though its application in the case under consideration may be constitutionally unobjectionable. See, <i>e. g., City Council of Los Angeles </i>v. <i>Taxpayers for Vincent, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/789/case.html">466 U. S. 789</a>, 798-799, and n. 15 <i>(1984); Board of Airport Comm\'rs of Los Angeles </i>v. <i>Jews for Jesus, Inc., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/569/case.html">482 U. S. 569</a>, 574 (1987). This exception from general standing rules is based on an appreciation that the very existence of some broadly written laws has the potential to chill the expressive activity of others not before the court. See, <i>e. g., New York </i>v. <i>Ferber, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U.

In the present litigation, the county has made clear how it interprets and implements the ordinance. The ordinance can apply to any activity on public propertyfrom parades, to street corner speeches, to bike races-and the fee assessed may reflect the county\'s police and administrative costs. Whether or not, in any given instance, the fee would include any or all of the county\'s administrative and security expenses is decided by the county administrator.9</p><p>9 In pertinent part, the ordinance, as amended, states that the administrator <i>"shall </i>adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance of public order." \xc2\xa7 3(6) (emphasis added), App. to Pet. for Cert. 119. This could suggest that the administrator has no authority to reduce or waive these expenses. It has not been so understood, however, by the county. See 934 F. 2d, at 1488, n. 12 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part). In its February 23, 1987, amendments to the ordinance, the board of commissioners changed the permit form from "Have you paid <i>the </i>application fee?" to "Have you paid <i>any </i>application fee?," see App. to</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="132">132</a></p><p>In this case, according to testimony at the District Court hearing, the administrator based the fee on his own judgment of what would be reasonable. Although the county paid for clerical support and staff as an "expense incident to the administration" of the permit, the administrator testified that he chose in this instance not to include that expense in the fee. The administrator also attested that he had deliberately kept the fee low by undervaluing the cost of the time he spent processing the application. Even if he had spent more time on the project, he claimed, he would not have charged more. He further testified that, in this instance, he chose not to include any charge for expected security expense. Tr. 135-139.</p><p>The administrator also explained that the county had imposed a fee pursuant to a permit on two prior occasions. The year before, the administrator had assessed a fee of $100 for a permit for the Movement. The administrator testified that he charged the same fee the following year (the year in question here), although he did not state that the Movement was seeking the same use of county property or that it required the same amount of administrative time to process. <i>Id., </i>at 138. The administrator also once charged bike-race organizers $25 to hold a race on county roads, but he did not explain why processing a bike-race permit demanded less administrative time than processing a parade permit or why he had chosen to assess $25 in that instance. <i>Id., </i>at 143-144. At oral argument in this Court, counsel for Forsyth County stated that the administrator had levied a $5 fee on the Girl Scouts for an activity on county property. Tr. of Oral Arg. 26.

The decision how much to charge for police protection or administrative time-or even whether to charge at all-is left to the whim of the administrator. There are no articulated standards either in the ordinance or in the county\'s established practice. The administrator is not required to rely on any objective factors. He need not provide any explanation for his decision, and that decision is unreviewable. Nothing in the law or its application prevents the official from encouraging some views and discouraging others through the arbitrary application of fees.10 The First Amendment prohibits the vesting of such unbridled discretion in a government official.ll</p><p align="center">\nB</p><p>The Forsyth County ordinance contains more than the possibility of censorship through uncontrolled discretion. As</p><p>10 The District Court\'s finding that in this instance the Forsyth County administrator applied legitimate, content-neutral criteria, even if correct, is irrelevant to this facial challenge.

See <i>post, </i>at 142. We disagree. A remand is unnecessary because there is no question that petitioner intends the ordinance to recoup costs that are related to listeners\' reaction to the speech. Petitioner readily admits it did not charge for police protection for the 4th of July parades, although they were substantial parades, which required the closing of streets and drew large crowds. Petitioner imposed a fee only when it became necessary to provide security for parade participants from angry crowds opposing their message. Brief for Petitioner 6. The ordinance itself makes plain that the costs at issue are those needed for "necessary and reasonable protection of persons participating in or observing" the speech.

S. 569</a> (1941). Although the Supreme Court of New Hampshire had interpreted the statute at issue in <i>Cox </i>to authorize the municipality to charge a permit fee for the "maintenance of public order," no fee was actually assessed. See <i>id., </i>at 577. Nothing in this Court\'s opinion suggests that the statute, as interpreted by the New Hampshire Supreme Court, called for charging a premium in the case of a controversial political message delivered before a hostile audience. In light of the Court\'s subsequent First Amendment jurisprudence, we do not read <i>Cox </i>to permit such a premium.</p><p align="center">\nC</p><p>Petitioner, as well as the Court of Appeals and the District Court, all rely on the maximum allowable fee as the touchstone of constitutionality. Petitioner contends that the $1,000 cap on the fee ensures that the ordinance will not result in content-based discrimination. The ordinance was found unconstitutional by the Court of Appeals because the $1,000 cap was not sufficiently low to be "nominal." Neither the $1,000 cap on the fee charged, nor even some lower nominal cap, could save the ordinance because in this context, the level of the fee is irrelevant. A tax based on the content of speech does not become more constitutional because it is a small tax.</p><p>The lower courts derived their requirement that the permit fee be "nominal" from a sentence in the opinion in <i>Murdock </i>v. <i>Pennsylvania, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/105/case.html">319 U. S. 105</a> (1943). In <i>Murdock, </i>the Court invalidated a fiat license fee levied on distributors of religious literature. In distinguishing the case from <i>Cox,</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="137">137</a></p><p>where the Court upheld a permit fee, the Court stated: "And the fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measure and calculated to defray the expense of protecting those on the streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors." 319 U. S., at 116. This sentence does not mean that an invalid fee can be saved if it is nominal, or that only nominal charges are constitutionally permissible. It reflects merely one distinction between the facts in <i>Murdock </i>and those in <i>Cox.</i></p><p>The tax at issue in <i>Murdock </i>was invalid because it was unrelated to any legitimate state interest, not because it was of a particular size. Similarly, the provision of the Forsyth County ordinance relating to fees is invalid because it unconstitutionally ties the amount of the fee to the content of the speech and lacks adequate procedural safeguards; no limit on such a fee can remedy these constitutional violations.</p><p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><p>CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom JUSTICE WHITE, JUSTICE SCALIA, and JUSTICE THOMAS join, dissenting.</p><p>We granted certiorari in this case to consider the following question:</p><blockquote><p>\n"Whether the provisions of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution limit the amount of a license fee assessed pursuant to the provisions of a county parade ordinance to a nominal sum or whether the amount of the license fee may take into account the actual expense incident to the administration of the ordinance and the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed, up to the sum of $1,000.00 per day of the activity."

The rest of the opinion</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="138">138</a></p><p>takes up and decides other perceived unconstitutional defects in the Forsyth County ordinance. None of these claims were passed upon by the Court of Appeals; that court decided only that the First Amendment forbade the charging of more than a nominal fee for a permit to parade on public streets. Since that was the question decided by the Court of Appeals below, the question which divides the Courts of Appeals, and the question presented in the petition for certiorari, one would have thought that the Court would at least authoritatively decide, if not limit itself to, that question.</p><p align="center">\nI</p><p>The answer to this question seems to me quite simple, because it was authoritatively decided by this Court more than half a century ago in <i>Cox </i>v. <i>New Hampshire, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/312/569/case.html">312 U. S. 569</a> (1941). There we confronted a state statute which required payment of a license fee of up to $300 to local governments for the right to parade in the public streets. The Supreme Court of New Hampshire had construed the provision as requiring that the amount of the fee be adjusted based on the size of the parade, as the fee "for a circus parade or a celebration procession of length, each drawing crowds of observers, would take into account the greater public expense of policing the spectacle, compared with the slight expense of a less expansive and attractive parade or procession." <i>Id., </i>at 577 (internal quotation marks omitted). Under the state court\'s construction, the fee provision was "not a revenue tax, but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Act and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed." <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted). This Court, in a unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Hughes, upheld the statute, saying:</p><blockquote><p>\n"There is nothing contrary to the Constitution in the charge of a fee limited to the purpose stated. The suggestion that a fiat fee should have been charged fails to take account of the difficulty of framing a fair schedule</p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="139">139</a></p><blockquote><p>\nto meet all circumstances, and we perceive no constitutional ground for denying to local governments that flexibility of adjustment of fees which in the light of varying conditions would tend to conserve rather than impair the liberty sought.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"There is no evidence that the statute has been administered otherwise than in the fair and nondiscriminatory manner which the state court has construed it to require." <i>Ibid.</i></p></blockquote><p>Two years later, in <i>Murdock </i>v. <i>Pennsylvania, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/105/case.html">319 U. S. 105</a> (1943), this Court confronted a municipal ordinance that required payment of a flat license fee for the privilege of canvassing door-to-door to sell one\'s wares. Pursuant to that ordinance, the city had levied the flat fee on a group of Jehovah\'s Witnesses who sought to distribute religious literature door-to-door for a small price. <i>Id., </i>at 106-107. The Court held that the flat license tax, as applied against the hand distribution of religious tracts, was unconstitutional on the ground that it was "a flat tax imposed on the exercise of a privilege granted by the Bill of Rights." <i>Id., </i>at 113. In making this ruling, the Court distinguished <i>Cox </i>by stating that "the fee is not a nominal one, imposed as a regulatory measure and calculated to defray the expense of protecting those on the streets and at home against the abuses of solicitors." 319 U. S., at 116. This language, which suggested that the fee involved in <i>Cox </i>was only nominal, led the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in the present case to conclude that a city is prohibited from charging any more than a nominal fee for a parade permit. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/913/885/">913 F.2d 885</a>, 890891, and n. 6 (1990). But the clear holding of <i>Cox </i>is to the contrary. In that case, the Court expressly recognized that the New Hampshire state statute allowed a city to levy much more than a nominal parade fee, as it stated that the fee provision "had a permissible range from $300 to a nominal amount." <i>Cox </i>v. <i>New Hampshire, supra, </i>at 576. The use of the word "nominal" in <i>Murdock </i>was thus unfortunate, as</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="140">140</a></p><p>it represented a mistaken characterization of the fee statute in <i>Cox. </i>But a mistaken allusion in a later case to the facts of an earlier case does not by itself undermine the holding of the earlier case. The situations in <i>Cox </i>and <i>Murdock </i>were clearly different; the first involved a sliding fee to account for administrative and security costs incurred as a result of a parade on public property, while the second involved a fiat tax on protected religious expression. I believe that the decision in <i>Cox </i>squarely controls the disposition of the question presented in this case, and I therefore would explicitly hold that the Constitution does not limit a parade license fee to a nominal amount.</p><p align="center">\nII</p><p>Instead of deciding the particular question on which we granted certiorari, the Court concludes that the county ordinance is facially unconstitutional because it places too much discretion in the hands of the county administrator and forces parade participants to pay for the cost of controlling those who might oppose their speech. <i>Ante, </i>at 130-137. But, because the lower courts did not pass on these issues, the Court is forced to rely on its own interpretation of the ordinance in making these rulings. The Court unnecessarily reaches out to interpret the ordinance on its own at this stage, even though there are no lower court factual findings on the scope or administration of the ordinance. Because there are no such factual findings, I would not decide at this point whether the ordinance fails for lack of adequate standards to guide discretion or for incorporation of a "heckler\'s veto," but would instead remand the case to the lower courts to initially consider these issues.</p><p>The Court first finds fault with the alleged standardless discretion possessed by the county administrator. The ordinance provides that the administrator "shall adjust the amount to be paid in order to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Ordinance and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed." App. to Pet. for</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="141">141</a></p><p>Cert. 119. In this regard, the ordinance clearly parallels the construction of the statute we upheld in <i>Cox. </i>312 U. S., at 577 (statute did not impose "a revenue tax, but one to meet the expense incident to the administration of the Act and to the maintenance of public order in the matter licensed" (internal quotation marks omitted)). The Court worries, however, about the possibility that the administrator has the discretion to set fees based upon his approval of the message sought to be conveyed, and concludes that "the county\'s authoritative constructio[n] of the ordinance" allows for such a possibility. <i>Ante, </i>at 131. The Court apparently envisions a situation where the administrator would impose a $1,000 parade fee on a group whose message he opposed, but would waive the fee entirely for a similarly situated group with whom he agreed. But the county has never rendered any "authoritative construction" indicating that officials have "unbridled discretion," <i>ante, </i>at 133, in setting parade fees, nor has any lower court so found. In making its own factual finding that the ordinance does allow for standardless fee setting, this Court simply cites four situations in which the administrator set permit fees-two fees of $100, one of $25, and one of $5. <i>Ante, </i>at 132. On the basis of this evidence, the Court finds that the administrator has unbridled discretion to set permit fees. The mere fact that the permit fees differed in amount does not invalidate the ordinance, however, as our decision in <i>Cox </i>clearly allows a governmental entity to adopt an adjustable permit fee scheme. See <i>Cox </i>v. <i>New Hampshire, supra, </i>at 577 ("[W]e perceive no constitutional ground for denying to local governments thee] flexibility of adjustment of fees"). It is true that the Constitution does not permit a system in which the county administrator may vary fees at his pleasure, but there has been no lower court finding that that is what this fledgling ordinance creates. And, given the opportunity, the District Court might find that the county has a policy that precludes the administrator from arbitrarily imposing fees. Of course, the District</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="142">142</a></p><p>Court might find that the administrator does possess too much discretion. In either case, I believe findings by the District Court on the issue would be preferable.</p><p>The Court relies on <i>Ward </i>v. <i>Rock Against Racism, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/781/case.html">491 U. S. 781</a>, 795-796 (1989), for the proposition that the county\'s interpretation of the ordinance must be considered. In that case, however, we relied upon District Court findings concerning New York City\'s limiting interpretation of a noise regulation. <i>Id., </i>at 795. I would prefer to remand this case so that the Court might rely on such express findings here as well.</p><p>The Court\'s second reason for invalidating the ordinance is its belief that any fee imposed will be based in part on the cost of security necessary to control those who <i>oppose </i>the message endorsed by those marching in a parade. Assuming 100 people march in a parade and 10,000 line the route in protest, for example, the Court worries that, under this ordinance, the county will charge a premium to control the hostile crowd of 10,000, resulting in the kind of "heckler\'s veto" we have previously condemned. <i>Ante, </i>at 133-136. But there have been no lower court findings on the question whether or not the county plans to base parade fees on anticipated hostile crowds. It has not done so in any of the instances where it has so far imposed fees. <i>Ante, </i>at 132. And it most certainly did not do so in this case. The District Court below noted that:</p><blockquote><p>\n"[T]he instant ordinance alternatively permits fees to be assessed based upon \'the expense incident to ... the maintenance of public order.\' If the county had applied this portion of the statute, the phrase might run afoul of ... constitutional concerns ....</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"However, in the instant case, plaintiff did not base their <i>[sic] </i>argument upon this phrase, but contended that the mere fact that a $100 fee was imposed is unconstitutional, especially in light of the organization\'s financial circumstances. <i>The evidence was clear that the</i></p></blockquote><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="143">143</a></p><blockquote><p>\nfee was based solely upon the costs of processing the application and plaintiff produced no evidence to the contrary." App. to Pet. for Cert. 14 (emphasis added).</p></blockquote><p>The Court\'s analysis on this issue rests on an assumption that the county will interpret the phrase "maintenance of public order" to support the imposition of fees based on opposition crowds. There is nothing in the record to support this assumption, however, and I would remand for a hearing on this question.</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, I dissent.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
