It is very clear that it cannot.  A subsequent suit may be abated by an allegation of the pendency of a prior suit, but the converse of the proposition is, in personal actions, never true.  The decision of the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia overruling the plea was therefore correct. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="218">Page 14 U. S. 218</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The next question is whether the judgment rendered on the overruling of the plea ought to have been peremptory, or an award of <em>respondeat ouster.</em>  This point is completely settled by authority.  If matter in abatement be pleaded <em>puis darrein continuance,</em> the judgment, if against the defendant, is peremptory as well on demurrer as on trial.</p>\n<p>The last question is whether judgment could be entered up for the plaintiff for the amount of his damages by the court without a writ of inquiry.  This also is completely settled by authority in all cases whether the action is brought for a sum certain or which may be made certain by computation.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
