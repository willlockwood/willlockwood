After a Magistrate denied his motion to withdraw, he appealed to the District Court, contending that forcing him to represent indigent inmates in a complex action requiring trial skills he did not possess would compel him to violate his ethical obligation to take on only those cases he could handle competently and would exceed the court\'s authority under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915(d), which provides that federal courts may "request" an attorney to represent any person claiming <em>in forma pauperis</em> status.

The fact that \xc2\xa7 1915(c) -- which was adopted at the same time as \xc2\xa7 1915(d) -- imposes mandatory duties on court officers and witnesses in <em>in forma pauperis</em> cases demonstrates that Congress knew how to require service when it deemed compulsory service appropriate.  The conclusion that \xc2\xa7 1915(d) evinces a desire to permit attorneys to decline representation of indigent litigants if in their view their personal, professional, or ethical concerns bid them do so is bolstered by the fact that Congress, when it passed \xc2\xa7 1915(d) in 1892, was aware of, but chose not to replicate, the language of various state statutes providing for the "appointment" or "assignment" of counsel in <em>in forma pauperis</em> proceedings; by the fact that no reported pre-1892 American or English decision held that a lawyer could be sanctioned for declining representation without compensation; and by the fact that other pre- and post-1892 federal statutes providing for court-ordered representation specify that the court could "assign" or "appoint" attorneys, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="297">Page 490 U.

We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1915(d) provides:</p>\n<p>"The court may request an attorney to represent any [person claiming <em>in forma pauperis</em> status] unable to employ counsel and may dismiss the case if the allegation of poverty is untrue, or if satisfied that the action is frivolous or malicious."</p>\n<p>In <em>Nelson v. Redfield Lithograph Printing,</em> 728 F.2d 1003, 1005 (1984), the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit ordered</p>\n<p>"the chief judge of each district to seek the cooperation of the bar associations and the federal practice committees of the judge\'s district to obtain a sufficient list of attorneys practicing throughout the district so as to supply the court with competent attorneys who will serve in <em>pro bono</em> situations,"</p>\n<p>such as <em>in forma pauperis</em> proceedings conducted under 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915.  The District Court for the Southern District of Iowa heeded the Court of Appeals\' command.  Under the system in force since February, 1986, once the District Court has determined that an indigent party qualifies for representation under \xc2\xa7 1915(d), the Clerk of the Court forwards a copy of the court file to the Volunteer Lawyers Project (VLP), a joint venture of the Legal Services Corporation of Iowa and the Iowa State Bar Association.  The VLP keeps a copy of a roster prepared by the District Court of all attorneys admitted to practice before the court and in good standing.  After deleting the names of lawyers who have volunteered for VLP referrals of <em>pro bono</em> state court cases, the VLP selects lawyers from the list nonalphabetically for \xc2\xa7 1915(d) assignments. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Lawyers who </p><p><a class="page-number" name="299">Page 490 U. S. 299</a></p><p> are chosen under the plan may apply to the District Court for reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs.  They may also keep any fee award provided by statute, but are not guaranteed even minimal compensation for their own services.  The VLP assists lawyers assigned to litigate in areas of the law with which they are unfamiliar by providing written materials, holding periodic seminars, and facilitating consultations with experienced attorneys.</p>\n<p>Petitioner Mallard was admitted to practice before the District Court in January, 1987, and entered his first appearance the following month.  In June, 1987, he was asked by the VLP to represent two current inmates and one former inmate who sued prison officials under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983, alleging that prison guards and administrators had filed false disciplinary reports against them, mistreated them physically, and endangered their lives by exposing them as informants.  After reviewing the case file, Mallard filed a motion to withdraw with the District Court.  In his motion, petitioner stated that he had no familiarity with the legal issues presented in the case, that he lacked experience in deposing and cross-examining witnesses, and that he would willingly volunteer his services in an area in which he possessed some expertise, such as bankruptcy and securities law.   App. 4-8.  The VLP opposed petitioner\'s motion, claiming that he was competent, that he had an ethical duty to do whatever was necessary to try the case, and that permitting an exception to the rule of assignment would create a dangerous precedent.  A Magistrate denied petitioner\'s motion.</p>\n<p>Mallard then appealed to the District Court.  Although he reiterated his unfamiliarity with \xc2\xa7 1983 actions, he contended that he should be permitted to withdraw not because of his inexperience in interpreting the statute and its case law, but </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 490 U. S. 300</a></p><p> because he was not a litigator by training or temperament.  Forcing him to represent indigent inmates in a complex action requiring depositions and discovery, cross-examination of witnesses, and other trial skills, Mallard asserted, would compel him to violate his ethical obligation to take on only those cases he could handle competently and would exceed the court\'s authority under \xc2\xa7 1915(d).  <em>Id.</em> at 19-29.  In an accompanying affidavit, Mallard added:</p>\n<p>"I do not like the role of confronting other persons in a litigation setting, accusing them of misdeeds, or questioning their veracity.  Because of my reluctance to become involved in these activities, I do not feel confident that I would be effective in litigating a case such as the instant case."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 38.</p>\n<p>Unmoved, the District Court upheld the Magistrate\'s decision.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a-4a.  Based on the quality of petitioner\'s brief in support of his motion to withdraw, the court pronounced him competent, notwithstanding his very slight acquaintance with trial litigation.  The court also held that \xc2\xa7 1915(d) empowers federal courts to make compulsory appointments in civil actions.  In November, 1987, Mallard sought a writ of mandamus from the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit to compel the District Court to allow his withdrawal.  The Court of Appeals denied the petition without opinion.  <em>Id.</em> at 1a.  We granted certiorari to resolve a conflict among the Courts of Appeals over whether \xc2\xa7 1915(d) authorizes compulsory assignments of attorneys in civil cases.

We now reverse.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Interpretation of a statute must begin with the statute\'s language.  <em>E.g.,  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/case.html">489 U.

Landreth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/681/case.html">471 U. S. 681</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/471/681/case.html#685">471 U. S. 685</a></span> (1985).  Section 1915(d)\'s operative term is "request":  "The court may request an attorney to represent" an indigent litigant.  The import of the term seems plain.  To request that somebody do something is to express a desire that he do it, even though he may not generally be disciplined or sanctioned if he declines.  Of course, somebody who frequently refuses another person\'s requests might not win that person\'s favor.  A soldier who regularly fails to fulfill his superior\'s requests might not rise in the ranks as rapidly as would someone who was more compliant.  But somebody who refuses a request, as the word is ordinarily used, may not be penalized formally for doing so, as a soldier who disobeyed orders might be court-martialed.  In everyday speech, the closest synonyms of the verb "request" are "ask," "petition," and "entreat."  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Webster\'s New International Dictionary 1929 (3d ed.1981); Black\'s Law Dictionary 1172 (5th ed.1979).  The verbs "require" and "demand" are not usually interchangeable with it.</p>\n<p>There is little reason to think that Congress did not intend "request" to bear its most common meaning when it used the word in \xc2\xa7 1915(d).  Although "request" may double for "demand" or "command" when it is used as a noun, particularly when employed as a term of art in connection with wills, trusts, and probate proceedings, its ordinary and natural signification when used as a verb was precatory when Congress enacted the provision now appearing at 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915(d) in 1892.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Black\'s Law Dictionary 1027 (1st ed. 1891); 2 B. Abbott, Dictionary of Terms and Phrases Used in American or English Jurisprudence 415 (1879); 7 Judicial and Statutory Definitions of Words and Phrases 6120-6122 (West 1905).</p>\n<p>Perhaps the clearest proof that Congress did not intend \xc2\xa7 1915(d) to license compulsory appointments of counsel is the contrast between that subsection and \xc2\xa7 1915(c).  Whereas \xc2\xa7 1915(d) merely empowers a court to <em>request</em> an attorney </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 490 U. S. 302</a></p><p> to represent a litigant proceeding <em>in forma pauperis,</em> \xc2\xa7 1915(c) -- adopted at the very same time as \xc2\xa7 1915(d) -- treats court officers and witnesses differently:</p>\n<p>"The officers of the court <em>shall</em> issue and serve all process, and perform all duties in such cases.  Witnesses <em>shall</em> attend as in other cases, and the same remedies shall be available as are provided for by law in other cases."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Congress evidently knew how to require service when it deemed compulsory service appropriate.  Its decision to allow federal courts to <em>request</em> attorneys to represent impoverished litigants, rather than command, as in the case of court officers, that lawyers <em>shall</em> or <em>must</em> take on cases assigned to them, bespeaks an intent not to authorize mandatory appointments of counsel. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>An examination of state statutes governing <em>in forma pauperis</em> proceedings at the time \xc2\xa7 1915(d) became law bolsters this conclusion.  By the late 19th century, at least 12 States had statutes permitting courts to assign counsel to represent indigent litigants.  The Congress that adopted \xc2\xa7 1915(d) was undoubtedly aware of those statutes, for the brief and otherwise unilluminating Report of the House Judiciary Committee states that the bill containing \xc2\xa7 1915(d) was designed to enable persons unable to afford legal representation to avail themselves of the courts, as "[m]any humane and enlightened States" that had similar laws allowed them to do.  H.R.Rep. No. 1079, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 2 (1892).  None of those state statutes, however, provided that a court could merely <em>request</em> that an attorney serve without compensation.  All of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 490 U. S. 303</a></p><p> them provided instead that a court could <em>assign</em> or <em>appoint</em> counsel.  Ark.Stat. \xc2\xa7 1053 (1884) (assign); Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 26, \xc2\xa7 3 (1845) (assign); Ind.Rev.Stat., Vol. 2, pt. 2, ch. 1, Art. 2, \xc2\xa7 15 (1852) (assign); Ky.Stat. \xc2\xa7 884 (1915) (Act of May 27, 1892) (assign); Mo.Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7 2918 (1889) (assign); N.J. Gen.Stat., Vol. 2, Practice \xc2\xa7 369, p. 2598 (1896) (enacted 1799) (assign); 1876 N.Y. Laws, ch. 448, Art. 3, \xc2\xa7 460 (assign); 1869 N.C.Pub.Laws, ch. 96, \xc2\xa7 2 (assign); Tenn.Code \xc2\xa7 3980 (1858) (appoint and assign); Tex.Rev.Stat., Art. 1125 (1879) (enacted 1846) (appoint); Va.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 3538 (1904) (appeared in 1849 Code) (assign); W.Va.Code, ch. 138, \xc2\xa7 1 (1891) (assign).  <em>Cf.</em> N.Mex.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 2289 (1884) (judge may appoint attorney to represent Territory if Territory\'s attorneys are unable to attend by reason of sickness or inability); Nev.Comp.Laws \xc2\xa7 3126 (1900) (court may appoint attorney to appear on behalf of absent defendant in certain contract actions).  To the extent that the "assignment" or "appointment" of counsel denotes the imposition of a duty to undertake representation that courts may enforce, Congress\' decision to allow the federal courts to do no more than "request" attorneys to serve, in full awareness of more stringent state practices, seems to evince a desire to permit attorneys to decline representation of indigent litigants if in their view their personal, professional, or ethical concerns bid them do so.</p>\n<p>Moreover, the extent to which state statutes empowering courts to "assign" or "appoint" counsel in <em>in forma pauperis</em> proceedings also authorized courts to sanction attorneys who refused to serve without compensation is unclear, because few appointments were made pursuant to those statutes, because many legal proceedings went unrecorded, and because lawyers seem rarely to have balked at courts\' assignments.  It is nevertheless significant that no reported decision exists in the above States prior to 1892 holding that a lawyer could not decline representation without compensation, <em>see</em> Shapiro, The Enigma of the Lawyer\'s Duty to Serve, 55 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 490 U. S. 304</a></p><p> N.Y.U.L.Rev. 735, 749-762 (1980) (hereinafter Shapiro), for it suggests that Congress did not intend to replicate a system of coercive appointments when it enacted \xc2\xa7 1915(d), particularly when it used the weaker verb "request" in place of the words "assign" or "appoint."  English precedents from the 15th to the late 19th century, on which the States apparently relied and which Congress might have had in mind, were equally murky.  Few appointments were made in either civil or criminal cases, and although sergeants-at-law were expected to represent indigent persons upon demand of the court, they held public office and were court officers in a much fuller sense than advocates who appeared before it.  Again, no reported decisions involve the imposition of sanctions on lawyers unwilling to serve.  <em>See id.</em> at 740-749.  Professor Shapiro concludes:</p>\n<p>"To justify coerced, uncompensated legal services on the basis of a firm tradition in England and the United States is to read into that tradition a story that is not there."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 753. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 490 U. S. 305</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Comparing \xc2\xa7 1915(d) with similar federal statutes strengthens our conclusion that Congress did not authorize mandatory appointments.  The sole federal statute antedating \xc2\xa7 1915(d) that provided for court-ordered representation allowed a capital defendant "to make his full defence by counsel learned in the law" and stated that</p>\n<p>"the court before whom such person shall be tried, or some judge thereof, shall . . . immediately, upon his request . . . <em>assign</em> to such person such counsel, not exceeding two, as such person shall desire. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 490 U. S. 306</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Act of April 30, 1790, ch. 9, \xc2\xa7 29, 1 Stat. 118, <em>presently codified as amended at</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3005 (emphasis added).  Thus, when Congress enacted \xc2\xa7 1915(d), the verb "assign" was already part of the federal statutory lexicon; Congress\' decision to depart from prior usage in fashioning a rule for civil cases [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] involving indigent litigants might be taken to display a reluctance to require attorneys to serve, even though Congress apparently mandated service in the much more serious case of criminal defendants facing the death penalty. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>This inference finds additional support in Congress\' actions subsequent to \xc2\xa7 1915(d)\'s enactment.  Every federal statute still in force that was passed after 1892 and that authorizes courts to provide counsel states that courts may "assign" or "appoint" attorneys, just as did the 1790 capital representation statute.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3006A (1982 ed. and Supp. V) (appoint; criminal defendant); 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 3503(c) (assign; criminal defendant at deposition to preserve testimony); 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 4109 (appoint; proceeding to verify offender\'s consent to transfer to or from United States); 25 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1912(b) (appoint; Indian child custody proceedings); 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1971(f) (assign; defendant in voting rights case); 42 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 490 U.

Congress\' decision to promulgate these apparently coercive representation statutes when \xc2\xa7 1915(d) was already on the books and after it had been extended to cover criminal as well as civil cases, <em>see</em> Act of June 25, 1910, Pub.L. 317, ch. 435, 36 Stat. 866, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] suggests that \xc2\xa7 1915(d)\'s use of "request" instead of "assign" or "appoint" was understood to signify that \xc2\xa7 1915(d) did not authorize compulsory appointments.  In any case, Congress\' enactments after 1892 afford no reason to believe that the plain meaning of \xc2\xa7 1915(d) is not its intended meaning.</p>\n<p>Contrary to respondent\'s assertion, Brief for Respondent 7-9, construing \xc2\xa7 1915(d) to allow courts to ask, but not compel, lawyers to represent indigent litigants does not render \xc2\xa7 1915(d) a nullity.  Respondent contends that statutory authorization is unnecessary for a court simply to ask an attorney to represent someone; \xc2\xa7 1915(d) would be superfluous if it did no more than that, and thus it must be read to confer coercive power upon the federal courts.  Respondent\'s major premise, however, is too strong.  Statutory provisions may simply codify existing rights or powers.  Section 1915(d), for example, authorizes courts to dismiss a "frivolous or malicious" </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 490 U. S. 308</a></p><p> action, but there is little doubt they would have power to do so even in the absence of this statutory provision.  Nor do respondent\'s premises compel its conclusion.  Section 1915(d) plays a useful role in the statutory scheme if it informs lawyers that the court\'s requests to provide legal assistance are <em>appropriate</em> requests, hence not to be ignored or disregarded in the mistaken belief that they are improper, like a judge\'s request to cut short cross-examination so that he can go fishing.  Section 1915(d) may meaningfully be read to legitimize a court\'s request to represent a poor litigant, and therefore to confront a lawyer with an important ethical decision; one need not interpret it to authorize the imposition of sanctions, should a lawyer decide not to serve, in order to give purpose to the provision.

In resting its decision solely on \xc2\xa7 1915(d) -- the only ground for decision properly before us -- the District Court plainly acted beyond its "jurisdiction" as our decisions have interpreted that term, for, as we decide today, \xc2\xa7 1915(d) does not authorize coercive appointments of counsel.  In addition, Mallard had no alternative remedy available to him.  And the principal reasons for our reluctance to condone use of the writ -- the undesirability of making a district court judge a litigant and the inefficiency of piecemeal appellate litigation, <em>see, e.g., Kerr, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/397/case.html#402">428 U.

The District Court Judge was never made a party to this action, nor did Mallard\'s petition attempt to sever one element of the merits litigation from the rest.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 490 U. S. 310</a></p><p> Thus, Mallard discharged his burden of proving that he was entitled to a writ of mandamus, and the Court of Appeals erred when it denied his application.</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>We emphasize that our decision today is limited to interpreting \xc2\xa7 1915(d).  We do not mean to question, let alone denigrate, lawyers\' ethical obligation to assist those who are too poor to afford counsel, or to suggest that requests made pursuant to \xc2\xa7 1915(d) may be lightly declined because they give rise to no ethical claim.  On the contrary, in a time when the need for legal services among the poor is growing and public funding for such services has not kept pace, lawyers\' ethical obligation to volunteer their time and skills <em>pro bono publico</em> is manifest.  Nor do we express an opinion on the question whether the federal courts possess inherent authority to require lawyers to serve.  Although respondents and their <em>amici</em> urge us to affirm the Court of Appeals\' judgment on the ground that the federal courts do have such authority, the District Court did not invoke its inherent power in its opinion below, and the Court of Appeals did not offer this ground for denying Mallard\'s application for a writ of mandamus.  We therefore leave that issue for another day.  We hold only that \xc2\xa7 1915(d) does not authorize the federal courts to make coercive appointments of counsel.  Accordingly, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>In February, 1986, the Iowa State Bar Association sent a letter to all lawyers licensed to practice before the United States District Courts for the Northern and Southern Districts of Iowa describing the referral system.

S. 314</a></span>, the dissent ignores recent scholarship questioning the extent of that authority and casting doubt on unqualified and poorly documented assertions of its existence by contemporary writers, such as Cooley.  <em>See</em> Shapiro 751-753.  In view of the complete absence of precedent evincing state courts\' power to sanction attorneys unwilling to provide free representation, the dissent\'s surmise that Congress meant to grant this power to federal judges, and indeed to confer on them as much authority as judges in the "most progressive" States exercised, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/296/case.html#314">490 U. S. 314</a></span>, seems somewhat extravagant.  Lower federal court decisions construing \xc2\xa7 1915(d) within a decade of its enactment, on which the dissent relies, <em>see id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/296/case.html#316">490 U. S. 316</a></span>, certainly do not support this inference.  On the contrary, they tell against it.  In <em>Whelan v. Manhattan R. Co.,</em> 86 F. 219, 221 (CC SDNY 1898), cited approvingly a year later regarding attorney assignments in <em>Brinkley v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co.,</em> 95 F. 345, 353 (CC WD Tenn. 1899), the court said:</p>\n<p>"If the attorney who brought the action is willing to continue the litigation [without compensation, unless the plaintiff prevails and recovers an amount sufficient to pay him a fair fee], he will be assigned to represent plaintiff; if not, the court will find some other attorney to prosecute her case."</p>\n<p>Courts at the time evidently believed that attorneys were free to decline a judge\'s request to represent an indigent plaintiff under \xc2\xa7 1915(d).</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s claim that Congress intended \xc2\xa7 1915(d) to mirror state statutes permitting coercive appointments seems particularly tenuous when Congress departed from States\' use of the verbs "appoint" and "assign," and when it plainly distinguished between attorneys and salaried court officers in the text of the statute.  To be sure, the statute was introduced in both Houses as an act "providing when plaintiff may sue as a poor person, and when counsel shall be assigned by the court."  23 Cong.Rec. 5199, 6264 (1892).  But the word "assign" does not appear in the statute itself or the relevant section of the United States Code, and it is the statutory language that guides our resolution of this case.  The dicta cited by the dissent, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter">490 U. S. 312</span>-314, regarding lawyers\' obligation as members of a bar to represent poor <em>criminal</em> defendants do not appreciably strengthen its argument that <em>this statutory provision</em> licenses compulsory appointments in <em>civil</em> cases, whatever force they might lend to the contention that federal courts possess inherent authority to compel lawyers to serve, or that attorneys are under a strong ethical obligation to render assistance.</p>\n<p>The dissent\'s further argument that Mallard\'s "admission to practice implicitly included an obligation to participate" in the District Court\'s program for providing representation to indigent civil litigants because the program was established before he joined the bar, <em>see post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/296/case.html#317">490 U. S. 317</a></span>, is equally unavailing.  The District Court\'s program derived its putative authority from \xc2\xa7 1915(d) alone.  <em>See Nelson v. Redfield Lithograph Printing,</em> 728 F.2d 1003 (CA8 1984).  Whether Mallard incurred an obligation to represent indigent civil litigants by virtue of his membership in the bar therefore depends upon whether \xc2\xa7 1915(d) in fact authorizes compulsory representation.  To argue the reverse -- that Mallard assumed an obligation by accepting membership in the bar after the program was in place, hence the program, and derivatively Mallard\'s obligation, must have a legitimate statutory ground in \xc2\xa7 1915(d) -- is simply bootstrapping.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>Although \xc2\xa7 1915(d) now pertains to "the commencement, prosecution or defense of any suit, action or proceeding, civil or criminal, or appeal therein," 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915(a), as originally drafted, it apparently applied only to suits commenced by an indigent person.  Act of July 20, 1892, ch. 209, \xc2\xa7 1, 27 Stat. 252.  Since a private individual may not institute a criminal prosecution, the scope of \xc2\xa7 1915(d) was limited to persons bringing civil suits.  The legislative history of the bill containing \xc2\xa7 1915(d) corroborates this inference.  The House Report refers exclusively to litigation over property.  <em>See</em> H.R.Rep. No. 1079, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 1 (1892).

If the federal courts already had the authority to compel representation, then, by respondent\'s reasoning, \xc2\xa7 1915(d) would have been otiose; respondent would therefore have to conclude, it seems, that the federal courts lacked inherent authority to sanction lawyers for failing to heed the courts\' orders to provide legal counsel free of charge.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>Our decision today speaks to the interpretation of a statute, to the requirements of the law, and not to the professional responsibility of the lawyer.  Lawyers, like all those who practice a profession, have obligations to their calling which exceed their obligations to the State.  Lawyers also have obligations by virtue of their special status as officers of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="311">Page 490 U. S. 311</a></p><p> the court. Accepting a court\'s request to represent the indigent is one of those traditional obligations.  Our judgment here does not suggest otherwise.  To the contrary, it is precisely because our duties go beyond what the law demands that ours remains a noble profession.</p>\n<p>I join in full the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE STEVENS, with whom JUSTICE MARSHALL, JUSTICE BLACKMUN, and JUSTICE O\'CONNOR join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>The relationship between a court and the members of its bar is not defined by statute alone.  The duties of the practitioner are an amalgam of tradition, respect for the profession, the inherent power of the judiciary, and the commands that are set forth in canons of ethics, rules of court, and legislative enactments.  This case involves much more than the parsing of the plain meaning of the word "request" as used in 28 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1915(d).  This case also does not concern the sufficiency of the lawyer\'s reasons for declining an appointment [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] or the sanctions that may be imposed on an attorney who refuses to serve without compensation.  There are, of course, many situations in which a lawyer may properly decline such representation.  He or she may have a conflict of interest, may be engaged in another trial, may already have accepted more than a fair share of the uncompensated burdens that fall upon the profession, or may not have the qualifications for a particular assignment.  As this case comes to us, however, the question is whether a lawyer may seek relief by way of mandamus from the court\'s request simply because he would rather do something else with his time.  For me, the answer is quite plain.</p>\n<p>A few weeks ago we held that the Virgin Islands Bar could not exclude nonresidents from its membership.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/546/case.html">Barnard</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="312">Page 490 U.

In 1892, state courts had statutory authority to order lawyers to render assistance to indigent civil litigants in a dozen States, <em>ante</em> at 304, and common law power to appoint counsel in at least another 10 States. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Congress intended to "open the United States </p><p><a class="page-number" name="315">Page 490 U. S. 315</a></p><p> courts" to impoverished litigants and "to keep pace" with the laws of these "[m]any humane and enlightened States."  H.R.Rep. No. 1079, 52d Cong., 1st Sess., 1-2 (1892).  Congress also intended to insure that the rights of litigants suing diverse parties in the most liberal of these States would not be defeated by the defendant\'s removal of the suit to federal court.  <em>Id.</em> at 1.  To be faithful to the congressional design of ensuring the poor litigant equal justice whether the suit is prosecuted in federal or state court, the statute should be construed to require counsel to serve, absent good reason, when requested to do so by the court.  The Court\'s niggardly construction to the contrary departs from the enlightened laws the Congress intended to track and defeats Congress\' beneficent purpose. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>I attach no particular significance to the difference, if any, between the ordinary meaning of the word "request" used in \xc2\xa7 1915(d) and "assign" and "appoint" used in the various state statutes.  <em>See ante</em> at 302-303.  The federal statute was introduced in the House and the Senate as an Act empowering </p><p><a class="page-number" name="316">Page 490 U. S. 316</a></p><p> courts to "assign" counsel for poor persons, 23 Cong.Rec. 5199, 6264 (1892), and uses the terms "assign" and "request" interchangeably.  Significantly, it is entitled "An Act providing when plaintiff may sue as a poor person and when counsel shall be assigned by the court."  Ch. 209, 27 Stat. 252.  Every contemporary decision uses the word "assign" to describe the judge\'s authority to secure counsel for parties under \xc2\xa7 1915(d).  <em>See Boyle v. Great Northern R. Co.,</em> 63 F. 539 (CC Wash. 1894); <em>Whelan v. Manhattan R. Co.,</em> 86 F. 219, 220-221 (CC SDNY 1898); <em>Brinkley v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co.,</em> 95 F. 345, 353 (CC WD Tenn. 1899); <em>Phillips v. Louisville &amp; N. R. Co.,</em> 153 F. 795 (CC ND Ala.1907), <em>aff\'d,</em> 164 F. 1022 (CA5 1908); <em>United States ex rel. Randolph v. Ross,</em> 298 F. 64 (CA6 1924).  It is evident that the drafters of this statute understood these terms to impose similar obligations, and simply assumed that members of our profession would perform their assigned tasks when requested to do so by the court.</p>\n<p>The notion that this petitioner had an absolute right to have his "motion to withdraw" granted by the District Court -- and therefore that a writ of mandamus may properly issue -- is completely unacceptable to me.  An attorney who has entered an appearance in a case may not withdraw without leave of court, because the court\'s interest in making sure that a litigant is adequately represented and that the orderly prosecution of the lawsuit is not disrupted is paramount to a lawyer\'s personal interest in terminating a relationship with a client.  <em>See, e.g., Ohntrup v. Firearms Center, Inc.,</em> 802 F.2d 676 (CA3 1986); <em>Mekdeci ex rel. Mekdeci v. Merrell National Laboratories,</em> 711 F.2d 1510, 1521-1522 (CA11 1983).  In this unique case, the petitioner apparently filed his motion to withdraw without first entering an appearance -- thus, the motion might more appropriately have been captioned as a "petition to be excused from performing a nonexistent duty to enter an appearance in a pending case."  Indeed, the very fact that the petitioner considered it appropriate to ask the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="317">Page 490 U. S. 317</a></p><p> Magistrate to allow him to "withdraw" is evidence of his recognition of some duty to accept the appointment unless there was a valid excuse for declining it.</p>\n<p>The program adopted by the District Court for the Southern District of Iowa to provide representation for indigent litigants was in operation when petitioner became a member of that court\'s bar.  In my opinion, his admission to practice implicitly included an obligation to participate in that program. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  When a court has established a fair and detailed procedure for the assignment of counsel to indigent litigants, a formal request to a lawyer by the court pursuant to that procedure is tantamount to a command.</p>\n<p>In context, I would therefore construe the word "request" in \xc2\xa7 1915(d) as meaning "respectfully command."  If that is not what Congress intended, the statute is virtually meaningless.  There is no substance to the Court\'s speculation that Congress enacted this provision because of a concern that a court\'s requests to represent a poor litigant might otherwise be "disregarded in the mistaken belief that they are improper."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/296/case.html#308">490 U.

Under District Court Rule 16, each active member of the Virgin Island Bar must remain available to accept appointments to appear on behalf of indigent criminal defendants.  According to the affidavit of the President of the Virgin Islands Bar Association, each member can expect to receive appointments about four times per year.  Once appointed, it is the duty of the lawyer"</p>\n<p>"to communicate with the defendant at his place of incarceration as promptly as possible and not later than five days from the date of the clerk\'s mailing of the order of appointment."</p>\n<p>Although the statute does not specifically so provide, the District Court interprets Rule 16 to require that only the appointed attorney may appear on behalf of the criminal defendant.  The District Court found that, in light of this individual appearance requirement and the strict time constraints imposed by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 3161-3174, it would be virtually impossible for this system of appointed counsel to work with nonresident attorneys.</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"As respondents point out, if handling indigent criminal cases is a requirement of admission to the Bar, a nonresident knows that he must either appear himself or arrange with a resident lawyer to handle the case when he is unavailable.

In his treatise on Constitutional Limitations, written in 1868, Professor Cooley wrote:</p>\n<p>"[T]he humanity of the law has provided that, if the prisoner is unable to employ counsel, the court may designate someone to defend him who shall be paid by the government; but when no such provision is made, it is a duty which counsel so designated owes to his profession, to the court engaged in the trial, and to the cause of humanity and justice not to withhold his assistance nor spare his best exertions in the defence of one who has the double misfortune to be stricken by poverty and accused of crime.  No one is at liberty to decline such an appointment, and few, it is to be hoped, would be disposed to do so."</p>\n<p>T. Cooley, Constitutional Limitations 334 (2d ed. 1871) (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>In a footnote, Cooley added:</p>\n<p>"[A] court has the right to require the service whether compensation is to be made or not; and that counsel who should decline to perform it, for no other reason than that the law does not provide pecuniary compensation, is unworthy to hold his responsible office in the administration of justice."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 334, n. 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/6" name="F2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s reliance on a recent law review article that casts doubt on the power of state courts to sanction attorneys who refused to represent indigents largely misses the point.  In its present posture, arising on petitioner\'s request for a writ of mandamus, the question in this case involves a court\'s power to order an attorney to represent an indigent party, not its power to sanction an attorney who fails to obey that order.  Justices Cardozo, Field, and Sutherland all recognized that a court has such power and, at the time \xc2\xa7 1915(d) was enacted, the state courts routinely appointed counsel who were obliged to serve.
