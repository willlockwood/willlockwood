No such paper is found annexed to the bill of exceptions nor in any manner referred to or marked or identified as being a part of the bill of exceptions, or as the paper which was offered in evidence. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="189">Page 71 U. S. 189</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The suit, being in the Circuit Court for the District of Louisiana, was commenced by petition, and according to the practice in such cases, there is annexed to the petition a copy of the note sued on and of the protest and certificate of notice to the endorsers.  But this is merely a copy attached to and a part of the pleading, and is certainly not the paper which was offered in evidence.  It may or may not be a perfect copy of that paper, but whether it is so or not, it is certain that it does not become a part of the bill of exceptions by being attached to the pleading.</p>\n<p>If a paper which is to constitute a part of a bill of exceptions is not incorporated into the body of the bill, it must be annexed to it or so marked by letter, number, or other means of identification mentioned in the bill as to leave no doubt, when found in the record, that it is the one referred to in the bill of exceptions.</p>\n<p>There is nothing of the kind here, and as we must presume the ruling of the court to be right in the absence of anything showing it to be wrong, the judgment must be</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>|71 U.S. 187|</p>\n<p>* Stat. of 1855, p. 48, \xc2\xa7 7.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
