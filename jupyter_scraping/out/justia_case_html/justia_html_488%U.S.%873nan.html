California, <a href="/cases/federal/us/402/183/case.html#208">402 U.S. 183, 208</a>, 1467 (1971 )). Dissipating this all-important sense of responsibility, we wrote, could easily result in the jury\'s deciding to " \'send a message\' of extreme disapproval for the defendant\'s acts" without ever having determined that a death sentence was in order. 472 U.S., at 331-332, 105 S.Ct. at 2641. </p><p> The prosecutor\'s statement here-admonishing the jurors not to " \'feel like it is you[r] [decision]\' " and urging them not to " \'have it weigh too heavily on you because that was my decision\' "-is designed for only one reason: to dissipate the jury\'s sense of personal responsibility for this most awesome of decisions. See, e.g., Tucker v. Kemp, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/802/1293/">802 F.2d 1293</a> ( 11th Cir.1986) (en banc), (concluding that a "prosecutorial expertise" argument was impermissible under Caldwell where the prosecutor suggested that others, including the prosecutor and the police, bore partial responsibility for imposition of the death penalty) cert. denied, 480 U.S. 911 (1987). </p><p> Nor am I persuaded by the State\'s argument that petitioner is barred on direct appeal from raising his Caldwell claim either because of his failure to object at trial or because of his failure to object with more specificity on appeal below. In sanctioning the prosecutor\'s statement that deciding whether to execute petitioner should not " \'weigh heavily on you,\' " the judge committed what can only be deemed a plain error. And in his brief to the Georgia Supreme Court, petitioner-though not complaining specifically that Caldwell had been violated-sought reversal generally because of the "inflammatory and prejudicial" argumentation of the prosecutor, a description which richly applies to the remarks quoted above. </p><p> I therefore dissent.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
