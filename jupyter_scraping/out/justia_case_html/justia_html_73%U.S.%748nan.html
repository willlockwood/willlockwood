The bill then prayed that the judgment might be decreed a valid and subsisting lien on the road, appurtenances, and franchises and that they might be decreed to be sold to satisfy it.  The defendants put in an answer, and the cause went to the proofs.  This was the second suit of the two above-mentioned suits.  Much testimony was taken on both sides which was found in the record, and the court below, after full consideration, dismissed the bill in the principal suit on the merits as to the Chamberlain judgment and decreed in favor of the force and effect of that judgment, but dismissed the cross-bill for the reason that the two companies were incompetent to litigate the matter set forth in that bill on account of the residence of the parties, both being corporations of the State of Wisconsin. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="750">Page 73 U.

It was filed for the purpose of enforcing the judgment, which was in the circuit court, and could be filed in no other court, and was but ancillary to and dependent upon the original suit -- an appropriate proceeding for the purpose of obtaining satisfaction.  The lease was in the nature of a mortgage, and held only as collateral security, and followed the judgment. <span class="l-asterix"><a href="/cases/federal/us/73/748/case.html">*</a></span></p>\n<p><em>The decree in the first suit must be affirmed, and that in the second reversed, and the cause remitted to the court below to enter a decree in conformity with this opinion.</em></p>\n<p>* <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/65/450/case.html#451">Freeman v.
