In postconviction proceedings, he claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence before he entered the plea, but also told him not to worry about deportation since he had lived in this country so long.  He alleges that he would have gone to trial had he not received this incorrect advice.  The Kentucky Supreme Court denied Padilla postconviction relief on the ground that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s effective-assistance-of-counsel guarantee does not protect defendants from erroneous deportation advice because deportation is merely a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d consequence of a conviction.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because counsel must inform a client whether his plea carries a risk of deportation, Padilla has sufficiently alleged that his counsel was constitutionally deficient.

Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Changes to immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conviction.  While once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited judges\xe2\x80\x99 authority to alleviate deportation\xe2\x80\x99s harsh consequences.  Because the drastic measure of deportation or removal is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes, the importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.  Thus, as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.  Pp.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, applies to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cthe effective assistance of competent counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McMann</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/index.html">397 U. S. 759</a>, 771.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he sought about deportation concerned only collateral matters.  However, this Court has never distinguished between direct and collateral consequences in defining the scope of constitutionally \xe2\x80\x9creasonable professional assistance\xe2\x80\x9d required under <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 689.  The question whether that distinction is appropriate need not be considered in this case because of the unique nature of deportation.  Although removal proceedings are civil, deportation is intimately related to the criminal process, which makes it uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.  Because that distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland</em> claim concerning the specific risk of deportation, advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0To satisfy <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s two-prong inquiry, counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation must fall \xe2\x80\x9cbelow an objective standard of reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d 466 U. S., at 688, and there must be \xe2\x80\x9ca reasonable probability that, but for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 694.  The first, constitutional deficiency, is necessarily linked to the legal community\xe2\x80\x99s practice and expectations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 688.  The weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the deportation risk.  And this Court has recognized the importance to the client of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]reserving the \xe2\x80\xa6 right to remain in the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cpreserving the possibility of\xe2\x80\x9d discretionary relief from deportation.  <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 323.  Thus, this is not a hard case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s advice was incorrect.  There will, however, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a plea are unclear.  In those cases, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry adverse immigration consequences.  But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was here, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.  Accepting Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s allegations as true, he has sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s first prong.  Whether he can satisfy the second prong, prejudice, is left for the Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule\xe2\x80\x94that <em>Strickland </em>should be applied to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim only to the extent that he has alleged affirmative misadvice\xe2\x80\x94is unpersuasive.  And though this Court must be careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas, the 25 years since <em>Strickland </em>was first applied to ineffective-assistance claims at the plea stage have shown that pleas are less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions after a trial.  Also, informed consideration of possible deportation can benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants, who may be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.  This decision will not open the floodgates to challenges of convictions obtained through plea bargains.  Cf. <em>Hill </em>v. <em>Lockhart, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U.

Padilla served this Nation with honor as a member of the U. S. Armed Forces during the Vietnam War.  He now faces deportation after pleading guilty to the transportation of a large amount of marijuana in his tractor-trailer in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this postconviction proceeding, Padilla claims that his counsel not only failed to advise him of this consequence prior to his entering the plea, but also told him that he \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98did not have to worry about immigration status since he had been in the country so long.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  253 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 482, 483 (Ky. 2008).  Padilla relied on his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s erroneous advice when he pleaded guilty to the drug charges that made his deportation virtually mandatory.  He alleges that he would have insisted on going to trial if he had not received incorrect advice from his attorney.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Assuming the truth of his allegations, the Supreme Court of Kentucky denied Padilla postconviction relief without the benefit of an evidentiary hearing.  The court held that the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s guarantee of effective assistance of counsel does not protect a criminal defendant from erroneous advice about deportation because it is merely a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d consequence of his conviction.  <em>Id.</em>, at 485.  In its view, neither counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to advise petitioner about the possibility of removal, nor counsel\xe2\x80\x99s incorrect advice, could provide a basis for relief.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to decide whether, as a matter of federal law, Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s counsel had an obligation to advise him that the offense to which he was pleading guilty would result in his removal from this country.  We agree with Padilla that constitutionally competent counsel would have advised him that his conviction for drug distribution made him subject to automatic deportation.  Whether he is entitled to relief depends on whether he has been prejudiced, a matter that we do not address.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The landscape of federal immigration law has changed dramatically over the last 90 years.  While once there was only a narrow class of deportable offenses and judges wielded broad discretionary authority to prevent deportation, immigration reforms over time have expanded the class of deportable offenses and limited the authority of judges to alleviate the harsh consequences of deportation.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic measure\xe2\x80\x9d of deportation or removal, <em>Fong Haw Tan</em> v. <em>Phelan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/333/6/index.html">333 U. S. 6</a>, 10 (1948), is now virtually inevitable for a vast number of noncitizens convicted of crimes.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Nation\xe2\x80\x99s first 100 years was \xe2\x80\x9ca period of unimpeded immigration.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Gordon &amp; H. Rosenfield, Immigration Law and Procedure \xc2\xa71.(2)(a), p. 5 (1959).  An early effort to empower the President to order the deportation of those immigrants he \xe2\x80\x9cjudge[d] dangerous to the peace and safety of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d Act of June 25, 1798, ch. 58, 1 Stat. 571, was short lived and unpopular.  Gordon \xc2\xa71.2, at 5.  It was not until 1875 that Congress first passed a statute barring convicts and prostitutes from entering the country, Act of Mar. 3, 1875, ch. 141, 18 Stat. 477.  Gordon \xc2\xa71.2b, at 6.  In 1891, Congress added to the list of excludable persons those \xe2\x80\x9cwho have been convicted of a felony or other infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  Act of Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Immigration and Nationality Act of 1917 (1917 Act) brought \xe2\x80\x9cradical changes\xe2\x80\x9d to our law.  S. Rep. No. 1515, 81st Cong., 2d Sess., pp. 54\xe2\x80\x9355 (1950).  For the first time in our history, Congress made classes of noncitizens deportable based on conduct committed on American soil.  <em>Id.</em>, at 55.  Section 19 of the 1917 Act authorized the deportation of \xe2\x80\x9cany alien who is hereafter sentenced to imprisonment for a term of one year or more because of conviction in this country of a crime involving moral turpitude, committed within five years after the entry of the alien to the United States \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  39 Stat. 889.  And \xc2\xa719 also rendered deportable noncitizen recidivists who commit two or more crimes of moral turpitude at any time after entry.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Congress did not, however, define the term \xe2\x80\x9cmoral turpitude.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the 1917 Act was \xe2\x80\x9cradical\xe2\x80\x9d because it authorized deportation as a consequence of certain convictions, the Act also included a critically important procedural protection to minimize the risk of unjust deportation: At the time of sentencing or within 30 days thereafter, the sentencing judge in both state and federal prosecutions had the power to make a recommendation \xe2\x80\x9cthat such alien shall not be deported.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 890.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  This procedure, known as a judicial recommendation against deportation, or JRAD, had the effect of binding the Executive to prevent deportation; the statute was \xe2\x80\x9cconsistently \xe2\x80\xa6 interpreted as giving the sentencing judge conclusive authority to decide whether a particular conviction should be disregarded as a basis for deportation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Janvier</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 793 F.\xc2\xa02d 449, 452 (CA2 1986).  Thus, from 1917 forward, there was no such creature as an automatically deportable offense.  Even as the class of deportable offenses expanded, judges retained discretion to ameliorate unjust results on a case-by-case basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although narcotics offenses\xe2\x80\x94such as the offense at issue in this case\xe2\x80\x94provided a distinct basis for deportation as early as 1922,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] the JRAD procedure was generally available to avoid deportation in narcotics convictions.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>O\xe2\x80\x99Rourke</em>, 213 F.\xc2\xa02d 759, 762 (CA8 1954).  Except for \xe2\x80\x9ctechnical, inadvertent and insignificant violations of the laws relating to narcotics,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>,<em> </em>it appears that courts treated narcotics offenses as crimes involving moral turpitude for purposes of the 1917 Act\xe2\x80\x99s broad JRAD provision.  See <em>ibid. </em>(recognizing that until 1952 a JRAD in a narcotics case \xe2\x80\x9cwas effective to prevent deportation\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <em>Dang</em> <em>Nam</em> v. <em>Bryan</em>, 74 F.\xc2\xa02d 379, 380\xe2\x80\x93381 (CA9 1934))).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of both the steady expansion of deportable offenses and the significant ameliorative effect of a JRAD, it is unsurprising that, in the wake of <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984), the Second Circuit held that the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel applies to a JRAD request or lack thereof, see <em>Janvier,</em> 793 F.\xc2\xa02d 449.  See also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Castro</em>, 26 F.\xc2\xa03d 557 (CA5 1994).  In its view, seeking a JRAD was \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the sentencing\xe2\x80\x9d process, <em>Janvier</em>, 793 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 452, even if deportation itself is a civil action.  Under the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, the impact of a conviction on a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remain in the country was a central issue to be resolved during the sentencing process\xe2\x80\x94not merely a collateral matter outside the scope of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duty to provide effective representation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0However, the JRAD procedure is no longer part of our law.  Congress first circumscribed the JRAD provision in the 1952 Immigration and Nationality Act (INA),[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] and in 1990 Congress entirely eliminated it, 104 Stat. 5050.  In 1996, Congress also eliminated the Attorney General\xe2\x80\x99s authority to grant discretionary relief from deportation, 110 Stat. 3009\xe2\x80\x93596, an authority that had been exercised to prevent the deportation of over 10,000 noncitizens during the 5-year period prior to 1996, <em>INS</em> v. <em>St. Cyr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/289/index.html">533 U. S. 289</a>, 296 (2001).  Under contemporary law, if a noncitizen has committed a removable offense after the 1996 effective date of these amendments, his removal is practically inevitable but for the possible exercise of limited remnants of equitable discretion vested in the Attorney General to cancel removal for noncitizens convicted of particular classes of offenses.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71229b.  Subject to limited exceptions, this discretionary relief is not available for an offense related to trafficking in a controlled substance.  See \xc2\xa71101(a)(43)(B); \xc2\xa71228.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These changes to our immigration law have dramatically raised the stakes of a noncitizen\xe2\x80\x99s criminal conviction.  The importance of accurate legal advice for noncitizens accused of crimes has never been more important.  These changes confirm our view that, as a matter of federal law, deportation is an integral part\xe2\x80\x94indeed, sometimes the most important part\xc2\xa0[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]\xe2\x80\x94of the penalty that may be imposed on noncitizen defendants who plead guilty to specified crimes.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before deciding whether to plead guilty, a defendant is entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cthe effective assistance of competent counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McMann</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/index.html">397 U. S. 759</a>, 771 (1970); <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 686.  The Supreme Court of Kentucky rejected Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness claim on the ground that the advice he sought about the risk of deportation concerned only collateral matters, <em>i.e.</em>, those matters not within the sentencing authority of the state trial court.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  253 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 483\xe2\x80\x93484 (citing <em>Commonwealth </em>v. <em>Fuartado</em>, 170 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 384 (2005)).  In its view, \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral consequences are outside the scope of representation required by the Sixth Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d and, therefore, the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure of defense counsel to advise the defendant of possible deportation consequences is not cognizable as a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  253 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d, at 483.  The Kentucky high court is far from alone in this view.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We, however, have never applied a distinction between direct and collateral consequences to define the scope of constitutionally \xe2\x80\x9creasonable professional assistance\xe2\x80\x9d required under <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 689.  Whether that distinction is appropriate is a question we need not consider in this case because of the unique nature of deportation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have long recognized that deportation is a particularly severe \xe2\x80\x9cpenalty,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Fong Yue Ting</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/149/698/index.html">149 U. S. 698</a>, 740 (1893); but it is not, in a strict sense, a criminal sanction.  Although removal proceedings are civil in nature, see <em>INS</em> v. <em>Lopez-Mendoza</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/1032/index.html">468 U. S. 1032</a>, 1038 (1984), deportation is nevertheless intimately related to the criminal process.  Our law has enmeshed criminal convictions and the penalty of deportation for nearly a century, see Part I, <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x937.  And, importantly, recent changes in our immigration law have made removal nearly an automatic result for a broad class of noncitizen offenders.  Thus, we find it \xe2\x80\x9cmost difficult\xe2\x80\x9d to divorce the penalty from the conviction in the deportation context.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, 686 F.\xc2\xa02d 35, 38 (CADC 1982).  Moreover, we are quite confident that noncitizen defendants facing a risk of deportation for a particular offense find it even more difficult.  See <em>St. Cyr</em>, 533 U. S., at 322 (\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be little doubt that, as a general matter, alien defendants considering whether to enter into a plea agreement are acutely aware of the immigration consequences of their convictions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Deportation as a consequence of a criminal conviction is, because of its close connection to the criminal process, uniquely difficult to classify as either a direct or a collateral consequence.  The collateral versus direct distinction is thus ill-suited to evaluating a <em>Strickland</em> claim concerning the specific risk of deportation.  We conclude that advice regarding deportation is not categorically removed from the ambit of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  <em>Strickland</em> applies to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Strickland</em>, we first determine whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s representation \xe2\x80\x9cfell below an objective standard of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  466 U.

Likewise, we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cpreserving the possibility of\xe2\x80\x9d discretionary relief from deportation under \xc2\xa7212(c) of the 1952 INA, 66 Stat. 187, repealed by Congress in 1996, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have been one of the principal benefits sought by defendants deciding whether to accept a plea offer or instead to proceed to trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>St. Cyr</em>, 533 U.

We expected that counsel who were unaware of the discretionary relief measures would \xe2\x80\x9cfollo[w] the advice of numerous practice guides\xe2\x80\x9d to advise themselves of the importance of this particular form of discretionary relief.  <em>Ibid.,</em> n. 50.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case, the terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence for Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  See 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71227(a)(2)(B)(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cAny alien who at any time after admission has been convicted of a violation of (or a conspiracy or attempt to violate) any law or regulation of a State, the United States or a foreign country relating to a controlled substance\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, other than a single offense involving possession for one\xe2\x80\x99s own use of 30 grams or less of marijuana, is deportable\xe2\x80\x9d).  Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s counsel could have easily determined that his plea would make him eligible for deportation simply from reading the text of the statute, which addresses not some broad classification of crimes but specifically commands removal for all controlled substances convictions except for the most trivial of marijuana possession offenses.  Instead, Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s counsel provided him false assurance that his conviction would not result in his removal from this country.  This is not a hard case in which to find deficiency: The consequences of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s plea could easily be determined from reading the removal statute, his deportation was presumptively mandatory, and his counsel\xe2\x80\x99s advice was incorrect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Immigration law can be complex, and it is a legal specialty of its own.  Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it.  There will, therefore, undoubtedly be numerous situations in which the deportation consequences of a particular plea are unclear or uncertain.  The duty of the private practitioner in such cases is more limited.  When the law is not succinct and straightforward (as it is in many of the scenarios posited by Justice Alito), a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration consequences.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  But when the deportation consequence is truly clear, as it was in this case, the duty to give correct advice is equally clear.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accepting his allegations as true, Padilla has sufficiently alleged constitutional deficiency to satisfy the first prong of <em>Strickland</em>.  Whether Padilla is entitled to relief on his claim will depend on whether he can satisfy <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s second prong, prejudice, a matter we leave to the Kentucky courts to consider in the first instance.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Solicitor General has urged us to conclude that <em>Strickland</em> applies to Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s claim only to the extent that he has alleged affirmative misadvice.  In the United States\xe2\x80\x99 view, \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel is not constitutionally required to provide advice on matters that will not be decided in the criminal case \xe2\x80\xa6 ,\xe2\x80\x9d though counsel is required to provide accurate advice if she chooses to discusses these matters.  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae </em>10.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent and Padilla both find the Solicitor General\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule unpersuasive, although it has support among the lower courts.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States </em>v. <em>Couto</em>, 311 F.\xc2\xa03d 179, 188 (CA2 2002); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Kwan</em>, 407 F.\xc2\xa03d 1005 (CA9 2005); <em>Sparks </em>v. <em>Sowders</em>, 852 F.\xc2\xa02d 882 (CA6 1988); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Russell</em>, 686 F.\xc2\xa02d 35 (CADC 1982); <em>State</em> v. <em>Rojas-Martinez</em>, 2005 UT 86, 125 P.\xc2\xa03d 930, 935; <em>In\xc2\xa0re Resendiz</em>, 25 Cal. 4th 230, 19 P.\xc2\xa03d 1171 (2001).  Kentucky describes these decisions isolating an affirmative misadvice claim as \xe2\x80\x9cresult-driven, incestuous \xe2\x80\xa6 [,and] completely lacking in legal or rational bases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 31.  We do not share that view, but we agree that there is no relevant difference \xe2\x80\x9cbetween an act of commission and an act of omission\xe2\x80\x9d in this context.  <em>Id.</em>, at 30; <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 690 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe court must then determine whether, in light of all the circumstances, the identified acts or omissions were outside the wide range of professionally competent assistance\xe2\x80\x9d); see also <em>State </em>v. <em>Paredez</em>, 2004\xe2\x80\x93NMSC\xe2\x80\x93036, 136 N.\xc2\xa0M. 533, 538\xe2\x80\x93539.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A holding limited to affirmative misadvice would invite two absurd results.  First, it would give counsel an incentive to remain silent on matters of great importance, even when answers are readily available.  Silence under these circumstances would be fundamentally at odds with the critical obligation of counsel to advise the client of \xe2\x80\x9cthe advantages and disadvantages of a plea agreement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Libretti</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/29/index.html">516 U. S. 29</a>, 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (1995).  When attorneys know that their clients face possible exile from this country and separation from their families, they should not be encouraged to say nothing at all.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Second, it would deny a class of clients least able to represent themselves the most rudimentary advice on deportation even when it is readily available.  It is quintessentially the duty of counsel to provide her client with available advice about an issue like deportation and the failure to do so \xe2\x80\x9cclearly satisfies the first prong of the <em>Strickland</em> analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Hill</em> v. <em>Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a>, 62 (1985) (White, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have given serious consideration to the concerns that the Solicitor General, respondent, and <em>amici </em>have stressed regarding the importance of protecting the finality of convictions obtained through guilty pleas.  We confronted a similar \xe2\x80\x9cfloodgates\xe2\x80\x9d concern in <em>Hill</em>, see<em> id.,</em> at 58, but nevertheless applied <em>Strickland</em> to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A flood did not follow in that decision\xe2\x80\x99s wake.  Surmounting <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x99s high bar is never an easy task.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 466 U. S., at 689 (\xe2\x80\x9cJudicial scrutiny of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance must be highly deferential\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 693 (observing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ttorney errors \xe2\x80\xa6 are as likely to be utterly harmless in a particular case as they are to be prejudicial\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, to obtain relief on this type of claim, a petitioner must convince the court that a decision to reject the plea bargain would have been rational under the circumstances.  See <em>Roe</em> v. <em>Flores-Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/470/index.html">528 U. S. 470</a>, 480, 486 (2000).  There is no reason to doubt that lower courts\xe2\x80\x94now quite experienced with applying <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x94can effectively and efficiently use its framework to separate specious claims from those with substantial merit.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It seems unlikely that our decision today will have a significant effect on those convictions already obtained as the result of plea bargains.  For at least the past 15 years, professional norms have generally imposed an obligation on counsel to provide advice on the deportation consequences of a client\xe2\x80\x99s plea.  See, <em>supra</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  We should, therefore, presume that counsel satisfied their obligation to render competent advice at the time their clients considered pleading guilty.  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 689.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Likewise, although we must be especially careful about recognizing new grounds for attacking the validity of guilty pleas, in the 25 years since we first applied <em>Strickland</em> to claims of ineffective assistance at the plea stage, practice has shown that pleas are less frequently the subject of collateral challenges than convictions obtained after a trial.  Pleas account for nearly 95% of all criminal convictions.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But they account for only approximately 30% of the habeas petitions filed.[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The nature of relief secured by a successful collateral challenge to a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x94an opportunity to withdraw the plea and proceed to trial\xe2\x80\x94imposes its own significant limiting principle: Those who collaterally attack their guilty pleas lose the benefit of the bargain obtained as a result of the plea.  Thus, a different calculus informs whether it is wise to challenge a guilty plea in a habeas proceeding because, ultimately, the challenge may result in a <em>less favorable</em> outcome for the defendant, whereas a collateral challenge to a conviction obtained after a jury trial has no similar downside potential.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, informed consideration of possible deportation can only benefit both the State and noncitizen defendants during the plea-bargaining process.  By bringing deportation consequences into this process, the defense and prosecution may well be able to reach agreements that better satisfy the interests of both parties.  As in this case, a criminal episode may provide the basis for multiple charges, of which only a subset mandate deportation following conviction.  Counsel who possess the most rudimentary understanding of the deportation consequences of a particular criminal offense may be able to plea bargain creatively with the prosecutor in order to craft a conviction and sentence that reduce the likelihood of deportation, as by avoiding a conviction for an offense that automatically triggers the removal consequence.  At the same time, the threat of deportation may provide the defendant with a powerful incentive to plead guilty to an offense that does not mandate that penalty in exchange for a dismissal of a charge that does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, we have long recognized that the negotiation of a plea bargain is a critical phase of litigation for purposes of the Sixth Amendment right to effective assistance of counsel.  <em>Hill</em>, 474 U.

S. 668</a> (1984), if the attorney misleads a noncitizen client regarding the removal consequences of a conviction.  In my view, such an attorney must (1) refrain from unreasonably providing incorrect advice and (2) advise the defendant that a criminal conviction may have adverse immigration consequences and that, if the alien wants advice on this issue, the alien should consult an immigration attorney.  I do not agree with the Court that the attorney must attempt to explain what those consequences may be.  As the Court concedes, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]mmigration law can be complex\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a legal specialty of its own\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9c[s]ome members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  The Court nevertheless holds that a criminal defense attorney must provide advice in this specialized area in those cases in which the law is \xe2\x80\x9csuccinct and straightforward\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94but not, perhaps, in other situations.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  This vague, halfway test will lead to much confusion and needless litigation.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under <em>Strickland</em>, an attorney provides ineffective assistance if the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s representation does not meet reasonable professional standards.  466 U. S., at 688.  Until today, the longstanding and unanimous position of the federal courts was that reasonable defense counsel generally need only advise a client about the <em>direct</em> consequences of a criminal conviction.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v<em>. Gonzalez</em>, 202 F. 3d 20, 28 (CA1 2000) (ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim fails if \xe2\x80\x9cbased on an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failure to advise a client of his plea\xe2\x80\x99s immigration consequences\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States </em>v.<em> Banda</em>, 1 F. 3d 354, 355 (CA5 1993) (holding that \xe2\x80\x9can attorney\xe2\x80\x99s failure to advise a client that deportation is a possible consequence of a guilty plea does not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d); see generally Chin &amp; Holmes, Effective Assistance of Counsel and the Consequences of Guilty Pleas, 87 Cornell L. Rev. 697, 699 (2002) (hereinafter Chin &amp; Holmes) (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually all jurisdictions\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9celeven federal circuits, more than thirty states, and the District of Columbia\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9chold that defense counsel need not discuss with their clients the collateral consequences of a conviction,\xe2\x80\x9d including deportation).  While the line between \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d consequences is not always clear, see <em>ante, </em>at 7, n.\xc2\xa08, the collateral-consequences rule expresses an important truth: Criminal defense attorneys have expertise regarding the conduct of criminal proceedings.  They are not expected to possess\xe2\x80\x94and very often do not possess\xe2\x80\x94expertise in other areas of the law, and it is unrealistic to expect them to provide expert advice on matters that lie outside their area of training and experience.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case happens to involve removal, but criminal convictions can carry a wide variety of consequences other than conviction and sentencing, including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits, ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or professional licenses.  Chin &amp; Holmes 705\xe2\x80\x93706.  A criminal conviction may also severely damage a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s reputation and thus impair the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s ability to obtain future employment or business opportunities.  All of those consequences are \xe2\x80\x9cseriou[s],\xe2\x80\x9d see<em> ante</em>, at 17, but this Court has never held that a criminal defense attorney\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment duties extend to providing advice about such matters.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court tries to justify its dramatic departure from precedent by pointing to the views of various professional organizations.  See<em> ante</em>, at 9 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe weight of prevailing professional norms supports the view that counsel must advise her client regarding the risk of deportation\xe2\x80\x9d).  However, ascertaining the level of professional competence required by the Sixth Amendment is ultimately a task for the courts.  <em>E.g.</em>,<em> Roe </em>v.<em> Flores-Ortega</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/470/index.html">528 U. S. 470</a>, 477 (2000).  Although we may appropriately consult standards promulgated by private bar groups, we cannot delegate to these groups our task of determining what the Constitution commands.  See<em> Strickland</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 688 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]revailing norms of practice as reflected in American Bar Association standards \xe2\x80\xa6 are guides to determining what is reasonable, but they are only guides\xe2\x80\x9d).  And we must recognize that such standards may represent only the aspirations of a bar group rather than an empirical assessment of actual practice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if the only relevant consideration were \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing professional norms,\xe2\x80\x9d it is hard to see how those norms can support the duty the Court today imposes on defense counsel.  Because many criminal defense attorneys have little understanding of immigration law, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, it should follow that a criminal defense attorney who refrains from providing immigration advice does not violate prevailing professional norms.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion would not just require defense counsel to warn the client of a general <em>risk</em> of removal; it would also require counsel in at least some cases, to specify what the removal <em>consequences</em> of a conviction would be.  See<em> ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s new approach is particularly problematic because providing advice on whether a conviction for a particular offense will make an alien removable is often quite complex.  \xe2\x80\x9cMost crimes affecting immigration status are not specifically mentioned by the [Immigration and Nationality Act (INA)], but instead fall under a broad category of crimes, such as <em>crimes involving moral turpitude </em>or <em>aggravated felonies</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  M. Garcia &amp; L. Eig, CRS Report for Congress, Immigration Consequences of Criminal Activity (Sept. 20, 2006) (summary) (emphasis in original).  As has been widely acknowledged, determining whether a particular crime is an \xe2\x80\x9caggravated felony\xe2\x80\x9d or a \xe2\x80\x9ccrime involving moral turpitude [(CIMT)]\xe2\x80\x9d is not an easy task.  See<em> </em>R. McWhirter, ABA, The Criminal Lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s Guide to Immigration Law:<em> </em>Questions and Answers<em> </em>128 (2d ed. 2006) (hereinafter ABA Guidebook) (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the increased complexity of aggravated felony law, this edition devotes a new [30-page] chapter to the subject\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., \xc2\xa75.2, at 146 (stating that the aggravated felony list at 8 U.

After a dizzying paragraph that attempts to explain the evolution of the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s view, the ABA Guidebook continues: \xe2\x80\x9cAdding to the confusion, however, is that the Ninth Circuit has conflicting opinions depending on the context on whether simple drug possession constitutes an aggravated felony under 8 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71101(a)(43).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>\xc2\xa75.35, at 161 (citing cases distinguishing between whether a simple possession offense is an aggravated felony \xe2\x80\x9cfor immigration purposes\xe2\x80\x9d or for \xe2\x80\x9csentencing purposes\xe2\x80\x9d).  The ABA Guidebook then proceeds to explain that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>attempted</em> possession,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>\xc2\xa75.36, at 161 (emphasis added), of a controlled substance <em>is</em> an aggravated felony, while \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onviction under the federal <em>accessory</em> after the fact statute is <em>probably</em> <em>not</em> an aggravated felony, but a conviction for accessory after the fact to the manufacture of methamphetamine <em>is</em> an aggravated felony,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, \xc2\xa7537, at 161 (emphasis added).  Conspiracy or attempt to commit drug trafficking are aggravated felonies, but \xe2\x80\x9c[s]olicitation is not a drug-trafficking offense because a generic solicitation offense is not an offense related to a controlled substance and therefore not an aggravated felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xa75.41, at 162.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Determining whether a particular crime is one involving moral turpitude is no easier.  See<em> id</em>., at 134 (\xe2\x80\x9cWriting bad checks <em>may or may not</em> be a CIMT\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]eckless assault coupled with an element of injury, but not serious injury, is <em>probably</em> not a CIMT\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>id</em>., at 135 (misdemeanor driving under the influence is generally not a CIMT, but may be a CIMT if the DUI results in injury or if the driver knew that his license had been suspended or revoked); <em>id</em>., at 136 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is no element of actual injury, the endangerment offense <em>may </em>not be a CIMT\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>ibid</em>. (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether [a child abuse] conviction involves moral turpitude <em>may</em> depend on the subsection under which the individual is convicted.  Child abuse done with criminal negligence <em>probably</em> is not a CIMT\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Many other terms of the INA are similarly ambiguous or may be confusing to practitioners not versed in the intricacies of immigration law.  To take just a few examples, it may be hard, in some cases, for defense counsel even to determine whether a client is an alien,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] or whether a particular state disposition will result in a \xe2\x80\x9cconviction\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of federal immigration law.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The task of offering advice about the immigration consequences of a criminal conviction is further complicated by other problems, including significant variations among Circuit interpretations of federal immigration statutes; the frequency with which immigration law changes; different rules governing the immigration consequences of juvenile, first-offender, and foreign convictions; and the relationship between the \xe2\x80\x9clength and type of sentence\xe2\x80\x9d and the determination \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [an alien] is subject to removal, eligible for relief from removal, or qualified to become a naturalized citizen,\xe2\x80\x9d Immigration Law and Crimes \xc2\xa72:1, at 2\xe2\x80\x932 to 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the professional organizations and guidebooks on which the Court so heavily relies are right to say that \xe2\x80\x9cnothing is ever simple with immigration law\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94including the determination whether immigration law clearly makes a particular offense removable.  ABA Guidebook \xc2\xa74.65, at 130; Immigration Law and Crimes \xc2\xa72:1.  I therefore cannot agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s apparent view that the Sixth Amendment requires criminal defense attorneys to provide immigration advice.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court tries to downplay the severity of the burden it imposes on defense counsel by suggesting that the scope of counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duty to offer advice concerning deportation consequences may turn on how hard it is to determine those consequences.  Where \xe2\x80\x9cthe terms of the relevant immigration statute are succinct, clear, and explicit in defining the removal consequence[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of a conviction, the Court says, counsel has an affirmative duty to advise the client that he will be subject to deportation as a result of the plea.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen the law is not succinct and straightforward \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, a criminal defense attorney need do no more than advise a noncitizen client that pending criminal charges may carry a risk of adverse immigration  consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.  This approach is problematic for at least four reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, it will not always be easy to tell whether a particular statutory provision is \xe2\x80\x9csuccinct, clear, and explicit.\xe2\x80\x9d  How can an attorney who lacks general immigration law expertise be sure that a seemingly clear statutory provision actually means what it seems to say when read in isolation?  What if the application of the provision to a particular case is not clear but a cursory examination of case law or administrative decisions would provide a definitive answer?  See Immigration Law and Crimes<em> </em>\xc2\xa72:1, at 2\xe2\x80\x932<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cUnfortunately, a practitioner or respondent cannot tell easily whether a conviction is for a removable offense\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [T]he cautious practitioner or apprehensive respondent will not know conclusively the future immigration consequences of a guilty plea\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, if defense counsel must provide advice regarding only one of the many collateral consequences of a criminal conviction, many defendants are likely to be misled.  To take just one example, a conviction for a particular offense may render an alien excludable but not removable.  If an alien charged with such an offense is advised only that pleading guilty to such an offense will not result in removal, the alien may be induced to enter a guilty plea without realizing that a consequence of the plea is that the alien will be unable to reenter the United States if the alien returns to his or her home country for any reason, such as to visit an elderly parent or to attend a funeral.  See<em> </em>ABA Guidebook \xc2\xa74.14, at 111 (\xe2\x80\x9cOften the alien is both <em>excludable </em>and <em>removable</em>.  At times, however, the lists are different.  Thus, the oddity of an alien that is inadmissible but not deportable.  This alien should not leave the United States because the government will not let him back in\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis in original)).  Incomplete legal advice may be worse than no advice at all because it may mislead and may dissuade the client from seeking advice from a more knowledgeable source.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rigid constitutional rule could inadvertently head off more promising ways of addressing the underlying problem\xe2\x80\x94such as statutory or administrative reforms requiring trial judges to inform a defendant on the record that a guilty plea may carry adverse immigration consequences.  As <em>amici</em> point out, \xe2\x80\x9c28 states and the District of Columbia have <em>already</em> adopted rules, plea forms, or statutes requiring courts to advise criminal defendants of the possible immigration consequences of their pleas.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State of Louisiana et\xc2\xa0al. 25; accord, Chin &amp; Holmes 708 (\xe2\x80\x9cA growing number of states require advice about deportation by statute or court rule\xe2\x80\x9d).  A nonconstitutional rule requiring trial judges to inform defendants on the record of the risk of adverse immigration consequences can ensure that a defendant receives needed information without putting a large number of criminal convictions at risk; and because such a warning would be given on the record, courts would not later have to determine whether the defendant was misrepresenting the advice of counsel.  Likewise, flexible statutory procedures for withdrawing guilty pleas might give courts appropriate discretion to determine whether the interests of justice would be served by allowing a particular defendant to withdraw a plea entered into on the basis of incomplete information.  Cf.<em> United States </em>v.<em> Russell</em>, 686 F.\xc2\xa02d 35, 39\xe2\x80\x9340 (CADC 1982) (explaining that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion to set aside a guilty plea under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be guided by, among other considerations, \xe2\x80\x9cthe possible existence of prejudice to the government\xe2\x80\x99s case as a result of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s untimely request to stand trial\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe strength of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s reason for withdrawing the plea, including whether the defendant asserts his innocence of the charge\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision marks a major upheaval in Sixth Amendment law.  This Court decided <em>Strickland</em> in 1984, but the majority does not cite a single case, from this or any other federal court, holding that criminal defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide advice concerning the removal consequences of a criminal conviction violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  As noted above, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view has been rejected by every Federal Court of Appeals to have considered the issue thus far.  See, <em>e.g.</em>,<em> Gonzalez</em>, 202 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 28; <em>Banda</em>, 1 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 355; Chin &amp; Holmes 697, 699.  The majority appropriately acknowledges that the lower courts are \xe2\x80\x9cnow quite experienced with applying <em>Strickland</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14, but it casually dismisses the longstanding and unanimous position of the lower federal courts with respect to the scope of criminal defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duty to advise on collateral consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority seeks to downplay its dramatic expansion of the scope of criminal defense counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duties under the Sixth Amendment by claiming that this Court in <em>Hill </em>v.<em> Lockhart</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/474/52/index.html">474 U. S. 52</a> (1985), similarly \xe2\x80\x9capplied <em>Strickland </em>to a claim that counsel had failed to advise the client regarding his parole eligibility before he pleaded guilty.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  That characterization of <em>Hill</em> obscures much more than it reveals.  The issue in <em>Hill </em>was whether a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated where counsel misinformed the client about his eligibility for parole.  The Court found it \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary to determine whether there may be circumstances under which erroneous advice by counsel as to parole eligibility may be deemed constitutionally ineffective assistance of counsel, because in the present case we conclude that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations are insufficient to satisfy the <em>Strickland </em>v. <em>Washington</em> requirement of \xe2\x80\x98prejudice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  474 U. S.,<em> </em>at 60.  Given that <em>Hill </em>expressly and unambiguously refused to decide whether criminal defense counsel must <em>avoid misinforming</em> his or her client as to <em>one</em> consequence of a criminal conviction (parole eligibility), that case plainly provides no support whatsoever for the proposition that counsel must <em>affirmatively</em> <em>advise</em> his or her client as to <em>another</em> collateral consequence (removal).  By the Court\xe2\x80\x99s strange logic, <em>Hill </em>would support its decision here even if the Court had held that misadvice concerning parole eligibility does <em>not</em> make counsel\xe2\x80\x99s performance objectively unreasonable.  After all, the Court still would have \xe2\x80\x9capplied <em>Strickland</em>\xe2\x80\x9d to the facts of the case at hand.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While mastery of immigration law is not required by <em>Strickland</em>, several considerations support the conclusion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal consequences of a conviction may constitute ineffective assistance.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, a rule prohibiting affirmative misadvice regarding a matter as crucial to the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea decision as deportation appears faithful to the scope and nature of the Sixth Amendment duty this Court has recognized in its past cases.  In particular, we have explained that \xe2\x80\x9ca guilty plea cannot be attacked as based on inadequate legal advice unless counsel was not \xe2\x80\x98a reasonably competent attorney\xe2\x80\x99 and the advice was not \xe2\x80\x98within the range of competence demanded of attorneys <em>in criminal cases</em>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 687<em> </em>(quoting <em>McMann</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/index.html">397 U. S. 759</a>, 770, 771 (1970); emphasis added).  As the Court appears to acknowledge, thorough understanding of the intricacies of immigration law is not \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the range of competence demanded of attorneys <em>in criminal cases</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  See<em> ante</em>, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9cImmigration law can be complex, and it is a legal specialty of its own.  Some members of the bar who represent clients facing criminal charges, in either state or federal court or both, may not be well versed in it\xe2\x80\x9d).  By contrast, reasonably competent attorneys should know that it is not appropriate or responsible to hold themselves out as authorities on a difficult and complicated subject matter with which they are not familiar.  Candor concerning the limits of one\xe2\x80\x99s professional expertise, in other words, is within the range of duties reasonably expected of defense attorneys in criminal cases.  As the dissenting judge on the Kentucky Supreme Court put it, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not believe it is too much of a burden to place on our defense bar the duty to say, \xe2\x80\x98I do not know.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  253 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 482, 485 (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, incompetent advice distorts the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s decisionmaking process and seems to call the fairness and integrity of the criminal proceeding itself into question.  See<em> Strickland</em>, 466 U. S., at 686 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn giving meaning to the requirement [of effective assistance of counsel], we must take its purpose\xe2\x80\x94to ensure a fair trial\xe2\x80\x94as the guide\xe2\x80\x9d).  When a defendant opts to plead guilty without definitive information concerning the likely effects of the plea, the defendant can fairly be said to assume the risk that the conviction may carry indirect consequences of which he or she is not aware.  That is not the case when a defendant bases the decision to plead guilty on counsel\xe2\x80\x99s express misrepresentation that the defendant will not be removable.  In the latter case, it seems hard to say that the plea was entered with the advice of constitutionally competent counsel\xe2\x80\x94or that it embodies a voluntary and intelligent decision to forsake constitutional rights.  See <em>ibid. </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cThe benchmark for judging any claim of ineffectiveness must be whether counsel\xe2\x80\x99s conduct so undermined the proper functioning of the adversarial process that the trial cannot be relied on as having produced a just result\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, a rule prohibiting unreasonable misadvice regarding exceptionally important collateral matters would not deter or interfere with ongoing political and administrative efforts to devise fair and reasonable solutions to the difficult problem posed by defendants who plead guilty without knowing of certain important collateral consequences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the conclusion that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal consequences of a conviction can give rise to ineffective assistance would, unlike the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach, not require any upheaval in the law.  As the Solicitor General points out, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he vast majority of the lower courts considering claims of ineffective assistance in the plea context have [distinguished] between defense counsel who remain silent and defense counsel who give affirmative misadvice.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as <em>Amicus</em> <em>Curiae</em> 8 (citing cases).  At least three Courts of Appeals have held that affirmative misadvice on immigration matters can give rise to ineffective assistance of counsel, at least in some circumstances.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  And several other Circuits have held that affirmative misadvice concerning nonimmigration consequences of a conviction can violate the Sixth Amendment even if those consequences might be deemed \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  By contrast, it appears that no court of appeals holds that affirmative misadvice concerning collateral consequences in general and removal in particular can <em>never</em> give rise to ineffective assistance.  In short, the considered and thus far unanimous view of the lower federal courts charged with administering <em>Strickland</em> clearly supports the conclusion that that Kentucky Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s position goes too far.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In concluding that affirmative misadvice regarding the removal consequences of a criminal conviction may constitute ineffective assistance, I do not mean to suggest that the Sixth Amendment does no more than require defense counsel to avoid misinformation.  When a criminal defense attorney is aware that a client is an alien, the attorney should advise the client that a criminal conviction may have adverse consequences under the immigration laws and that the client should consult an immigration specialist if the client wants advice on that subject.  By putting the client on notice of the danger of removal, such advice would significantly reduce the chance that the client would plead guilty under a mistaken premise.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, a criminal defense attorney should not be required to provide advice on immigration law, a complex specialty that generally lies outside the scope of a criminal defense attorney\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.  On the other hand, any competent criminal defense attorney should appreciate the extraordinary importance that the risk of removal might have in the client\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether to enter a guilty plea.  Accordingly, unreasonable and incorrect information concerning the risk of removal can give rise to an ineffectiveness claim.  In addition, silence alone is not enough to satisfy counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duty to assist the client.  Instead, an alien defendant\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment right to counsel is satisfied if defense counsel advises the client that a conviction may have immigration consequences, that immigration law is a specialized field, that the attorney is not an immigration lawyer, and that the client should consult an immigration specialist if the client wants advice on that subject.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Citizens are not deportable, but \xe2\x80\x9c[q]uestions of citizenship are not always simple.\xe2\x80\x9d  ABA Guidebook \xc2\xa74.20, at 113 (explaining that U.S. citizenship conferred by blood is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98derivative,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c[d]erivative citizenship depends on a number of confusing factors, including whether the citizen parent was the mother or father, the immigration laws in effect at the time of the parents\xe2\x80\x99 and/or defendant\xe2\x80\x99s birth, and the parents\xe2\x80\x99 marital status\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cA disposition that is not a \xe2\x80\x98conviction,\xe2\x80\x99 under state law may still be a \xe2\x80\x98conviction\xe2\x80\x99 for immigration purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>\xc2\xa74.32, at 117 (citing <em>Matter of Salazar</em>, 23 I.\xc2\xa0&amp;\xc2\xa0N.

The Constitution, however, is not an all-purpose tool for judicial construction of a perfect world; and when we ignore its text in order to make it that, we often find ourselves swinging a sledge where a tack hammer is needed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment guarantees the accused a lawyer \xe2\x80\x9cfor his defense\xe2\x80\x9d against a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not for sound advice about the collateral consequences of conviction.  For that reason, and for the practical reasons set forth in Part I of Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s concurrence, I dissent from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to provide accurate advice concerning the potential removal consequences of a guilty plea.  For the same reasons, but unlike the concurrence, I do not believe that affirmative misadvice about those consequences renders an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s assistance in defending against the prosecution constitutionally inadequate; or that the Sixth Amendment requires counsel to warn immigrant defendants that a conviction may render them removable.  Statutory provisions can remedy these concerns in a more targeted fashion, and without producing permanent, and legislatively irreparable, overkill.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sixth Amendment as originally understood and ratified meant only that a defendant had a right to employ counsel, or to use volunteered services of counsel.  See, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Van Duzee</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/140/169/index.html">140 U. S. 169</a>, 173 (1891); W. Beaney, Right to Counsel in American Courts 21, 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (1955).  We have held, however, that the Sixth Amendment requires the provision of counsel to indigent defendants at government expense, <em>Gideon</em> v. <em>Wainwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/335/index.html">372 U. S. 335</a>, 344\xe2\x80\x93345 (1963), and that the right to \xe2\x80\x9cthe assistance of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d includes the right to <em>effective</em> assistance, <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 686 (1984).  Even assuming the validity of these holdings, I reject the significant further extension that the Court, and to a lesser extent the concurrence, would create.  We have until today at least retained the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s textual limitation to criminal prosecutions.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]e have held that \xe2\x80\x98defence\xe2\x80\x99 means defense at trial, not defense in relation to other objectives that may be important to the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rothgery</em> v. <em>Gillespie County,</em> 554 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (Alito, J., concurring) (slip op., at 4) (summarizing cases).  We have limited the Sixth Amendment to legal advice directly related to defense against prosecution of the charged offense\xe2\x80\x94advice at trial, of course, but also advice at postindictment interrogations and lineups, <em>Massiah</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/377/201/index.html">377 U. S. 201</a>, 205\xe2\x80\x93206 (1964); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/index.html">388 U. S. 218</a>, 236\xe2\x80\x93238 (1967), and in general advice at all phases of the prosecution where the defendant would be at a disadvantage when pitted alone against the legally trained agents of the state, see <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 430 (1986).  Not only have we not required advice of counsel regarding consequences collateral to prosecution, we have not even required counsel appointed to defend against one prosecution to be present when the defendant is interrogated in connection with another possible prosecution arising from the same event.  <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Cobb</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/162/index.html">532 U. S. 162</a>, 164 (2001).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no basis in text or in principle to extend the constitutionally required advice regarding guilty pleas beyond those matters germane to the criminal prosecution at hand\xe2\x80\x94to wit, the sentence that the plea will produce, the higher sentence that conviction after trial might entail, and the chances of such a conviction.  Such matters fall within \xe2\x80\x9cthe range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>McMann</em> v. <em>Richardson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/759/index.html">397 U. S. 759</a>, 771 (1970).  See <em>id.,</em> at 769\xe2\x80\x93770 (describing the matters counsel and client must consider in connection with a contemplated guilty plea).  We have never held, as the logic of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion assumes, that once counsel is appointed all professional responsibilities of counsel\xe2\x80\x94even those extending beyond defense against the prosecution\xe2\x80\x94become constitutional commands.  Cf. <em>Cobb</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 171, n.\xc2\xa02;<em> Moran</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 430.  Because the subject of the misadvice here was not the prosecution for which Jose Padilla was entitled to effective assistance of counsel, the Sixth Amendment has no application.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adding to counsel\xe2\x80\x99s duties an obligation to advise about a conviction\xe2\x80\x99s collateral consequences has no logical stopping-point.  As the concurrence observes,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] criminal convictio[n] can carry a wide variety of consequences other than conviction and sentencing, including civil commitment, civil forfeiture, the loss of the right to vote, disqualification from public benefits, ineligibility to possess firearms, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, and loss of business or professional licenses. . . . All of those consequences are \xe2\x80\x98serious,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment).</p>\n<p align="left">\nBut it seems to me that the concurrence suffers from the same defect.  The same indeterminacy, the same inability to know what areas of advice are relevant, attaches to misadvice.  And the concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that counsel must warn defendants of potential removal consequences, see <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315\xe2\x80\x94what would come to be known as the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Padilla</em> warning\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94cannot be limited to those consequences except by judicial caprice.  It is difficult to believe that the warning requirement would not be extended, for example, to the risk of heightened sentences in later federal prosecutions pursuant to the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7924(e).  We could expect years of elaboration upon these new issues in the lower courts, prompted by the defense bar\xe2\x80\x99s devising of ever-expanding categories of plea-invalidating misadvice and failures to warn\xe2\x80\x94not to mention innumerable evidentiary hearings to determine whether misadvice really occurred or whether the warning was really given.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The concurrence\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of misadvice seems driven by concern about the voluntariness of Padilla\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea.  See <em>ante</em>, at 12.  But that concern properly relates to the Due Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, not to the Sixth Amendment.  See <em>McCarthy</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/459/index.html">394 U. S. 459</a>, 466 (1969); <em>Brady</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/742/index.html">397 U. S. 742</a>, 748 (1970).  Padilla has not argued before us that his guilty plea was not knowing and voluntary.  If that is, however, the true substance of his claim (and if he has properly preserved it) the state court can address it on remand.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  But we should not smuggle the claim into the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding prevents legislation that could solve the problems addressed by today\xe2\x80\x99s opinions in a more precise and targeted fashion.  If the subject had not been constitutionalized, legislation could specify which categories of misadvice about matters ancillary to the prosecution invalidate plea agreements, what collateral consequences counsel must bring to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s attention, and what warnings must be given.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Moreover, legislation could provide consequences for the misadvice, nonadvice, or failure to warn, other than nullification of a criminal conviction after the witnesses and evidence needed for retrial have disappeared.  Federal immigration law might provide, for example, that the near-automatic removal which follows from certain criminal convictions will not apply where the conviction rested upon a guilty plea induced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s misadvice regarding removal consequences.  Or legislation might put the government to a choice in such circumstances: Either retry the defendant or forgo the removal.  But all that has been precluded in favor of today\xe2\x80\x99s sledge hammer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Sixth Amendment guarantees adequate assistance of counsel in defending against a pending criminal prosecution.  We should limit both the constitutional obligation to provide advice and the consequences of bad advice to that well defined area.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0I do not mean to suggest that the Due Process Clause would surely provide relief.  We have indicated that awareness of \xe2\x80\x9cdirect consequences\xe2\x80\x9d suffices for the validity of a guilty plea.  See <em>Brady</em>, 397 U. S., at 755 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the required colloquy between a federal district court and a defendant required by Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b) (formerly Rule 11(c)), which we have said approximates the due process requirements for a valid plea, see <em>Libretti </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/516/29/index.html">516 U. S. 29</a>, 49\xe2\x80\x9350 (1995), does not mention collateral consequences.  Whatever the outcome, however, the effect of misadvice regarding such consequences upon the validity of a guilty plea should be analyzed under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0As the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion notes, <em>ante,</em> at 16\xe2\x80\x9317, n.\xc2\xa015, many States\xe2\x80\x94including Kentucky\xe2\x80\x94already require that criminal defendants be warned of potential removal consequences.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
