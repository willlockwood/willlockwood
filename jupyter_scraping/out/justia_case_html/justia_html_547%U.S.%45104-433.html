S. 258</a>, 268.  Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal) has stores in Queens and the Bronx.  Petitioner National Steel Supply, Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, has stores in the same locations and is Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s principal competitor.  Ideal filed suit in the District Court, claiming that National failed to charge New York\xe2\x80\x99s sales tax to cash-paying customers, allowing it to reduce its prices without affecting its profit margin; and that it submitted fraudulent state tax returns to conceal the conduct, which involved committing mail and wire fraud, both forms of \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d under RICO.  Ideal alleged that the Anzas violated \xc2\xa71962(c), which forbids conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  It also claimed that all the petitioners violated \xc2\xa71962(a)\xe2\x80\x94which makes it unlawful for a person \xe2\x80\x9cto use or invest\xe2\x80\x9d income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce\xe2\x80\x94when they used funds generated by the fraudulent tax scheme to open National\xe2\x80\x99s Bronx location, causing Ideal to lose business and market share.  The District Court granted petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6), concluding that Ideal had not shown reliance on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 misrepresentations, as required in RICO mail and wire fraud claims.  Vacating, the Second Circuit held, with regard to the \xc2\xa71962(c) claim, that a complaint alleging a pattern of racketeering activity designed to give a defendant a competitive advantage adequately pleaded probable cause even where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications made to a third party; and held that Ideal adequately pleaded its \xc2\xa71962(a) claim by alleging injury resulting from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 use and investment of racketeering proceeds. </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0Ideal cannot maintain its \xc2\xa71962(c) claim.  Under Holmes</em>,<em> </em>proximate cause for \xc2\xa71964(c) purposes requires \xe2\x80\x9csome direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 268.  The direct victim of the alleged RICO violation is the State of New York, not Ideal.  Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s claim is too attenuated to satisfy <em>Holmes</em>\xe2\x80\x99 requirement of directness.  This result is confirmed by the directness requirement\xe2\x80\x99s underlying premises, one of which is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.  Ideal claims lost sales because of National\xe2\x80\x99s decreased prices, but National could have lowered prices for reasons unrelated to the asserted tax fraud, and Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales could have resulted from other factors as well.  The attenuated connection between Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s injury and the Anzas\xe2\x80\x99 injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <em>Holmes.  </em>Further illustrating the absence of proximate cause is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.  A court would have to calculate the portion of National\xe2\x80\x99s price drop attributable to the pattern of racketeering activity and then calculate the portion of lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop, but <em>Holmes</em>\xe2\x80\x99 proximate causation element was meant to prevent such intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrunning RICO litigation.  A direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.  Contrary to the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s rationale, a RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to increase market share at a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s expense.  Because Ideal has not satisfied that requirement, this Court has no occasion to address the substantial question whether a plaintiff asserting a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud must show that it relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961\xe2\x80\x931968 (2000 ed. and Supp. III), prohibits certain conduct involving a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71962 (2000 ed.).  One of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement mechanisms is a private right of action, available to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive restrictions.  \xc2\xa71964(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html">503 U. S. 258</a>, 268 (1992), this Court held that a plaintiff may sue under \xc2\xa71964(c) only if the alleged RICO violation was the proximate cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  The instant case requires us to apply the principles discussed in <em>Holmes </em>to a dispute between two competing businesses.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because this case arises from a motion to dismiss, we accept as true the factual allegations in the amended complaint.  See <em>Leatherman</em> v. <em>Tarrant County Narcotics Intelligence and Coordination Unit,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/507/163/index.html">507 U. S. 163</a>, 164 (1993).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Ideal Steel Supply Corporation (Ideal)<em> </em>sells steel mill products along with related supplies and services.  It operates two store locations in New York, one in Queens and the other in the Bronx.  Petitioner National Steel Supply, Inc. (National), owned by petitioners Joseph and Vincent Anza, is Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s principal competitor.  National offers a similar array of products and services, and it, too, operates one store in Queens and one in the Bronx.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal sued petitioners in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.  It claimed petitioners were engaged in an unlawful racketeering scheme aimed at \xe2\x80\x9cgain[ing] sales and market share at Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 7.  According to Ideal, National adopted a practice of failing to charge the requisite New York sales tax to cash-paying customers, even when conducting transactions that were not exempt from sales tax under state law.  This practice allowed National to reduce its prices without affecting its profit margin.  Petitioners allegedly submitted fraudulent tax returns to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance in an effort to conceal their conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s amended complaint contains, as relevant here, two RICO claims.  The claims assert that petitioners, by submitting the fraudulent tax returns, committed various acts of mail fraud (when they sent the returns by mail) and wire fraud (when they sent them electronically).  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341, 1343 (2000 ed., Supp. III).  Mail fraud and wire fraud are forms of \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of RICO.  \xc2\xa71961(1)(B).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 conduct allegedly constituted a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa71961(5) (2000 ed.), because the fraudulent returns were submitted on an ongoing and regular basis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal asserts in its first cause of action that Joseph and Vincent Anza violated \xc2\xa71962(c), which makes it unlawful for \xe2\x80\x9cany person employed by or associated with any enterprise engaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce, to conduct or participate, directly or indirectly, in the conduct of such enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity or collection of unlawful debt.\xe2\x80\x9d  The complaint states that the Anzas\xe2\x80\x99 goal, which they achieved, was to give National a competitive advantage over Ideal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second cause of action is asserted against all three petitioners.  It alleges a violation of \xc2\xa71962(a), which makes it unlawful for any person who has received income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity \xe2\x80\x9cto use or invest\xe2\x80\x9d that income \xe2\x80\x9cin acquisition of any interest in, or the establishment or operation of,\xe2\x80\x9d an enterprise engaged in or affecting interstate or foreign commerce.  As described in the complaint, petitioners used funds generated by their fraudulent tax scheme to open National\xe2\x80\x99s Bronx location.  The opening of this new facility caused Ideal to lose \xe2\x80\x9csignificant business and market share.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 18.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners moved to dismiss Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s complaint under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 9(b).  The District Court granted the Rule 12(b)(6) motion, holding that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  The court began from the proposition that to assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud, a plaintiff must have relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations.  Ideal not having alleged that it relied on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 false tax returns, the court concluded Ideal could not go forward with its RICO claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal appealed, and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  373 F.\xc2\xa03d 251 (2004).  Addressing Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71962(c) claim, the court held that where a complaint alleges a pattern of racketeering activity \xe2\x80\x9cthat was intended to and did give the defendant a competitive advantage over the plaintiff, the complaint adequately pleads proximate cause, and the plaintiff has standing to pursue a civil RICO claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 263.  This is the case, the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9ceven where the scheme depended on fraudulent communications directed to and relied on by a third party rather than the plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The court reached the same conclusion with respect to Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71962(a) claim.  It reasoned that Ideal adequately pleaded its claim because it alleged an injury by reason of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 use and investment of racketeering proceeds, \xe2\x80\x9cas distinct from injury traceable simply to the predicate acts of racketeering alone or to the conduct of the business of the enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 264.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  546 U. S. __ (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis begins\xe2\x80\x94and, as will become evident, largely ends\xe2\x80\x94with <em>Holmes</em>.  That case arose from a complaint filed by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), a private corporation with a duty to reimburse the customers of registered broker-dealers who became unable to meet their financial obligations.  SIPC claimed that the petitioner, Robert Holmes, conspired with others to manipulate stock prices.  When the market detected the fraud, the share prices plummeted, and the \xe2\x80\x9cdecline caused [two] broker-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 financial difficulties resulting in their eventual liquidation and SIPC\xe2\x80\x99s advance of nearly $13 million to cover their customers\xe2\x80\x99 claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.  SIPC sued on several theories, including that Holmes participated in the conduct of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity in violation of \xc2\xa71962(c) and conspired to do so in violation of \xc2\xa71962(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held that SIPC could not maintain its RICO claims against Holmes for his alleged role in the scheme.  The decision relied on a careful interpretation of \xc2\xa71964(c), which provides a civil cause of action to persons injured \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s RICO violation.  The Court recognized the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d could be read broadly to require merely that the claimed violation was a \xe2\x80\x9cbut for\xe2\x80\x9d cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  <em>Id.</em>, at 265\xe2\x80\x93266.  It rejected this reading, however, noting the \xe2\x80\x9cunlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 266.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proper interpretation of \xc2\xa71964(c) required consideration of the statutory history, which revealed that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress modeled \xc2\xa71964(c) on the civil-action provision of the federal antitrust laws, \xc2\xa74 of the Clayton Act.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 267.  In <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Carpenters,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/index.html">459 U. S. 519</a> (1983), the Court held that \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to sue under \xc2\xa74 required a showing that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s violation not only was a \xe2\x80\x98but for\xe2\x80\x99 cause of his injury, but was the proximate cause as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 268 (citing <em>Associated Gen. Contractors</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 534).  This reasoning, the Court noted in <em>Holmes</em>, \xe2\x80\x9capplies just as readily to \xc2\xa71964(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 268.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Holmes </em>Court turned to the common-law foundations of the proximate-cause requirement, and specifically the \xe2\x80\x9cdemand for some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It concluded that even if SIPC were subrogated to the rights of certain aggrieved customers, the RICO claims could not satisfy this requirement of directness.  The deficiency, the Court explained, was that \xe2\x80\x9cthe link is too remote between the stock manipulation alleged and the customers\xe2\x80\x99 harm, being purely contingent on the harm suffered by the broker-dealers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 271.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the principles of <em>Holmes </em>to the present case, we conclude Ideal cannot maintain its claim based on \xc2\xa71962(c).  Section 1962(c), as noted above, forbids conducting or participating in the conduct of an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  The Court has indicated the compensable injury flowing from a violation of that provision \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern, for the essence of the violation is the commission of those acts in connection with the conduct of an enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</em> v. <em>Imrex Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/index.html">473 U. S. 479</a>, 497 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s theory is that Joseph and Vincent Anza harmed it by defrauding the New York tax authority and using the proceeds from the fraud to offer lower prices designed to attract more customers.  The RICO violation alleged by Ideal is that the Anzas conducted National\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of mail fraud and wire fraud.  The direct victim of this conduct was the State of New York, not Ideal.  It was the State that was being defrauded and the State that lost tax revenue as a result.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The proper referent of the proximate-cause<em> </em>analysis is an alleged practice of conducting National\xe2\x80\x99s business through a pattern of defrauding the State.  To be sure, Ideal asserts it suffered its own harms when the Anzas failed to charge customers for the applicable sales tax.  The cause of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s asserted harms, however, is a set of actions (offering lower prices) entirely distinct from the alleged RICO violation (defrauding the State).  The attenuation between the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s harms and the claimed RICO violation arises from a different source in this case than in <em>Holmes</em>, where the alleged violations were linked to the asserted harms only through the broker-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 inability to meet their financial obligations.  Nevertheless, the absence of proximate causation is equally clear in both cases.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This conclusion is confirmed by considering the directness requirement\xe2\x80\x99s underlying premises.  See 503 U. S., at 269\xe2\x80\x93270.  One motivating principle is the difficulty that can arise when a court attempts to ascertain the damages caused by some remote action.  See <em>id.</em>, at 269 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors\xe2\x80\x9d).  The instant case is illustrative.  The injury Ideal alleges is its own loss of sales resulting from National\xe2\x80\x99s decreased prices for cash-paying customers.  National, however, could have lowered its prices for any number of reasons unconnected to the asserted pattern of fraud.  It may have received a cash inflow from some other source or concluded that the additional sales would justify a smaller profit margin.  Its lowering of prices in no sense required it to defraud the state tax authority.  Likewise, the fact that a company commits tax fraud does not mean the company will lower its prices; the additional cash could go anywhere from asset acquisition to research and development to dividend payouts.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 271 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe broker-dealers simply cannot pay their bills, and only that intervening insolvency connects the conspirators\xe2\x80\x99 acts to the losses suffered by the nonpurchasing customers and general creditors\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, in addition, a second discontinuity between the RICO violation and the asserted injury.  Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged acts of fraud.  Businesses lose and gain customers for many reasons, and it would require a complex assessment to establish what portion of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales were the product of National\xe2\x80\x99s decreased prices.  Cf. <em>id.</em>, at 272\xe2\x80\x93273 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the nonpurchasing customers were allowed to sue, the district court would first need to determine the extent to which their inability to collect from the broker-dealers was the result of the alleged conspiracy to manipulate, as opposed to, say, the broker-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 poor business practices or their failures to anticipate developments in the financial markets\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attenuated connection between Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s injury and the Anzas\xe2\x80\x99 injurious conduct thus implicates fundamental concerns expressed in <em>Holmes</em>.  Notwithstanding the lack of any appreciable risk of duplicative recoveries, which is another consideration relevant to the proximate-cause inquiry, see <em>id.</em>, at 269, these concerns help to illustrate why Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s alleged injury was not the direct result of a RICO violation.  Further illustrating this point is the speculative nature of the proceedings that would follow if Ideal were permitted to maintain its claim.  A court considering the claim would need to begin by calculating the portion of National\xe2\x80\x99s price drop attributable to the alleged pattern of racketeering activity.  It next would have to calculate the portion of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales attributable to the relevant part of the price drop.  The element of proximate causation recognized in <em>Holmes </em>is meant to prevent these types of intricate, uncertain inquiries from overrunning RICO litigation.  It has particular resonance when applied to claims brought by economic competitors, which, if left unchecked, could blur the line between RICO and the antitrust laws.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.  See <em>id.</em>, at 269\xe2\x80\x93270 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]irectly injured victims can generally be counted on to vindicate the law as private attorneys general, without any of the problems attendant upon suits by plaintiffs injured more remotely\xe2\x80\x9d).  Again, the instant case is instructive.  Ideal accuses the Anzas of defrauding the State of New York out of a substantial amount of money.  If the allegations are true, the State can be expected to pursue appropriate remedies.  The adjudication of the State\xe2\x80\x99s claims, moreover, would be relatively straightforward; while it may be difficult to determine facts such as the number of sales Ideal lost due to National\xe2\x80\x99s tax practices, it is considerably easier to make the initial calculation of how much tax revenue the Anzas withheld from the State.  There is no need to broaden the universe of actionable harms to permit RICO suits by parties who have been injured only indirectly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals reached a contrary conclusion, apparently reasoning that because the Anzas allegedly sought to gain a competitive advantage over Ideal, it is immaterial whether they took an indirect route to accomplish their goal.  See 373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 263.  This rationale does not accord with <em>Holmes</em>.  A RICO plaintiff cannot circumvent the proximate-cause requirement simply by claiming that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s aim was to increase market share at a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s expense.  See <em>Associated Gen. Contractors</em>, 459 U. S., at 537 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe are also satisfied that an allegation of improper motive . . . is not a panacea that will enable any complaint to withstand a motion to dismiss\xe2\x80\x9d).  When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the central question it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injuries.  In the instant case, the answer is no.  We hold that Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71962(c) claim does not satisfy the requirement of proximate causation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners alternatively ask us to hold, in line with the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision granting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss, that a plaintiff may not assert a RICO claim predicated on mail fraud or wire fraud unless it demonstrates it relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentations.  They argue that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action must be interpreted in light of common-law principles, and that at common law a fraud action requires the plaintiff to prove reliance.  Because Ideal has not satisfied the proximate-cause requirement articulated in <em>Holmes</em>, we have no occasion to address the substantial question whether a showing of reliance is required.

(Petitioners also contend that \xe2\x80\x9ca civil RICO plaintiff does not plead an injury proximately caused by a violation of \xc2\xa71962(a) merely by alleging that a corporate defendant reinvested profits back into itself,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioners 20, n.\xc2\xa05, but this argument has not been developed, and we decline to address it.)  It is true that private actions for violations of \xc2\xa71962(a), like actions for violations of \xc2\xa71962(c), must be asserted under \xc2\xa71964(c).  It likewise is true that a claim is cognizable under \xc2\xa71964(c) only if the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s alleged violation proximately caused the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  The proximate-cause inquiry, however, requires careful consideration of the \xe2\x80\x9crelation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 268.  Because \xc2\xa71962(c) and \xc2\xa71962(a) set forth distinct prohibitions, it is at least debatable whether Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s two claims should be analyzed in an identical fashion for proximate-cause purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held that Ideal adequately pleaded its \xc2\xa71962(a) claim, see 373 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 264, but the court did not address proximate causation.  We decline to consider Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71962(a) claim without the benefit of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 analysis, particularly given that the parties have devoted nearly all their attention in this Court to the \xc2\xa71962(c) claim.  We therefore vacate the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment with respect to Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa71962(a) claim.

(2000 ed. and Supp. III), by adopting a theory of proximate causation that is supported neither by the Act nor by our decision in <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html">503 U.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s stringent proximate-causation requirement succeeds in precluding recovery in cases alleging a violation of \xc2\xa71962(c) that, like the present one, have nothing to do with organized crime, the target of the RICO statute.  However, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach also eliminates recovery for plaintiffs whose injuries are precisely those that Congress aimed to remedy through the authorization of civil RICO suits.  Because this frustration of congressional intent is directly contrary to the broad language Congress employed to confer a RICO cause of action, I respectfully dissent from Part II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The language of the civil RICO provision, which broadly permits recovery by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\xe2\x80\x9d of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantive restrictions, \xc2\xa71964(c) (2000 ed.), plainly covers the lawsuit brought by respondent.

S., at 268\xe2\x80\x93269.  The plaintiff in <em>Holmes</em> was indirect in precisely this sense.  The defendant was alleged to have participated in a stock manipulation scheme that disabled two broker-dealers from meeting their obligations to customers.  Accordingly, the plaintiff, Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC), had to advance nearly $13 million to cover the claims of customers of those broker-dealers.  SIPC attempted to sue based on the claim that it was subrogated to the rights of those customers of the broker-dealers who did not purchase manipulated securities.  We held that the nonpurchasing customers\xe2\x80\x99 injury was not proximately caused by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, because \xe2\x80\x9cthe conspirators have allegedly injured these customers only insofar as the stock manipulation first injured the broker-dealers and left them without the wherewithal to pay customers\xe2\x80\x99 claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 271.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, in contrast, it was not <em>New York\xe2\x80\x99s</em> <em>injury</em> that caused respondent\xe2\x80\x99s damages; rather, it was petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 own conduct\xe2\x80\x94namely, their underpayment of tax\xe2\x80\x94that permitted them to undercut respondent\xe2\x80\x99s prices and thereby take away its business.  Indeed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s acknowledgment that there is no appreciable risk of duplicative recovery here, in contrast to <em>Holmes</em>, <em>ante, </em>at 7, is effectively a concession that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 damages are not indirect, as that term is used in <em>Holmes</em>.  See 503 U. S.,  at 269 (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]ecognizing claims of the indirectly injured would force courts to adopt complicated rules apportioning damages among plaintiffs removed at different levels of injury from the violative acts, to obviate the risk of multiple recoveries\xe2\x80\x9d).  The mere fact that New York is a direct victim of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 RICO violation does not preclude Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s claim that it too is a direct victim.  Because the petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 tax underpayment directly caused respondent\xe2\x80\x99s injury, <em>Holmes </em>does not bar respondent\xe2\x80\x99s recovery.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless contends that respondent has failed to demonstrate proximate cause.  It does so by relying on our observation in <em>Holmes </em>that the directness requirement is appropriate because \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he less direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to ascertain the amount of a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s damages attributable to the violation, as distinct from other, independent, factors.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6 (quoting <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 269, in turn, citing <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Carpenters</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/index.html">459 U. S. 519</a> (1983)).  In <em>Holmes</em>, we noted that it would be hard for the District Court to determine how much of the broker-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 failure to pay their customers was due to the fraud and how much was due to other factors affecting the broker-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 business success.  503 U. S., at 273\xe2\x80\x93274.  The Court contends that here, as in <em>Holmes</em>, it is difficult to \xe2\x80\x9cascertain the damages caused by some remote action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on the difficulty of ascertaining the amount of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s damages caused by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 unlawful acts to label those damages indirect is misguided.  <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Associated General Contractors</em> simply held that one reason that <em>indirect </em>injuries should not be compensable is that such injuries are difficult to ascertain.  <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 269; <em>Associated General Contractors, supra</em>, at 542. <em> </em>We did not adopt the converse proposition that any<em> </em>injuries that are difficult to ascertain must be classified as indirect<em> </em>for purposes of determining proximate causation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Proximate cause and certainty of damages, while both related to the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to prove that the amount of damages he seeks is fairly attributable to the defendant, are distinct requirements for recovery in tort.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  See 4 Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7912 (1977) (certainty of damages); 2 <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7430\xe2\x80\x93431 (1963\xe2\x80\x931964) (proximate causation).<em> </em>That is, to recover, a plaintiff must show <em>both</em> that his injury is sufficiently connected to the tort that \xe2\x80\x9cthe moral judgment and practical sense of mankind [will] recognize responsibility in the domain of morals,\xe2\x80\x9d Sutherland 18, and that the specific pecuniary advantages, the loss of which is alleged as damages, \xe2\x80\x9cwould have resulted, and, therefore, that the act complained of prevented them,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 106\xe2\x80\x93107.  <em>Holmes </em>and <em>Associated General Contractors </em>dealt primarily with the former showing.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the Union\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chighly speculative\xe2\x80\x9d damages in <em>Associated General Contractors </em>focused not on the difficulty of proving the precise amount of damages, but with \xe2\x80\x9cthe tenuous and speculative character of the relationship between the alleged antitrust violation and the Union\xe2\x80\x99s alleged injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  459 U. S., at 545.<em> </em>Here, the relationship between the alleged RICO violation and the alleged injury is clear: Petitioners underpaid sales tax, permitting them to undercharge sales tax, inflicting competitive injury on respondent.  The question with which the Court expresses concern\xe2\x80\x94whether Ideal can prove the amount of its actual damages \xe2\x80\x9cwith sufficient certainty,\xe2\x80\x9d Sutherland 106, to permit recovery\xe2\x80\x94is simply not before the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is nonetheless worth noting that the Court overstates the difficulties of proof faced by respondent in this case.  Certainly the plaintiff in this case, as in all tort cases involving damage to business, must demonstrate that he suffered a harm caused by the tort, and not merely by external market conditions.  See generally Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa7130, at 1014\xe2\x80\x931015, and nn. 92\xe2\x80\x9399 (gathering cases authorizing liability for torts that \xe2\x80\x9cdepriv[e] the plaintiff of customers or other prospects\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Dura Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</em> v. <em>Broudo, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/544/336/index.html">544 U. S. 336</a>, 342 (2005) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n inflated purchase price will not itself constitute or proximately cause the relevant economic loss,\xe2\x80\x9d absent evidence that it was the inflated price that actually caused harm).<em> </em>But under the facts as alleged by Ideal, National did not generally lower its prices, so the Court need not inquire into \xe2\x80\x9cany number of reasons,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, that it might have done so.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  Instead, it simply <em>ceased charging tax </em>on cash sales, allegedly, and logically, because it had ceased reporting those sales and accordingly was not itself paying sales tax on them.  App. 11\xe2\x80\x9313.  Nor is it fatal to Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s proof of damages that National could have continued to charge taxes to its customers and invested the additional money elsewhere.  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  Had National actually done so, it might be difficult to ascertain the damages suffered by Ideal as a result of that investment.  But the mere fact that National <em>could have </em>committed tax fraud without readily ascertainable injury to Ideal does not mean that its tax fraud <em>necessarily </em>caused no readily ascertainable injury in this case.  Likewise, the Court is undoubtedly correct that \xe2\x80\x9cIdeal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales could have resulted from factors other than petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 alleged tax frauds.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  However, the means through which the fraudulent scheme was carried out\xe2\x80\x94with sales tax charged on noncash sales, but no tax charged on cash sales\xe2\x80\x94renders the damages more ascertainable than in the typical case of lost business.  In any event, it is well within the expertise of a district court to evaluate testimony and evidence and determine what portion of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s lost sales are attributable to National\xe2\x80\x99s lower prices and what portion to other factors.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court also relies on an additional reason <em>Holmes </em>gave for limiting recovery to direct victims\xe2\x80\x94namely, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he requirement of a direct causal connection is especially warranted where the immediate victims of an alleged RICO violation can be expected to vindicate the laws by pursuing their own claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (citing <em>Holmes</em>, 503 U. S., at 269\xe2\x80\x93270).<em> </em> Certainly, New York can sue here and vindicate the law, rendering respondent\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement of the law less necessary than it would be if respondent were the only direct victim of the illegal activity.  But our recognition in <em>Holmes </em>that limiting recovery to direct victims would not undermine deterrence does not support the conclusion that any victim whose lawsuit is unnecessary for deterrence is an indirect victim.  Indeed, in any tort case with multiple possible plaintiffs, a single plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit could suffice to vindicate the law.  If multiple plaintiffs are direct victims of a tort, it would be unjust to declare some of their lawsuits unnecessary for deterrence, absent any basis for doing so in the relevant statute.  Because respondent\xe2\x80\x99s injuries result from petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 fraud, and not from New York\xe2\x80\x99s injuries, respondent has a right to recover equal to that of New York.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Application of common-law principles of proximate causation beyond the directness requirement likewise supports a finding that causation was sufficiently pleaded in this case.

The Court, in contrast, permits a defendant to evade liability for harms that are not only foreseeable, but the <em>intended</em> consequences of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unlawful behavior.  A defendant may do so simply by concocting a scheme under which a further, lawful and intentional step <em>by the defendant </em>is required to inflict the injury.  Such a rule precludes recovery for injuries for which the defendant is plainly morally responsible and which are suffered by easily identifiable plaintiffs.

See <em>Sedima</em>, 473 U.

Given the distance the facts of this case lie from the prototypical organized criminal activity that led to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, it is tempting to find in the Act a limitation that will keep at least this and similar cases out of court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to exclude this case from the reach of civil RICO, however, succeeds in eliminating not only cases that lie far outside the harm RICO was intended to correct, but also those that were at the core of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 concern in enacting the statute.  The Court unanimously recognized in <em>Sedima</em> that one reason\xe2\x80\x94and, for the dissent, the principal reason\xe2\x80\x94Congress enacted RICO was to protect businesses against competitive injury from organized crime.  See <em>id.</em>, at 500\xe2\x80\x93523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (concluding that the provision conferring a right of action on individual plaintiffs had as its \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal target \xe2\x80\xa6 the economic power of racketeers, and its toll on legitimate businessmen\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id</em>., at 494\xe2\x80\x93500.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The unanimous view of the <em>Sedima </em>Court is correct.  The sponsor of a Senate precursor to RICO noted that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>the</em> evil to be curbed is the unfair competitive advantage inherent in the large amount of illicit income available to organized crime.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 514 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong.

This bill fills that gap.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 516 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 115 Cong. Rec. 6993 (1969); emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nA portion of these bills was ultimately included in RICO, which was attached as Title IX to the Organized Crime Control Act.  The Committee Report noted that the Title \xe2\x80\x9chas as its purpose the elimination of the infiltration of organized crime and racketeering into legitimate organizations operating in interstate commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x93617, p. 76 (1969).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The observations of the President\xe2\x80\x99s Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice, the source of much of the congressional concern over organized crime, are consistent with these statements.  Its chapter on Organized Crime noted that \xe2\x80\x9corganized crime is also extensively and deeply involved in legitimate business\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [I]t employs illegitimate methods\xe2\x80\x94monopolization, terrorism, extortion, tax evasion\xe2\x80\x94to drive out or control lawful ownership and leadership and to exact illegal profits from the public.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Challenge of Crime in a Free Society, p.\xc2\xa0187 (1967).  The report noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he millions of dollars [organized crime] can throw into the legitimate economic system gives it power to manipulate the price of shares on the stock market, to raise or lower the price of retail merchandise, to determine whether entire industries are union or nonunion, to make it easier or harder for businessmen to continue in business.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not difficult to imagine a competitive injury to a business that would result from the kind of organized crime that <em>Sedima</em>, Congress, and the Commission all recognized as the principal concern of RICO, yet that would fail the Court\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive proximate-cause test.  For example, an organized crime group, running a legitimate business, could, through threats of violence, persuade its supplier to sell goods to it at cost, so that it could resell those goods at a lower price to drive its competitor out of the business.  Honest businessmen would be unable to compete, as they do not engage in threats of violence to lower their costs.  Civil RICO, if it was intended to do anything at all, was intended to give those businessmen a cause of action.  Cf. Sedima, 473 U. S., at 521\xe2\x80\x93522 (Marshall, J., dissenting).<em> </em>Yet just like respondent, those businessmen would not themselves be the immediate target of the threats; the target would be the supplier.  Like respondent\xe2\x80\x99s injury, their injury would be most immediately caused by the lawful activity of price competition, not the unlawful activity of threatening the supplier.  Accordingly, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the honest businessman competitor would be just an \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d victim, whose injury was not proximately caused by the RICO violation.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Civil RICO would thus confer no right to sue on the individual who did not himself suffer the threats of violence, even if the threats caused him harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a result, after today, civil RICO plaintiffs that suffer precisely the kind of injury that motivated the adoption of the civil RICO provision will be unable to obtain relief.  If this result was compelled by the text of the statute, the interference with congressional intent would be unavoidable.  Given that the language is not even fairly susceptible of such a reading, however, I cannot agree with this frustration of congressional intent.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because I conclude that Ideal has sufficiently pleaded proximate cause, I must proceed to the question which the Court does not reach: whether reliance is a required element of a RICO claim predicated on mail or wire fraud and, if it is, whether that reliance must be by the plaintiff.  The Court of Appeals held that reliance is required, but that \xe2\x80\x9ca RICO claim based on mail fraud may be proven where the misrepresentations were relied on by a third person, rather than by the plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  373 F.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.  I disagree with the conclusion that reliance is required at all.  In my view, the mere fact that the predicate acts underlying a particular RICO violation happen to be fraud offenses does not mean that reliance, an element of common-law fraud, is also incorporated as an element of a civil RICO claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners are correct that the common law generally required a showing of justifiable reliance before a plaintiff could recover for damages caused by fraud.  See <em>Neder</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/1/index.html">527 U. S. 1</a>, 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (1999); Prosser &amp; Keeton \xc2\xa7105, at 728.  But RICO does not confer on private plaintiffs a right to sue defendants who engage in any act of common-law fraud; instead, racketeering activity includes, as relevant to this case, \xe2\x80\x9cany act which is indictable under [18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7]1341 (relating to mail fraud) [and \xc2\xa7]1343 (relating to wire fraud).\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III).  And we have recognized that these criminal fraud statutes \xe2\x80\x9cdid not incorporate <em>all</em> the elements of common-law fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Neder</em>, 527 U. S., at 24.  Instead, the criminal mail fraud statute applies to anyone who \xe2\x80\x9chaving devised or intending to devise any scheme or artifice to defraud\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 for the purpose of executing such scheme or artifice or attempting so to do, places in any post office\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 any matter or thing whatever to be sent or delivered by the Postal Service\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71341.  See \xc2\xa71343 (similar language for wire fraud).  We have specifically noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[b]y prohibiting the \xe2\x80\x98scheme to defraud,\xe2\x80\x99 rather than the completed fraud, the element of reliance\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 would clearly be inconsistent with the statutes Congress enacted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 25.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because an individual can commit an indictable act of mail or wire fraud even if no one relies on his fraud, he can engage in a pattern of racketeering activity, in violation of \xc2\xa71962, without proof of reliance.  Accordingly, it cannot be disputed that the Government could prosecute a person for such behavior.  The terms of \xc2\xa71964(c) (2000 ed.), which broadly authorize suit by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962,\xe2\x80\x9d permit no different conclusion when an individual brings a civil action against such a RICO violator.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that our decision in <em>Holmes </em>to apply the common-law proximate cause requirement was likewise not compelled by the broad language of the statute.  But our decision in that case was justified by the \xe2\x80\x9cvery unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow all factually injured plaintiffs to recover.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 266. <em> </em>This unlikelihood stems, in part, from the nature of proximate cause, which is \xe2\x80\x9cnot only a general condition of civil liability at common law but is almost essential to shape and delimit a rational remedy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Systems Management, Inc.</em> v. <em>Loiselle</em>, 303 F.\xc2\xa03d 100, 104 (CA1 2002).  We also decided <em>Holmes </em>in light of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to use the same words to impose civil liability under RICO as it had in \xc2\xa77 of the Sherman Act, 26 Stat. 210, into which federal courts had implied a proximate-cause limitation.  503 U. S.<em>,</em> at 268. <em> </em>Accordingly, it was fair to interpret the broad language \xe2\x80\x9cby reason of\xe2\x80\x9d as meaning, in all civil RICO cases, that the violation must be both the cause-in-fact and the proximate cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, by contrast, the civil action provision cannot be read to always require that the plaintiff have relied on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s action.  Reliance is not a general limitation on civil recovery in tort; it \xe2\x80\x9cis a specialized condition that happens to have grown up with common law fraud.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Loiselle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 104.<em> </em>For most of the predicate acts underlying RICO violations, it cannot be argued that the common law, if it even recognized such acts as civilly actionable, required proof of reliance.  See \xc2\xa71961 (2000 ed., Supp. III).  In other words, there is no language in \xc2\xa71964(c) that could fairly be read to add a reliance requirement in fraud cases only.  Nor is there any reason to believe that Congress would have defined \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d to include acts indictable under the mail and wire fraud statutes, if it intended fraud-related acts to be predicate acts under RICO only when those acts would have been actionable under the common law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because reliance cannot be read into \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71341 and 1343, nor into RICO itself, it is not an element of a civil RICO claim.  This is not to say that, in the general case, a plaintiff will not have to prove that someone relied on the predicate act of fraud as part of his case.  If, for example, New York had not believed petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 misrepresentation with respect to their sales, Ideal may well not have been injured by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 scheme, which would have faltered at the first step.  Indeed, the petitioners recognize that \xe2\x80\x9cin the ordinary misrepresentation case, the reliance requirement simply functions as a necessary prerequisite to establishing the causation required by the language of \xc2\xa71964(c).\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 29.  But the fact that proof of reliance is often used to prove an element of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action, such as the element of causation, does not transform reliance itself into an element of the cause of action.  See <em>Loiselle,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 104 (\xe2\x80\x9cReliance is doubtless the most obvious way in which fraud can cause harm, but it is not the only way\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because respondent need not allege reliance at all, its complaint, which alleges that New York relied on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 misrepresentations, App. 16, is more than sufficient.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Congress that enacted RICO may never have intended to reach cases like the one before us, and may have \xe2\x80\x9cfederalize[d] a great deal of state common law\xe2\x80\x9d without any intention of \xe2\x80\x9cproduc[ing] these far-reaching results.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sedima</em>, 473 U.

But this Court has always refused to ignore the language of the statute to limit it to \xe2\x80\x9cthe archetypal, intimidating mobster,\xe2\x80\x9d and has instead recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is not for the judiciary to eliminate the private action in situations where Congress has provided it simply because plaintiffs are not taking advantage of it in its more difficult applications.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 499\xe2\x80\x93500.  Today, however, the Court not only eliminates private RICO actions in some situations Congress may have inadvertently regulated, but it substantially limits the ability of civil RICO to reach even those cases that motivated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 enactment of this provision in the first place.

See 1 J. Sutherland, Law of Damages 55 (1882) (hereinafter Sutherland).

I believe that this is such a case and would consequently hold that RICO does not authorize the private action here at issue.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RICO essentially seeks to prevent organized criminals from taking over or operating legitimate businesses.  Its language, however, extends its scope well beyond those central purposes.  RICO begins by listing certain predicate acts, called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98racketeering activity,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which consist of other crimes, ranging from criminal copyright activities, the facilitation of gambling, and mail fraud to arson, kidnapping and murder.  \xc2\xa71961(1).  It then defines a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98pattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to include engaging in \xe2\x80\x9cat least two\xe2\x80\x9d predicate acts in a 10-year period. \xc2\xa71961(5) (2000 ed.).  And it forbids certain business-related activities involving such a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern\xe2\x80\x9d and an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  The forbidden activities include using funds derived from a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d in acquiring, establishing, or operating any enterprise, and conducting the affairs of any enterprise through such \xe2\x80\x9ca pattern.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(a), (c).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0RICO, a federal criminal statute, foresees criminal law enforcement by the Federal Government.  \xc2\xa71963 (2000 ed., Supp. III).

A steel supply company, Ideal Steel, has sued a competing steel supply company, National Steel, and its owners, Joseph and Vincent Anza (to whom I shall refer collectively as \xe2\x80\x9cNational\xe2\x80\x9d).  Ideal says that National committed mail fraud by regularly filing false New York state sales tax returns in order to avoid paying sales tax that it owed\xe2\x80\x94activity that amounts to a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  This activity enabled National to charge lower prices without reducing its profit margins.  Ideal says National used some of these excess profits to fund the building of a new store.  Both the lower prices and the new outlet attracted Ideal customers, thereby injuring Ideal.  Hence, says Ideal, it was injured \xe2\x80\x9cin [its] business \xe2\x80\xa6 by reason of\xe2\x80\x9d violations of two RICO provisions, the provision that forbids conducting an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs\xe2\x80\x9d through a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d and the provision that forbids investing funds derived from such a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern\xe2\x80\x9d in an \xe2\x80\x9centerprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(c), (a).  The question before us is whether RICO permits Ideal to bring this private treble-damages claim.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court, in <em>Holmes</em> v. <em>Securities Investor Protection Corporation,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/503/258/index.html">503 U. S. 258</a>, 268 (1992), held that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private treble-damages provision \xe2\x80\x9cdemand[ed] . . . some direct relation between the injury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court then determined that the injury alleged by the plaintiff in that case was too remote from the injurious conduct to satisfy this requirement.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not agree with the majority insofar as it believes that <em>Holmes\xe2\x80\x99 </em>holding in respect to the fact pattern there at issue virtually dictates the answer to the question here.  In my view, the \xe2\x80\x9ccausal connection\xe2\x80\x9d between the forbidden conduct and plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s harm is, in certain key ways, more direct here than it was in <em>Holmes</em>.<em> </em>In <em>Holmes,</em> the RICO plaintiff was a surrogate for creditors of broker-dealers that went bankrupt after losing money in stocks that had been overvalued due to fraudulent statements made by the RICO defendant and others.  Put in terms of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause,\xe2\x80\x9d the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s harm (an ordinary creditor loss) differed in kind from the harm that the \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate acts\xe2\x80\x9d (securities fraud) would ordinarily cause (stock-related monetary losses).  The harm was \xe2\x80\x9cindirect\xe2\x80\x9d in the sense that it was entirely derivative of the more direct harm the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s actions had caused the broker-dealers; and, there were several steps between the violation and the harm (misrepresentation\xe2\x80\x94broker-dealer losses\xe2\x80\x94broker-dealer business failure\xe2\x80\x94ordinary creditor loss).  Here, however, the plaintiff alleges a harm (lost customers) that flows directly from the lower prices and the opening of a new outlet\xe2\x80\x94actions that were themselves allegedly caused by activity that Congress designed RICO to forbid (conducting a business through a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate acts\xe2\x80\x9d and investing in a business funds derived from such a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this sense, the causal links before us are more \xe2\x80\x9cdirect\xe2\x80\x9d than those in <em>Holmes.</em>  See <em>ante,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (Thomas, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, I agree with the majority that <em>Holmes </em>points the way.  That case makes clear that RICO contains important limitations on the scope of private rights of action.  It specifies that RICO does not provide a private right of action \xe2\x80\x9csimply on showing that the defendant violated \xc2\xa71962, the plaintiff was injured, and the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s violation was a \xe2\x80\x98but for\xe2\x80\x99 cause of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 265\xe2\x80\x93266 (footnote omitted).  Pointing out \xe2\x80\x9cthe very unlikelihood that Congress meant to allow <em>all</em> factually injured plaintiffs to recover,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 266<em> </em>(emphasis added), <em>Holmes</em> concludes that RICO imposes a requirement of \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause,\xe2\x80\x9d a phrase that \xe2\x80\x9clabel[s] generically the judicial tools used to limit a person\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility for the consequences of that person\xe2\x80\x99s own acts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 268.  It recognizes that these tools seek to discern \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98what justice demands, or . . . what is administratively possible and convenient.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa741, p. 264 (5th ed. 1984)).  It also explains that \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause\xe2\x80\x9d demands \xe2\x80\x9cdirectness,\xe2\x80\x9d while specifying that \xe2\x80\x9cdirectness\xe2\x80\x9d is only one of \xe2\x80\x9cthe many shapes this concept took at common law.\xe2\x80\x9d  503 U. S., at 268\xe2\x80\x93269.<em> </em>And it points to antitrust law, both as a source of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s treble-damages provisions and as an aid to their interpretation.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the \xe2\x80\x9cantitrust\xe2\x80\x9d nature of the treble-damage provision\xe2\x80\x99s source, taken together with both RICO\xe2\x80\x99s basic objectives and important administrative concerns, implies that a cause is \xe2\x80\x9cindirect,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e</em>., it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cproximate cause,\xe2\x80\x9d if the causal chain from forbidden act to the injury caused a competitor proceeds through a legitimate business\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary competitive activity.  To use a physical metaphor, ordinary competitive actions undertaken by the defendant competitor cut the <em>direct</em> causal link between the plaintiff competitor\xe2\x80\x99s injuries and the forbidden acts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The basic objective of antitrust law is to encourage the competitive process.  In particular, that law encourages businesses to compete by offering lower prices, better products, better methods of production, and better systems of distribution.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 1 P. Areeda &amp; H. Hovenkamp, Antitrust Law: An Analysis of Antitrust Principles and Their Application \xc2\xb6100a, pp. 3\xe2\x80\x934 (2d ed. 2000).  As I shall explain, these principles suggest that RICO does not permit private action based solely upon this competitive type of harm, <em>i.e</em>., harm a plaintiff suffers only because the defendant was able to attract customers through normal competitive methods, such as lower prices, better products, better methods of production, or better systems of distribution.  In such cases, the harm falls outside the limits that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private treble-damages provision\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cproximate-cause\xe2\x80\x9d requirement imposes.  In such cases the distance between the harm and the predicate acts that funded (or otherwise enabled) such ordinary competitive activity is too distant.  The harm is not \xe2\x80\x9cdirect.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, those principles suggest that other types of competitive injuries not within their protective ambit could lie within, not outside, \xe2\x80\x9cproximate-cause\xe2\x80\x9d limits.  Where, for example, a RICO defendant attracts customers in ways that involve illegitimate competitive means, <em>e.g.,</em> by threatening violence, a claim may still lie.  Claims involving RICO violations that objectively target a particular competitor, <em>e.g.,</em> bribing an official to harass a competitor, could also be actionable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Several considerations lead to this conclusion.  First,  I have found no case (outside the Second Circuit, from which this case arose) in which a court has authorized a private treble-damages suit based upon no more than a legitimate business\xe2\x80\x99s ordinary pro-competitive activity (even where financed by the proceeds of a RICO predicate act).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, an effort to bring harm caused by ordinary competitive activity within the scope of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private treble-damages action provision will raise serious problems of administrability.  <em>Ante, </em>at 6\xe2\x80\x938 (majority opinion); see also <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 269.  To demonstrate that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lower price caused a plaintiff to lose customers (or profits) requires the plaintiff to show what would have happened in its absence.  Would customers have changed suppliers irrespective of the price change because of other differences in the suppliers?  Would other competing firms have lowered their prices?  Would higher prices have attracted new entry?  Would demand for the industry\xe2\x80\x99s product, or the geographic scope of the relevant market, have changed?  If so, how?  To answer such questions based upon actual market circumstances and to apportion damages among the various competitors harmed is difficult even for plaintiffs trying to trace harm caused by a defendants\xe2\x80\x99 <em>anti-</em>competitive behavior.  <em>Associated Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc.</em> v. <em>Carpenters,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/459/519/index.html">459 U. S. 519</a>, 542, 544 (1983) (the possibility that harm \xe2\x80\x9cmay have been produced by independent factors\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger of complex apportionment of damages\xe2\x80\x9d weigh against finding the requisite causal connection in an antitrust case).  To answer such questions in the context of better functioning markets, where prices typically reflect competitive conditions, would likely prove yet more difficult.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, where other victims, say victims of the underlying RICO \xe2\x80\x9cpredicate acts\xe2\x80\x9d are present, there is no pressing need to provide such an action.  Those alternative victims (here the State of New York) typically \xe2\x80\x9ccould be counted on to bring suit for the law\xe2\x80\x99s vindication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Holmes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 273.  They could thus fulfill Congress\xe2\x80\x99 aim in adopting the civil remedy of \xe2\x80\x9cturn[ing victims] into prosecutors, \xe2\x80\x98private attorneys general,\xe2\x80\x99 dedicated to eliminating racketeering activity.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Rotella</em> v. <em>Wood,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/528/549/index.html">528 U. S. 549</a>, 557 (2000) (quoting <em>Klehr</em> v. <em>A.\xc2\xa0O. Smith Corp.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/179/index.html">521 U. S. 179</a>, 187 (1997)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fourth, this approach to proximate cause would retain private actions aimed at the heart of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 relevant RICO concerns.  RICO\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors, in reporting their underlying reasons for supporting RICO, emphasized, not the fair, ordinary competition that an infiltrated business might offer its competitors, but the risk that such a business would act corruptly, exercising <em>unfair</em> methods of competition.  S.\xc2\xa0Rep. No. 91\xe2\x80\x93617, pp. 76\xe2\x80\x9378 (1969); see also <em>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd.</em> v. <em>King, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/158/index.html">533 U. S. 158</a>, 165 (2001).  RICO focuses upon the \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltration of legitimate business by organized crime,\xe2\x80\x9d in significant part because, when \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98organized crime moves into a business, it brings all the techniques of violence and intimidation which it used in its illegal businesses.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</em> v. <em>Imrex Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/479/index.html">473 U. S. 479</a>,  517, 515 (1985) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (quoting 113 Cong. Rec. 17999 (1967)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My approach would not rule out private actions in such cases.  Nor would it rule out three of the four suits mentioned by Justice Marshall, dissenting in <em>Sedima</em>, when he describes RICO\xe2\x80\x99s objectives<em>.  </em>It would not rule out lawsuits by injured competitors or legitimate investors if a racketeer, \xe2\x80\x9cuses \xe2\x80\x98[t]hreats, arson and assault \xe2\x80\xa6 to force competitors out of business\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cuses arson and threats to induce honest businessmen to pay protection money, or to purchase certain goods, or to hire certain workers\xe2\x80\x9d; or \xe2\x80\x9cdisplace[s]\xe2\x80\x9d an \xe2\x80\x9chonest investor\xe2\x80\x9d when he \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrates and obtains control of a legitimate business \xe2\x80\xa6 through fraud\xe2\x80\x9d or the like.  473 U. S., at 521\xe2\x80\x93522.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I concede that the approach would rule out a competitor\xe2\x80\x99s lawsuit based on no more than an \xe2\x80\x9cinfiltrated enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d operating a legitimate business to a businessman\xe2\x80\x99s competitive disadvantage because unlawful predicate acts helped that legitimate business build \xe2\x80\x9ca strong economic base.\xe2\x80\x9d  And I recognize that this latter kind of suit at least arguably would have provided helpful deterrence had the view of <em>Sedima\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting Justices</em> prevailed.  <em>Id.,</em> at 500\xe2\x80\x93523 (Marshall, J., dissenting) (arguing that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private action provision did not authorize suits based on harm flowing directly from predicate acts); <em>id., </em>at 523\xe2\x80\x93530 (Powell, J., dissenting) (same).  But the dissent did not prevail, and the need for deterrence consequently offers only weakened support for a reading of RICO that authorizes private suits in this category.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth, without this limitation, RICO enforcement and basic antitrust policy could well collide.  Firms losing the competitive battle might find bases for a RICO attack on their more successful competitors in claimed misrepresentations or even comparatively minor misdeeds by that competitor.  Firms that fear such treble-damages suits might hesitate to compete vigorously, particularly in concentrated industries where harm to a competitor is more easily traced but where the consumer\xe2\x80\x99s need for vigorous competition is particularly strong.  The ultimate victim of any such tendency to pull ordinary competitive punches of course would be not the competing business, but the consumer.  Although Congress did not intend its RICO treble-damages provision as a simple copy of the antitrust laws\xe2\x80\x99 similar remedies, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Sedima</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 498\xe2\x80\x93499, there is no sound reason to interpret RICO\xe2\x80\x99s treble-damages provision as if Congress intended to set it and its antitrust counterpart at cross-purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I would read into the private treble-damages provision a \xe2\x80\x9cproximate-cause\xe2\x80\x9d limitation that places outside the provision harms that are traceable to an unlawful act only through a form of legitimate competitive activity.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this approach to the present case, I would hold that neither of Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s counts states a RICO private treble-damages claim.  National is a legitimate business.  Another private plaintiff (the State of New York) is available.  The question is whether Ideal asserts a harm caused directly by something other than ordinary competitive activity, <em>i.e</em>., lower prices, a better product, a better distribution system, or a better production method.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s second count claims injury caused by National\xe2\x80\x99s (1) having taken customers (2) attracted by its new store (3) that it financed in part through profits generated by the tax fraud scheme, and the financing is the relevant violation.  \xc2\xa71962(a).  The opening of a distribution outlet is a legitimate competitive activity.  It benefits the firm that opens it by making it more convenient for customers to purchase from that supplier.  That ordinary competitive process is all the complaint describes.  And for the reasons I have given in Part II, <em>supra,</em> I believe that the financing of a new store\xe2\x80\x94even with funds generated by unlawful activities\xe2\x80\x94is not sufficient to create a private cause of action as long as the activity funded amounts to legitimate competitive activity.  Ideal must look for other remedies, <em>e.g.</em>, bringing the facts to the attention of the United States Attorney or the State of New York.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ideal\xe2\x80\x99s first count presents a more difficult question.  It alleges that National filed false sales tax returns to the State of New York.  As an action indictable under the federal mail fraud statute, that action is a predicate act under RICO.  See \xc2\xa71961(1) (2000 ed., Supp. III).  National passed these savings on to its cash customers by not charging them sales tax, thereby attracting more cash customers than it would have without the scheme.  Is this a form of injury caused, not by ordinary competitive activity, but simply by the predicate act itself?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view, the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  The complaint alleges predicate acts that amount simply to the facts that National did not \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpay\xe2\x80\x9d sales taxes or accurately \xe2\x80\x9creport\xe2\x80\x9d sales figures to the State.  National did not tell its customers, \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not pay sales taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it simply charged the customer a lower price, say, $100 rather than $100 plus $8 tax.  Consider a retailer who advertises to the customer a $100 table and adds, \xe2\x80\x9cWe pay all sales taxes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Such a retailer is telling the customer that he will charge the customer a lower price by the amount of the tax, <em>i.e.</em>, about $92.  The retailer implies that he, the retailer, will pay the tax to the State, taking the requisite amount owed to the State from the $100 the customer paid for the item.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendants here have done no more.  They have in effect cut the price of the item by the amount of the sales tax and then kept the money instead of passing it on to the State.  They funded the price cut from the savings, but the source of the savings is, in my view, beside the point as long as the price cut itself is legitimate.
