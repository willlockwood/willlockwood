Wood filed a federal habeas petition in 2008.  After receiving Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court asked the State if it planned to argue that the petition was untimely.  In response, the State twice informed the District Court that it would \xe2\x80\x9cnot challenge, but [was] not conceding,\xe2\x80\x9d the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  Thereafter, the District Court rejected Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claims on the merits.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit ordered the parties to brief both the merits and the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  After briefing, the court held the petition time barred, concluding that the court had authority to raise timeliness on its own motion, and that the State had not taken the issue off the table by declining to raise a statute of limitations defense in the District Court.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld: \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t1.\xc2\xa0Courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\xe2\x80\x94though not the obligation\xe2\x80\x94to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative in exceptional cases.

Greer, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129\n, this Court recognized a modest exception to the rule that a federal court will not consider a forfeited defense.  There, the Seventh Circuit addressed a nonexhaustion defense the State raised for the first time on appeal.  The exhaustion doctrine, this Court noted, is founded on concerns broader than those of the parties; in particular, the doctrine fosters respectful, harmonious relations between the state and federal judiciaries.  Id., at 133\xe2\x80\x93135.  With that comity interest in mind, the Court held that federal appellate courts have discretion to consider a nonexhaustion argument inadvertently overlooked by the State in the district court.  Id. at 132, 134.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn Day, the Court affirmed a federal district court\xe2\x80\x99s authority to consider a forfeited habeas defense when extraordinary circumstances so warrant.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 201.  The State in Day, having miscalculated a time span, erroneously informed the District Court that Day\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition was timely.  Apprised of the error by a Magistrate Judge, the District Court, sua sponte, dismissed the petition as untimely.  This Court affirmed, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cdistrict courts are permitted, but not obliged, to consider, sua\xc2\xa0sponte, the timeliness of a state prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 209.  Such leeway was appropriate, the Court again reasoned, because AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 205.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court clarified, however, that a federal court does not have carte blanche to depart from the principle of party presentation.  See Greenlaw v. United States, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 237\n\xe2\x80\x93244.  It would be \xe2\x80\x9can abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x9d for a court \xe2\x80\x9cto override a State\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Day, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 202.  In Day itself, the State\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness concession resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertent error,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 211, not a deliberate decision to proceed to the merits.

The institutional interests served by AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations are also present when a habeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense.

In the District Court, the State was well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it, and of the arguments that could be made in support of that defense.  Yet, the State twice informed the District Court that it would not \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge\xe2\x80\x9d the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  In so doing, the State deliberately waived the statute of limitations defense.  In light of that waiver, the Tenth Circuit should have followed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s lead and decided the merits of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.

After state prisoner Patrick Wood filed a federal habeas corpus petition, the State twice informed the U.\xc2\xa0S. District Court that it \xe2\x80\x9c[would] not challenge, but [is] not conceding, the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 70a; see id., at 87a.  Thereafter, the District Court rejected Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claims on the merits.  On appeal, the Tenth Circuit directed the parties to brief the question whether Wood\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition was timely.  Post-briefing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition, but solely on the ground that it was untimely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur precedent establishes that a court may consider a statute of limitations or other threshold bar the State failed to raise in answering a habeas petition.  Granberry v. Greer, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129, \n134 (1987)\n (exhaustion defense); Day v. McDonough, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198, \n202 (2006)\n (statute of limitations defense).  Does court discretion to take up timeliness hold when a State is aware of a limitations defense, and intelligently chooses not to rely on it in the court of first instance?  The answer Day instructs is \xe2\x80\x9cno\xe2\x80\x9d: A court is not at liberty, we have cautioned, to bypass, override, or excuse a State\xe2\x80\x99s deliberate waiver of a limitations defense.  Id., at 202, 210, n.\xc2\xa011.  The Tenth Circuit, we accordingly hold, abused its discretion by resurrecting the limitations issue instead of reviewing the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s disposition on the merits of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the course of a 1986 robbery at a pizza shop in a Colorado town, the shop\xe2\x80\x99s assistant manager was shot and killed.  Petitioner Patrick Wood was identified as the per-petrator.  At a bench trial in January 1987, Wood was convicted of murder, robbery, and menacing, and sentenced to life imprisonment.  The Colorado Court of Appeals affirmed Wood\xe2\x80\x99s convictions and sentence on direct appeal in May 1989, and the Colorado Supreme Court denied Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition for certiorari five months later.  Wood did not ask this Court to review his conviction in the 90 days he had to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWood then pursued postconviction relief, asserting con-stitutional infirmities in his trial, conviction, and sentence.  Prior to the federal petition at issue here, which was filed in 2008, Wood, proceeding pro se, twice sought relief in state court.  First, in 1995, he filed a motion to vacate his conviction and sentence pursuant to Colorado Rule of Criminal Procedure 35(c) (1984).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  He also asked the Colorado trial court to appoint counsel to aid him in pursuit of the motion.  When some months passed with no responsive action, Wood filed a request for a ruling on his motion and accompanying request for counsel.  The state court then granted Wood\xe2\x80\x99s plea for the appointment of counsel, but the record is completely blank on any further action regarding the 1995 motion.  Second, Wood filed a new pro se motion for postconviction relief in Colorado court in 2004.  On the first page of his second motion, he indicated that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o other postconviction proceedings [had been] filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Record in No. 08\xe2\x80\x93cv\xe2\x80\x9300247 (D Colo.), Doc. 15\xe2\x80\x935 (Exh.

Consistently, in its full an-swer to Wood\xe2\x80\x99s federal petition, the State repeated: \xe2\x80\x9cRespondents are not challenging, but do not concede, the timeliness of the petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 87a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDisposing of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the District Court dismissed certain claims for failure to exhaust state remedies, and denied on the merits Wood\xe2\x80\x99s two remaining claims\xe2\x80\x94one alleging a double jeopardy violation and one challenging the validity of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s waiver of his \n \nSixth Amendment right to a jury trial.

After briefing, the Court of Appeals affirmed the denial of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition without addressing the merits; instead, the Tenth Circuit held the petition time barred.  403 Fed.

See supra, at 2.  Wood\xe2\x80\x99s time for filing a federal petition therefore began to run on the date of AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, April 24, 1996, and expired on April 24, 1997, unless Wood had a \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed\xe2\x80\x9d application for state postconviction relief \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d in Colorado state court during that period.  Wood maintains he had such an application pending on April 24, 1996: the Rule 35(c) motion he filed in 1995.  That motion, Wood asserts, remained pending (thus continuing to suspend the one-year clock) until at least August 2004, when he filed his second motion for postconviction relief in state court.  The 2004 motion, the State does not contest, was \xe2\x80\x9cproperly filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wood argues that this second motion further tolled the limitations period until February 5, 2007, exactly one year before he filed the federal petition at issue here.  If Wood is correct that his 1995 motion remained \xe2\x80\x9cpending\xe2\x80\x9d in state court from April 1996 until August 2004, his federal petition would be timely.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn its preanswer response to Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition, the State set forth its comprehension of the statute of limitations issue.  It noted that Wood\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctime for filing a habeas petition began to run on April 24, 1996, when the AEDPA became effective\xe2\x80\x9d and that Wood \xe2\x80\x9chad until April 24, 1997, plus any tolling periods, to timely file his habeas petition.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 69a\xe2\x80\x9370a.  The State next identified the crucial question: Did Wood\xe2\x80\x99s 1995 state petition arrest the one-year statute of limitations period from 1996 until 2004?  Id., at 70a.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is certainly arguable,\xe2\x80\x9d the State then asserted, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the 1995 postconviction motion was abandoned before 1997 and thus did not toll the AEDPA statute of limitations at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

The District Court in Granberry denied a federal habeas petition on the merits.  Id., at 130.  On appeal, the State argued for the first time that the petition should be dismissed because the petitioner had failed to exhaust relief available in state court.  Ibid.  See Habeas Corpus Rule 5(b) (list- ing \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to exhaust state remedies\xe2\x80\x9d as a threshold bar to federal habeas relief).  Despite the State\xe2\x80\x99s failure to raise the nonexhaustion argument in the District Court, the Seventh Circuit accepted the argument and ruled for the State on that ground.  We granted certiorari to decide whether a court of appeals has discretion to address a non-exhaustion defense that the State failed to raise in the district court.

Id., at 203.  As a result, the State erroneously informed the District Court that Day\xe2\x80\x99s petition was timely.  Ibid.  A Magistrate Judge caught the State\xe2\x80\x99s computation error and recommended that the petition be dismissed as untimely, notwithstanding the State\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness concession.

Affording federal courts leeway to consider a forfeited timeliness defense was appropriate, we again reasoned, because AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations, like the exhaustion doctrine, \xe2\x80\x9cimplicat[es] values beyond the concerns of the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  Day, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 205 (quoting Acosta v.

See Greenlaw v. United States, \n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 237\n\xe2\x80\x93244 (2008).  Only where the State does not \xe2\x80\x9cstrategically withh[o]ld the [limitations] defense or cho[o]se to relinquish it,\xe2\x80\x9d and where the petitioner is accorded a fair opportunity to present his position, may a district court consider the defense on its own initiative and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98determine whether the interests of justice would be better served\xe2\x80\x99 by addressing the merits or by dismissing the petition as time barred.\xe2\x80\x9d  Day, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 210\xe2\x80\x93211 (quoting Granberry, 481 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 136; internal quotation marks omitted).

In Day\xe2\x80\x99s case itself, we emphasized, the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession of timeliness resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertent error,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 211, not from any deliberate decision to proceed straightaway to the merits.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsistent with Granberry and Day, we decline to adopt an absolute rule barring a court of appeals from rais- ing, on its own motion, a forfeited timeliness defense.  The institutional interests served by AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations are also present when a habeas case moves to the court of appeals, a point Granberry recognized with respect to a nonexhaustion defense.  We accordingly hold, in response to the first question presented, see supra, at 4, that courts of appeals, like district courts, have the authority\xe2\x80\x94though not the obligation\xe2\x80\x94to raise a forfeited timeliness defense on their own initiative.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe turn now to the second, case-specific, inquiry.  See ibid.  Although a court of appeals has discretion to address, sua sponte, the timeliness of a habeas petition, appellate courts should reserve that authority for use in exceptional cases.  For good reason, appellate courts ordinarily abstain from entertaining issues that have not been raised and preserved in the court of first instance.  See supra, at 6.  That restraint is all the more appropriate when the appellate court itself spots an issue the parties did not air below, and therefore would not have antici-pated in developing their arguments on appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tDue regard for the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s processes and time investment is also a consideration appellate courts should not overlook.  It typically takes a district court more time to decide a habeas case on the merits, than it does to resolve a petition on threshold procedural grounds.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, R. Hanson &amp; H. Daley, Federal Habeas Corpus Review: Challenging State Court Criminal Convictions 23 (NCJ\xe2\x80\x93155504, 1995) (district courts spent an average of 477 days to decide a habeas petition on the merits, and 268 days to resolve a petition on procedural grounds).  When a court of appeals raises a procedural impediment to disposition on the mer-its, and disposes of the case on that ground, the district court\xe2\x80\x99s labor is discounted and the appellate court acts not as a court of review but as one of first view.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the foregoing discussion of the relevant considerations, we hold that the Tenth Circuit abused its discretion when it dismissed Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition as untimely.  In the District Court, the State was well aware of the statute of limitations defense available to it and of the arguments that could be made in support of the defense.  See supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Yet the State twice informed the District Court that it \xe2\x80\x9cwill not challenge, but [is] not conceding\xe2\x80\x9d the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  See supra, at 3.  Essentially, the District Court asked the State: Will you oppose the petition on statute of limitations grounds?  The State answered: Such a challenge would be supportable, but we won\xe2\x80\x99t make the challenge here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9c[W]aiver is the \xe2\x80\x98intentional relinquishment or abandonment of a known right.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Kontrick v. Ryan, \n\n540 U.\xc2\xa0S. 443\n, n.\xc2\xa013 (2004) (quoting United States v. Olano, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 725, \n733 (1993)\n).  The State\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this case fits that description.  Its decision not to contest the timeliness of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition did not stem from an \xe2\x80\x9cinadvertent er-ror,\xe2\x80\x9d as did the State\xe2\x80\x99s concession in Day.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 211.  Rather, the State, after expressing its clear and accurate understanding of the timeliness issue, see supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, deliberately steered the District Court away from the question and towards the merits of Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  In short, the State knew it had an \xe2\x80\x9carguable\xe2\x80\x9d statute of limitations defense, see supra, at 5, yet it chose, in no uncertain terms, to refrain from interposing a timeliness \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge\xe2\x80\x9d to Wood\xe2\x80\x99s petition.  The District Court therefore reached and decided the merits of the petition.

McDonough, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 198 (2006)\n, the Court held that a federal district court may raise sua\xc2\xa0sponte a forfeited statute of limitations defense to a habeas corpus petition.  Relying on Day and Granberry v. Greer, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 129 (1987)\n, the Court now holds that a court of appeals may do the same.  Because I continue to think that Day was wrongly decided and that Granberry is inapposite, I cannot join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  See Day, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212\xe2\x80\x93219 (Scalia, J., joined by Thomas and Breyer, JJ., dissenting).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the dissent in Day explained, the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure apply in habeas corpus cases to the extent that they are consistent with the Habeas Corpus Rules, the habeas corpus statute, and the historical practice of habeas proceedings.  Id., at 212 (citing Gonzalez v. Crosby, \n\n545 U.\xc2\xa0S. 524\n\xe2\x80\x93530 (2005), and Woodford v. Garceau, \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 202, \n208 (2003)\n).  As relevant here, the Rules of Civil Procedure provide that a defendant forfeits his statute of limitations defense if he fails to raise it in his answer or in an amendment thereto.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212 (citing Rules 8(c), 12(b), 15(a)).  That forfeiture rule is fully consistent with habeas corpus procedure.  As an initial matter, the rule comports with the Habeas Rules\xe2\x80\x99 instruction that a State \xe2\x80\x9cmust\xe2\x80\x9d plead any limitations defense in its answer.  Id., at 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (quoting Rule 5(b) (emphasis deleted)).  Moreover, the rule does not conflict with the habeas statute, which imposes a 1-year period of limitations without any indication that typical forfeiture rules do not apply.  Id., at 213 (citing \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)).  Finally, the rule does not interfere with historical practice.  Prior to the enactment of a habeas statute of limitations in the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), habeas practice included no limitations pe- riod at all, much less one immune to forfeiture.  547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 212.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs the dissent in Day further explained, id., at 214, AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations is distinguishable from the equitable defenses that we have traditionally permitted federal habeas courts to raise sua\xc2\xa0sponte.  See, e.g., Granberry, supra, at 133 (holding that appellate courts may consider a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s failure to exhaust state rem- edies despite a State\xe2\x80\x99s forfeiture of the defense).  Those judicially created defenses were rooted in concerns of comity and finality that arise when federal courts collaterally review state criminal convictions.  Day, 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 214.  But those same concerns did not lead this Court to recognize any equitable time bar against habeas petitions.  Id., at 214\xe2\x80\x93215.  Thus, nothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing doctrine of equitable defenses supported the Day Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdecision to beef up the presumptively forfeitable \xe2\x80\x98limitations period\xe2\x80\x99 of \xc2\xa72244(d) by making it the subject of sua sponte dismissal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 215\xe2\x80\x93216.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I believe that the Day Court was wrong to hold that district courts may raise sua\xc2\xa0sponte forfeited statute of limitations defenses in habeas cases.  I therefore would not extend Day\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning to proceedings in the courts of appeals.  Appellate courts, moreover, are particularly ill suited to consider issues forfeited below.  Unlike district courts, courts of appeals cannot permit a State to amend its answer to add a defense, nor can they develop the facts that are often necessary to resolve questions of timeliness.  Cf. id., at 209 (majority opinion) (finding no difference between a district court\xe2\x80\x99s ability to raise a forfeited limitations defense sua\xc2\xa0sponte and its ability to notice the State\xe2\x80\x99s forfeiture and permit an amended pleading under Rule of Civil Procedure 15).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of these considerations, I cannot join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that a court of appeals has discretion to consider sua\xc2\xa0sponte a forfeited limitations defense.  Nor can I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s separate holding that the Court of Appeals abused its discretion by raising a defense that had been deliberately waived by the State.  As the dissent in Day noted, there is no principled reason to distinguish between forfeited and waived limitations defenses when determining whether courts may raise such defenses sua\xc2\xa0sponte.  See 547 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 218, n.\xc2\xa03 (explaining that, if \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98values beyond the concerns of the parties\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d justify sua\xc2\xa0sponte consideration of forfeited defenses, such values equally support sua\xc2\xa0sponte consideration of waived defenses).  Therefore, I concur only in the judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
