JUSTICE REED delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The Standard Oil Company, a New Jersey corporation, appeals from a judgment of the Supreme Court of New Jersey insofar as it declares escheated to the New Jersey unpaid dividends declared upon the stock of Standard Oil, and twelve shares of the common stock of the Company. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 341 U. S. 430</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The New Jersey Escheat Act reads in part:</p>\n<p>"If any person, who at the time of his death, has been or shall have been, the owner of any personal property within this State, and shall have died, or shall die, intestate, without heirs or known kindred, capable of inheriting the same, and without leaving a surviving spouse, such personal property, of whatsoever nature the same may be, shall escheat to the State."</p>\n<p>"Whenever the owner, beneficial owner, or person entitled to any personal property within this State, has been or shall be and remain unknown for the period of fourteen successive years, or whenever the whereabouts of such owner, beneficial owner or person, has been or shall be and remain unknown for the period of fourteen successive years, or whenever any personal property wherever situate has been or shall be and remain unclaimed for the period of fourteen successive years, then, in any such event, such personal property shall escheat to the State."</p>\n<p>N.J.Rev.Stat. 2:53-16, 2:53-17.</p>\n<p>In accordance with the procedure prescribed by the Act, a petition in the name of the New Jersey for a decree escheating certain personal property, [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] including the property in issue here, was filed in the Chancery Division of the Superior Court of New Jersey.  The petition alleged that appellant had in its custody or possession property which was subject to escheat under the Act </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 341 U. S. 431</a></p><p> for each of the alternative reasons listed in the above provisions:  the owners of the property had died intestate without leaving anyone capable of taking the property; the owners had been unknown for fourteen successive years; the whereabouts of the owners had been unknown for fourteen successive years; the property had been unclaimed for fourteen successive years.</p>\n<p>The appellant answered the petition and, after notice and hearing, the Chancery Division of the Superior Court entered a final judgment ordering escheat of the personal property.  2 N.J.Super. 442, 64 A.2d 386, 5 N.J.Super. 460, 68 A.2d 499.  This judgment was modified and affirmed as modified by the Supreme Court of New Jersey.  5 N.J. 281, 74 A.2d 565.</p>\n<p>Standard Oil, appealing from the decision of the Supreme Court of New Jersey, claims that the New Jersey Escheat Act and the judgment thereunder deprived the Company of its property without due process of law in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.  This unconstitutional deprivation is alleged to arise from the fact that the judgment of escheat does not protect Standard Oil from later liability to the stockholders whose claims to stock and dividends are escheated, because:  (1) both the notice to the claimants of the property prescribed by the statute and the notice actually published were so inadequate that claimants were afforded no reasonable opportunity to learn of the escheat proceeding and of its effect on their claims, or to appear and protect their rights; (2) the obligation of the contracts of the persons whose property was escheated was impaired by the statute and judgment thereunder in violation of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, \xef\xbf\xbd 1 of the Constitution of the United States; (3) the New Jersey courts were without jurisdiction to enter the judgment, since neither the shares of stock nor the dividends </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 341 U. S. 432</a></p><p> had a situs in New Jersey for the purpose of escheat, nor were either lawfully seized in the escheat proceedings. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Notice.</em> -- Appellant contends that the judgment of escheat deprives the various claimants against Standard Oil of their property without adequate notice, and since the claimants may therefore sue appellant later and recover on these claims, this statute and judgment deprive appellant of its property without due process of law. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 341 U. S. 433</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The statute, N.J.Rev.Stat. 2:53-21, provides:</p>\n<p>"A notice containing a summary of the order designating the time and place of hearing, as approved by the court shall be published in a manner directed by the court and shall also be published once a week for three successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation designated by the court. . . ."</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court of New Jersey authoritatively construed this to require "that the notice shall identify the property of which escheat is sought and the last known owner."  5 N.J. at 307, 74 A.2d at 577. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The published notice in this case corresponded with this construction.  It described the property in accordance with the state court\'s understanding of the requirements of N.J.Rev.Stat. 2:53-21, and clearly indicated that the petition was one for escheat.</p>\n<p>This case differs from <em>Wuchter v. Pizutti,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/13/case.html">276 U. S. 13</a></span>, relied on by appellant, since it is not here attempted to validate a defective statutory provision for notice by recourse to the sufficiency of the notice which, although not required by statute, was in fact, given.  Here, it is the statute itself, as interpreted by the state court, which requires what we think is adequate notice.</p>\n<p>In <em>Security Savings Bank v. California,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html">263 U. S. 282</a></span>, a case involving statutory escheat of the bank deposits presumed abandoned, where nothing to the contrary is known by bank officials, because unused and unclaimed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 341 U. S. 434</a></p><p> for twenty years, it was similarly contended the bank was denied due process because depositors would not be bound by the judgment of escheat.  263 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html#286">263 U. S. 286</a></span>.  This Court said</p>\n<p>"[T]he essentials of jurisdiction over the deposits are that there be seizure of the res at the commencement of the suit, and reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard."</p>\n<p>263 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html#287">263 U. S. 287</a></span>.  The procedural provision made the depositors affected parties and required publication in Sacramento County, only, of the summons with no requirement of the depositors\' addresses.  Delivery of a copy of the summons on the bank was commanded.  It was held, 263 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html#287">263 U. S. 287</a></span>, that the personal service on the bank effected seizure of the deposit and the publication of the summons was effective as similar publication would be in litigation involving unknown persons with possible claims to property.  <em>Cf. Anderson National Bank v. Luckett,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/233/case.html">321 U. S. 233</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/233/case.html#243">321 U. S. 243</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In <em>Mullane v. Central Hanover Trust Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html">339 U. S. 306</a></span>, in a proceeding to settle trusts with numerous parties as possible beneficiaries whose names and interests were unknown to the trustee, we commented on the subject of notice:</p>\n<p>"This Court has not hesitated to approve of resort to publication as a customary substitute in another class of cases where it is not reasonably possible or practicable to give more adequate warning."</p>\n<p>339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#317">339 U. S. 317</a></span>.  We held that:</p>\n<p>"Accordingly, we overrule appellant\'s constitutional objections to published notice insofar as they are urged on behalf of any beneficiaries whose interests or addresses are unknown to the trustee."</p>\n<p>339 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/339/306/case.html#318">339 U. S. 318</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The sound reasons stated in the foregoing cases for deeming the notices there given adequate to bind interested persons in the respective proceedings lead us to the conclusion that the notice by publication in this case was </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 341 U. S. 435</a></p><p> adequate.  If the state has the responsibility of looking after abandoned property subject to its sovereign power, these publications are adequate to affect the owner\'s rights.</p>\n<p><em>Impairment of Contract.</em> -- Appellant attacks the validity of the New Jersey escheat statute on the ground that it impairs the contract rights of the owners of the dividends and stock certificates in violation of Art. I, \xc2\xa7 10, cl. 1, of the Constitution:  "No State shall . . . pass any . . .Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts. . . ."  This New Jersey law was enacted to authorize the state to take possession of "personal property" whenever the owner entitled to that "personal property within [New Jersey] . . . shall be and remain unknown" or his "whereabouts" remain unknown or the property remains "unclaimed" for fourteen successive years.  N.J.Rev.Stat. 2:53-15 and 17.  We need not consider whether a state possesses inherent power for such legislation as to personalty as the successor to a prerogative of royal sovereignty. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>As a broad principle of jurisprudence, rather than as a result of the evolution of legal rules, it is clear that a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 341 U. S. 436</a></p><p> state, subject to constitutional limitations, may use its legislative power to dispose of property within its reach, belonging to unknown persons. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Such property thus escapes seizure by would-be possessors, and is used for the general good, rather than for the chance enrichment of particular individuals or organizations.  Normally the obligor or holder and the obligee or owner of abandoned property would, as here, have no contractual arrangement between themselves for its disposition in case of the owner\'s failure to make claim.  As the disposition of abandoned property is a function of the state, no implied contract arises between obligor and obligee to determine the disposition of such property.  Consequently, there is no impairment of contract by New Jersey\'s statute, enacted subsequent to the creation of the obligations here under examination, but only the exercise of a regulatory power over abandoned property. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 341 U. S. 437</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>Situs of Property.</em> -- Appellant argues that the escheat to New Jersey of the stock and the dividends denies it due process because such property has no situs in New Jersey for the purpose of escheat. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Appellant also contends that it has neither custody nor possession of these debts or demands due from it to its stockholders, and therefore they cannot be seized.  Since the property cannot be seized or escheated, the corporation would remain liable to its stockholders, and to require the payment to the state denies due process.</p>\n<p>Appellant has no tangible property in New Jersey except its stock and transfer books, kept at its registered office, located in the office of an individual at Flemington, New Jersey.  Appellant points out that, in the <em>Security Savings Bank</em> case, 263 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html#285">263 U. S. 285</a></span>, and the <em>Anderson National Bank</em> case, 321 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/321/233/case.html#241">321 U. S. 241</a></span>, the contracts of deposit were made in the respective states by banks doing business therein.  A like situation does not exist here, as the stock was issued and the dividends were held in other states.  Further, it is said that the bank deposit cases did not deal with escheat statutes, but rather, like the <em>Moore</em> case, with conservation statutes.</p>\n<p>It was not solely the fact that the contracts for bank deposits were made in California and Kentucky that gave those states power over the abandoned deposits.  Had the contract been one of bailment between two individual citizens of those states who had subsequently removed in another state, the courts of the state of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 341 U. S. 438</a></p><p> contract would not have controlled, though its laws might have.  The controlling fact was that the banks and the depositors could be served with process, either personally or by publication, to determine rights in this chose in action. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>Appellant is a corporation of New Jersey, amenable to process through its designated agent at its registered office.  N.J.Rev.Stat. 14:4-1, 14:4-2.  <em>Cf. State v. Garford Trucking, Inc.,</em> 4 N.J. 346, 72 A.2d 851.  This gave New Jersey power to seize the <em>res</em> here involved, to-wit, the "debts or demands due to the escheated estate."  And the fact that this is immediate escheat is not significant.  Escheat is permitted against persons whose addresses or existence is unknown. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  The taking-over in the bank deposit cases foreshadowed escheat.  <em>See</em> the <em>Malone</em> case, 221 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/221/660/case.html#664">221 U. S. 664</a></span>, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 341 U.

S. 241</a></span>.</p>\n<p>No matter where the appellant\'s assets may be, since it is its obligation to pay to the escheated estate that is taken, personal service on appellant effects a seizure of that obligation in just the same way that service on a bank is seizure of the deposit as shown in the Notice subdivision of this opinion, <em>supra,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/341/428/case.html#432">341 U. S. 432</a></span>.  That power to seize the debt by jurisdiction over the debtor provides not only the basis for notice to the absent owner, but also for taking over the debt from the debtor.  <em>Security Savings Bank v. California, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/263/282/case.html#287">263 U. S. 287</a></span>.  It is true that fiction plays a part in the jurisprudential concept of control over intangibles.  There is no fiction, however, in the fact that choses in action, stock certificates, and dividends held by the corporation are property.  Whether such property has its situs with the obligor or the obligee or for some purposes with both has given rise to diverse views in this Court.

Like other such relations, it may, of course, be controlled by the law, and by the courts as instruments of the law, but the control must be obtained by making use of the relation.  In order to control the relation, the court must have the power to control both parties to it.  Any court which has both debtor and creditor may compel a release from the creditor and an assignment of the action of the creditor.  In other words, if a debt is to be legally assigned or discharged, it requires the action of both parties, and especially the creditor, and the court which has to apply such a process must do so through its control over both parties."</p>\n<p>27 Harv.L.Rev. at 115-116.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Christianson v.

The foundation of this power is usually conveyed by the concept of situs.  As to this ground of decision, I must dissent.  In <em>Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Moore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/541/case.html">333 U. S. 541</a></span>, this Court sustained a New York statute allowing escheat of the unclaimed proceeds of insurance policies on the basis of the insured\'s residence in the State at the time of the delivery of the policy.  On that basis, the State where the last known owner was domiciled certainly has a better claim to abandoned stock than a State in which it happens that the corporation is subject to process.</p>\n<p>If perchance one is to infer from the opinion that the unclaimed dividends deposited with the Guaranty Trust Company of New York are also escheatable by New York and that New York, had she anticipated New Jersey, could have exhausted all the potentialities of escheat in the unclaimed dividends, there is an added reason for dissent.  The Constitution ought not to be placed in an unseemly light by suggesting that the constitutional rights of the several States depend on, and are terminated by, a race of diligence.  The Bankruptcy Act expresses appropriate condemnation of such unseemly conduct and accidental solution of competing interests.  It is one thing for a State to take custody of abandoned property as trustee, leaving open for subsequent determination what State has a controlling interest justifying escheat.  But if a State wishes to assert its right to escheat property which by its very nature is not exclusively within its control, other interested States should be parties to the litigation.  The right to resort to this Court for a adjudgment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 341 U. S. 445</a></p><p> of conflicting interests among several States has been placed in the Constitution to avoid crude remedies of self-help in the settlement of interstate controversies.  <em>See Texas v. Florida,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/306/398/case.html">306 U. S. 398</a></span>.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS, with whom MR. JUSTICE BLACK concurs, dissenting.</p>\n<p>There are several states with possible claims to the escheat of intangibles.  The state of incorporation of the obligor; the state where the last known owner was domiciled (<em>see Connecticut Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Moore,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/541/case.html">333 U. S. 541</a></span>); the state where later on the true residence of the owner was proved to be; the state of his last known domicile; the state where the obligor has its main place of business; in case of insurance or trust property, the state of residence (or domicile) of the beneficiary.  There may be still other states with claims of an equal or greater dignity to these.  In this case, we have heard from only one -- the state of incorporation.</p>\n<p>I think any of several states, including the state of incorporation, might constitutionally enact a custodial statute under which it undertook to hold the escheated intangibles pending determination by this Court of the claims of competing states.  New Jersey has not done that. New Jersey undertakes to appropriate to her exclusive use (after a short statute of limitations has run) this vast amount of wealth.  Hence, I dissent.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
