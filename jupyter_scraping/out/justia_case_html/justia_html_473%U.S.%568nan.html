Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) of FIFRA authorizes EPA to consider certain previously submitted data only if the "follow-on" registrant has offered to compensate the original registrant for use of the data, and provides for binding arbitration if the registrants fail to agree on compensation.  The arbitrator\'s decision is subject to judicial review only for "fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct."  Appellees, firms engaged in the development and marketing of chemicals used to manufacture pesticides, instituted proceedings in Federal District Court to challenge, <em>inter alia,</em> the constitutionality of the arbitration provisions on the ground that they violate Article III of the Constitution by allocating to arbitrators the functions of judicial officers and by limiting review by an Article III court.  Appellees alleged that EPA had considered their research data in support of other registration applications, that one of the appellees (Stauffer Co.) had invoked the arbitration provisions of \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) against a "follow-on" registrant, and that the arbitration award fell short of the compensation to which Stauffer Co. was entitled.  The District Court held that the claims challenging the arbitration provisions were ripe for decision, and that those provisions violated Article III.</p>\n<p><em>Held:</em></p>\n<p>1.

The arbitration scheme is necessary as a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading the costs of generating adequate information regarding the safety, health, and environmental impact of a potentially dangerous product.  Additionally, the scheme contains its own sanctions and subjects no unwilling defendant to judicial enforcement power.

Monsanto Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html">467 U. S. 986</a></span> (1984).  <em>Monsanto</em> examined whether FIFRA\'s data-consideration provision effects an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth Amendment.  In this case, we address whether Article III of the Constitution prohibits Congress from selecting binding arbitration with only limited judicial review as the mechanism for resolving disputes among participants in FIFRA\'s pesticide registration scheme.  We conclude it does not, and reverse the judgment below.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Court\'s opinion in <em>Monsanto</em> details the development of FIFRA from the licensing and labeling statute enacted in 1947 to the comprehensive regulatory statute of the present.  This case, like <em>Monsanto,</em> concerns the most recent amendment to FIFRA, the Federal Pesticide Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 819 (1978 Act), which sought to correct problems created by the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, 86 Stat. 973 (1972 Act), itself a major revision of prior law.  <em>See Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#991">467 U. S. 991</a></span>-992.</p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>As a precondition for registration of a pesticide, manufacturers must submit research data to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) concerning the product\'s health, safety, and environmental effects.  The 1972 Act established data-sharing provisions intended to streamline pesticide registration procedures, increase competition, and avoid unnecessary duplication of data-generation costs.  S.Rep. No. 92-838, pp. 72-73 (1972) (1972 S.Rep.).  Some evidence suggests that, before 1972, data submitted by one registrant </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 473 U. S. 572</a></p><p> had</p>\n<p>"as a matter of practice but without statutory authority, been considered by the Administrator to support the registration of the same or a similar product by another registrant."</p>\n<p><em>Ruckelshaus v. </em>Monsanto<em> Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1009">467 U. S. 1009</a></span>, n. 14.  Such registrations were colloquially known as "me too" or "follow-on" registrations.  Section 3(c)(1)(D) of the 1972 Act provided statutory authority for the use of previously submitted data, as well as a scheme for sharing the costs of data generation.</p>\n<p>"In effect, the provision instituted a mandatory data-licensing scheme.  The amount of compensation was to be negotiated by the parties, or, in the event negotiations failed, was to be determined by the EPA, subject to judicial review upon instigation of the original data submitter.  The scope of the 1972 data-consideration provision, however, was limited, for any data designated as \'trade secrets or commercial or financial information\' . . . could not be considered at all by EPA to support another registration unless the original submitter consented."</p>\n<p><em>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co., supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#992">467 U. S. 992</a></span>-993.</p>\n<p>Congress enacted the original data-compensation provision in 1972 because it believed "recognizing a limited proprietary interest" in data submitted to support pesticide registrations would provide an added incentive beyond statutory patent protection for research and development of new pesticides.  H.R.Rep. No. 95-663, pp. 17-18 (1977); S.Rep. No. 95334, pp. 7, 34-40 (1977) (1977 S.Rep.).  The data submitters, however, contended that basic health, safety, and environmental data essential to registration of a competing pesticide qualified for protection as a trade secret.  With EPA bogged down in cataloging data and the pesticide industry embroiled in litigation over what types of data could legitimately be designated "trade secrets," new pesticide registrations "ground to a virtual halt."  <em>Id.</em> at 3. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 473 U. S. 573</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The 1978 amendments were a response to the "logjam of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation and trade secret protection."  <em>Ibid.</em>  Congress viewed data-sharing as essential to the registration scheme, <em>id.</em> at 7, but concluded EPA must be relieved of the task of valuation because disputes regarding the compensation scheme had, "for all practical purposes, tied up their registration process" and "[EPA] lacked the expertise necessary to establish the proper amount of compensation."  123 Cong.Rec. 25709 (1977) (statement of Sen. Leahy, floor manager of S. 1678).  Legislators and the Agency agreed that</p>\n<p>"[d]etermining the amount and terms of such compensation are matters that do not require active government involvement, [and] compensation payable should be determined, to the fullest extent practicable, within the private sector."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 25710.</p>\n<p>Against this background, Congress in 1978 amended \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D) and \xc2\xa7 10(b) to clarify that the trade secret exemption from the data-consideration provision did not extend to health, safety, and environmental data.  In addition, the 1978 amendments granted data submitters a 10-year period of exclusive use for data submitted after September 30, 1978, during which time the data may not be cited without the original submitter\'s permission.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(i).</p>\n<p>Regarding compensation for use of data not protected by the 10-year exclusive use provision, the amendment substituted for the EPA Administrator\'s determination of the appropriate compensation a system of negotiation and binding arbitration to resolve compensation disputes among registrants.  Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) authorizes EPA to consider data already in its files in support of a new registration, permit, or new use, but "only if the applicant has made an offer to compensate the original data submitter."  If the applicant and data submitter fail to agree, either may invoke binding arbitration.  The arbitrator\'s decision is subject to judicial review only for "fraud, misrepresentation, or other </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 473 U. S. 574</a></p><p> misconduct."  <em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]   The statute contains its own sanctions.  Should an applicant or data submitter fail to comply with the scheme, the Administrator is required to cancel the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="575">Page 473 U. S. 575</a></p><p> new registration or to consider the data without compensation to the original submitter.  The Administrator may also issue orders regarding sale or use of existing pesticide stocks.  <em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The concept of retaining statutory compensation but substituting binding arbitration for valuation of data by EPA emerged as a compromise.  This approach was developed by representatives of the major chemical manufacturers, who sought to retain the controversial compensation provision, in discussions with industry groups representing follow-on registrants, whose attempts to register pesticides had been roadblocked by litigation since 1972.  Hearings on Extending and Amending FIFRA before the Subcommittee on Department Investigations, Oversight, and Research of the House Committee on Agriculture, 95th Cong., 1st Sess., 522-523 (1977) (testimony of Robert Alikonis, General Counsel to Pesticide Formulators Association).</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Appellees are 13 large firms engaged in the development and marketing of chemicals used to manufacture pesticides. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="576">Page 473 U. S. 576</a></p><p>  Each has in the past submitted data to EPA in support of registrations of various pesticides.  When the 1978 amendments went into effect, these firms were engaged in litigation in the Southern District of New York challenging the constitutionality under Article I and the Fifth Amendment of the provisions authorizing data-sharing and disclosure of data to the public. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In response to this Court\'s decision in <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U. S. 50</a></span> (1982), appellees amended their complaint to allege that the statutory mechanism of binding arbitration for determining the amount of compensation due them violates Article III of the Constitution.  Article III, \xc2\xa7 1, provides that "[t]he judicial Power of the United States, shall be vested" in courts whose judges enjoy tenure "during good Behaviour" and compensation that "shall not be diminished during their Continuance in Office."  Appellees allege Congress, in FIFRA, transgressed this limitation by allocating to arbitrators the functions of judicial officers and severely limiting review by an Article III court.</p>\n<p>The District Court granted appellees\' motion for summary judgment on their Article III claims.  It found the issues ripe because the "statutory compulsion to seek relief through arbitration" raised a constitutionally sufficient case or controversy. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="577">Page 473 U. S. 577</a></p><p>  Although troubled by what appeared a "standardless delegation of powers," the District Court did not reach the Article I issue because it held that Article III barred FIFRA\'s "absolute assignment of [judicial] power" to arbitrators with only limited review by Article III judges.  <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. v. Ruckelshaus,</em> 571 F.Supp. 117, 124 (1983).  The District Court, rather than striking down the statutory limitation on judicial review, enjoined the entire FIFRA data use and compensation scheme.  App. to Juris. Statement 25a.</p>\n<p>Appellant took a direct appeal to this Court pursuant to 28 U. S.C. \xc2\xa7 1252.  We vacated the judgment of the District Court and remanded for reconsideration in light of our supervening decision in <em>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html">467 U. S. 986</a></span> (1984).  <em>Ruckelshaus v. Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co.,</em> 468 U.S. 1201 (1984).  In <em>Monsanto,</em> we ruled that FIFRA\'s data-consideration provisions may be deemed a "public use" even though the most direct beneficiaries of the regulatory scheme will be the later applicants.  467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1014">467 U. S. 1014</a></span>.  Insofar as FIFRA authorizes the Administrator to consider trade secrets submitted during the period between 1972 and 1978, a period during which the registrant entertained a reasonable, investment-backed expectation that its trade secret data would be held confidential, we held it effects a taking.  But the data originator must complete arbitration and, in the event of a shortfall, exhaust its Tucker Act remedies against the United States before it can be ascertained whether it has been deprived of just compensation.  The Court distinguished between the "ability to vindicate [the] constitutional right to just compensation" and the "ability to vindicate [the] statutory right to obtain compensation from a subsequent applicant."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1019">467 U.

But we declined to reach Monsanto\'s Article III claim, explaining:</p>\n<p>"Monsanto did not allege or establish that it had been injured by actual arbitration under the statute.  While the District Court acknowledged that Monsanto had received </p><p><a class="page-number" name="578">Page 473 U.

Further, Monsanto and any subsequent applicant may negotiate and reach agreement concerning an outstanding offer.  If they do not reach agreement, then the controversy must go to arbitration.  Only after EPA has considered data submitted by Monsanto in evaluating another application and an arbitrator has made an award will Monsanto\'s claims with respect to the constitutionality of the arbitration scheme become ripe."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> (citation omitted).  On remand in this case, appellees amended their complaint to reflect that EPA had, in fact, considered their data in support of other registration applications.  The amended complaint also alleged that data submitted by appellee Stauffer Chemical Company (Stauffer), originator of the chemicals butylate and EPTC, had been used in connection with registrations by PPG Industries, Inc. (PPG), and Drexel Chemical Company of pesticides containing butylate and EPTC as active ingredients.  App. 23.  The complaint further alleged Stauffer had invoked the arbitration provisions of \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) against PPG, and appellees entered in evidence the award of the arbitration panel, handed down on June 28, 1983.  <em>Id.</em> at 42.  Stauffer claimed the arbitrators\' award fell far short of the compensation to which it was entitled. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 473 U.

Statement 1a-4a.  The District Court reinstated its prior judgment enjoining the operation of the data-consideration provisions as violative of Article III.  EPA again took a direct appeal, and we noted probable jurisdiction.  469 U.S. 1032 (1984).  This Court stayed the judgment pending disposition of the appeal.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>As a threshold matter, we must determine whether appellees\' Article III claims demonstrate sufficient ripeness to establish a concrete case or controversy.  <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html">419 U.

Appellant contends that the District Court erred in addressing these claims because the criteria established in <em>Monsanto</em> for ripeness remained unsatisfied.  Appellant argues that only one firm, Stauffer, engaged in arbitration, and it seeks to enforce, rather than challenge, the award.  Appellees counter that they are aggrieved by the threat of an unconstitutional arbitration procedure which assigns the valuation of their data to civil arbitrators and prohibits judicial review of the amount of compensation.  Stauffer in particular argues that it was doubly injured by the arbitration.  Although it claimed a shortfall of some $50 million, it was precluded by \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) from seeking judicial review of the award against PPG.  While seeking to enforce the award should its Article III claim fail, Stauffer has consistently challenged the validity of the entire FIFRA data-consideration scheme both here and in litigation initiated by PPG.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F3" name="T3">n</a> 3, <em>supra.</em></p>\n<p>We agree that Stauffer has an independent right to adjudication in a constitutionally proper forum.  <em><span class="l-see">See <a href="/cases/federal/us/370/530/case.html">Glidden Co. </a></span></em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="580">Page 473 U.

Although appellees contend and the District Court found that they were injured by the shortfall in the award, it is sufficient, for purposes of a claim under Article III challenging a tribunal\'s jurisdiction, that the claimant demonstrate it has been or inevitably will be subjected to an exercise of such unconstitutional jurisdiction.  <em>See Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

In contrast to the Taking Clause claim in <em>Monsanto,</em> appellees\' Article III injury is not a function of whether the tribunal awards reasonable compensation, but of the tribunal\'s authority to adjudicate the dispute.  <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co., supra; Glidden Co. v. Zdanok, supra.</em>  Thus, appellees state an independent claim under Article III, apart from any monetary injury sustained as a result of the arbitration.</p>\n<p>"[R]ipeness is peculiarly a question of timing."  <em>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/419/102/case.html#140">419 U.

The Article III challenge in <em>Monsanto</em> was, in this sense, premature.  Monsanto had not alleged that its data had ever been considered in support of other registrations, much less that Monsanto had failed to reach a negotiated settlement or been forced to resort to an unconstitutional arbitration.  In fact, no FIFRA arbitrations had as yet taken place when Monsanto brought its claim.  Monsanto\'s claim thus involved "contingent future events that may not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 473 U. S. 581</a></p><p> occur as anticipated, or indeed may not occur at all."  13A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa7 3532 (1984).  By contrast, the FIFRA data-consideration procedures are now in place, and numerous follow-on registrations have been issued.  <em>See</em> Brief for Appellees 3, n. 3 (citing Docket Entry No. 132, p. 2).  Each of the appellees in this action has alleged as yet uncompensated use of its data.  App. 23.  Stauffer has engaged in an arbitration lasting many months and consuming 2,700 pages of transcript.  There is no doubt that the "effects [of the arbitration scheme] have [been felt by Stauffer] in a concrete way."  <em>Abbott Laboratories v. Gardner,</em> 387 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/387/136/case.html#148">387 U.

At a minimum Stauffer, and arguably each appellee whose data have been used pursuant to the challenged scheme, suffers the continuing uncertainty and expense of depending for compensation on a process whose authority is undermined because its constitutionality is in question.  <em>See ibid.</em></p>\n<p>"\'One does not have to await the consummation of threatened injury to obtain preventive relief.

They allege an injury from EPA\'s unlawful conduct -- the injury of being forced to choose between relinquishing any right to compensation from a follow-on registrant or engaging in an unconstitutional adjudication.  <em>Allen v. Wright,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html">468 U. S. 737</a></span> (1984).  Appellees also allege injury which is likely to be redressed by the relief they request.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The use, registration, and compensation scheme is integrated in a single subsection that explicitly ties the follow-on registration to the arbitration.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) (EPA "shall deny" or "cancel" follow-on registration if arbitration section is not complied with).  It is evident that Congress linked EPA\'s authority to issue follow-on registrations to the original data submitter\'s ability to obtain compensation.  A decision against the provision\'s constitutionality, therefore, would support remedies such as striking down the statutory restrictions on judicial review or enjoining EPA from issuing or retaining in force follow-on registrations pursuant to \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii).</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Appellees contend that Article III bars Congress from requiring arbitration of disputes among registrants concerning compensation under FIFRA without also affording substantial review by tenured judges of the arbitrator\'s decision.  Article III, \xc2\xa7 1, establishes a broad policy that federal judicial power shall be vested in courts whose judges enjoy life tenure and fixed compensation.  These requirements protect </p><p><a class="page-number" name="583">Page 473 U.

Instead, the Court has long recognized that Congress is not barred from acting pursuant to its powers under Article I to vest decisionmaking authority in tribunals that lack the attributes of Article III courts.  <em>See, e.g., Walters v.

Any right to compensation from follow-on registrants under \xc2\xa7 3 (c)(1)(D)(ii) for EPA\'s use of data results from FIFRA, and does not depend on or replace a right to such compensation under state law.  <em>Cf.

As a matter of state law, property rights in a trade secret are extinguished when a company discloses its trade secret to persons not obligated to protect the confidentiality of the information.  <em>See Ruckelshaus v.

Therefore registrants who submit data with notice of the scheme established by the 1978 amendments, and its qualified protection of trade secrets as defined in \xc2\xa7 10, can claim no property interest under state law in data subject to \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii).  <em>Ruckelshaus v.

Nor do individuals who submitted data prior to 1978 have a right to compensation under FIFRA that depends on state law.  To be sure, such users might have a claim that the new scheme results in a taking of property interests protected by state law.  <em>See</em> 467 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/986/case.html#1013">467 U.

For purposes of compensation under FIFRA\'s regulatory scheme, however, it is the "mandatory licensing provision" that creates the relationship between the data submitter and the follow-on registrant, and federal law supplies the rule of decision.  <em>Cf.

The extent of judicial review afforded by the legislation reviewed in <em>Crowell</em> does not constitute a minimal requirement of Article III without regard to the origin of the right at issue or the concerns guiding the selection by Congress of a particular method for resolving disputes.  In assessing the degree of judicial involvement required by Article III in this case, we note that the statute considered in <em>Crowell</em> is different from FIFRA in significant respects.  Most importantly, the statute in <em>Crowell</em> displaced a traditional cause of action and affected a preexisting relationship based on a common law contract for hire.  Thus, it clearly fell within the range of matters reserved to Article III courts under the holding of <em>Northern Pipeline.</em> <em>See</em> 458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html#70">458 U.

These proceedings surely determine liabilities of individuals.  Such schemes would be beyond the power of Congress under appellees\' interpretation of <em>Crowell.</em>  In essence, the public rights doctrine reflects simply a pragmatic understanding that, when Congress selects a quasi-judicial method of resolving matters that "could be conclusively determined by the Executive and Legislative Branches," the danger of encroaching on the judicial powers is reduced.  <em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v.

First, the right created by FIFRA is not a purely "private" right, but bears many of the characteristics of a "public" right.  Use of a registrant\'s data to support a follow-on registration serves a public purpose as an integral part of a program safeguarding the public health.  Congress has the power, under Article I, to authorize an agency administering a complex regulatory scheme to allocate costs and benefits among voluntary participants in the program without providing an Article III adjudication.  It also has the power to condition issuance of registrations or licenses on compliance with agency procedures.  Article III is not so inflexible that it bars Congress from shifting the task of data valuation from the agency to the interested parties.  <em>Cf. United States v. Erika, Inc.,</em> 456 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/456/201/case.html#203">456 U.

S. 590</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The 1978 amendments represent a pragmatic solution to the difficult problem of spreading the costs of generating adequate information regarding the safety, health, and environmental impact of a potentially dangerous product.  Congress, without implicating Article III, could have authorized EPA to charge follow-on registrants fees to cover the cost of data, and could have directly subsidized FIFRA data submitters for their contributions of needed data.  <em>See St. Joseph Stockyards Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/298/38/case.html">298 U.

Instead, it selected a framework that collapses these two steps into one, and permits the parties to fix the amount of compensation, with binding arbitration to resolve intractable disputes.  Removing the task of valuation from agency personnel to civilian arbitrators, selected by agreement of the parties or appointed on a case-by-case basis by an independent federal agency, surely does not diminish the likelihood of impartial decisionmaking, free from political influence.  <em>See</em> 29 CFR \xc2\xa7 1404.4, pt. 1440, App. \xc2\xa7 7 (1984).  <em>Cf.

The danger of Congress or the Executive encroaching on the Article III judicial powers is at a minimum when no unwilling defendant is subjected to judicial enforcement power as a result of the agency "adjudication."  <em>See, e.g.,</em> Hart, The Power of Congress to Limit the Jurisdiction of Federal Courts:  An Exercise in Dialectic, 66 Harv.L.Rev. 1362 (1953), reprinted in P.

We conclude that, in the circumstances, the review afforded preserves the "appropriate exercise of the judicial function."  <em>Crowell v.

FIFRA, at a minimum, allows private parties to secure Article III review of the arbitrator\'s "findings and determination" for fraud, misconduct, or misrepresentation.  \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii).  This provision protects against arbitrators who abuse or exceed their powers or willfully misconstrue their mandate under the governing law.  <em>Cf. Steelworkers v.

United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/295/495/case.html">295 U. S. 495</a></span> (1935).

Although FIFRA\'s language does not impose an explicit standard, the legislative history of the 1972 and 1978 amendments is far from silent.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> S.Conf.Rep.

The Article I claim, however, was neither adequately briefed nor argued to this Court, and was not fully litigated before the District Court.  Without expressing any opinion on the merits, we leave the issue open for determination on remand.</p>\n<p></p><h3>V</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our holding is limited to the proposition that Congress, acting for a valid legislative purpose pursuant to its constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="594">Page 473 U.

To hold otherwise would be to erect a rigid and formalistic restraint on the ability of Congress to adopt innovative measures such as negotiation and arbitration with respect to rights created by a regulatory scheme.  For the reasons stated in our opinion, we hold that arbitration of the limited right created by FIFRA \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) does not contravene Article III.

The terms and amount of compensation may be fixed by agreement between the original data submitter and the applicant, or, failing such an agreement, binding arbitration under this subparagraph.  If, at the end of ninety days after the date of delivery to the original data submitter of the offer to compensate, the original data submitter and the applicant, have neither agreed on the amount and terms of compensation nor on a procedure for reaching an agreement on the amount and terms of compensation, either person may initiate binding arbitration proceedings by requesting the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service to appoint an arbitrator from the roster of arbitrators maintained by such Service.

III, \xc2\xa7 1.  We know that those who framed our Constitution feared the tyranny of "accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands," The Federalist No. 47, p. 300 (H. Lodge ed. 1888) (J. Madison), and sought to guard against it by dispersing federal power to three interdependent branches of Government.  Each branch of Government was intended to exercise a distinct but limited power, and function as a check on any aggrandizing tendencies in the other branches.  <em>See Buckley v.

It is thus clear that, when Congress establishes courts pursuant to Art. III, the judges presiding in those courts must receive salary and tenure guarantees.  The difficult question is to what extent the need to preserve the Judiciary\'s checking function requires Congress to assign the Federal Government\'s decisionmaking authority to independent tribunals so constituted.</p>\n<p><em>Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U. S. 50</a></span> (1982), is the Court\'s most recent attempt at defining the limits Art. III places on the power of Congress to assign adjudicative authority to decisionmakers not protected by tenure and salary guarantees.  We faced the question whether, under the federal Bankruptcy Act of 1978, 92 Stat. 2549, a federal bankruptcy court whose decisionmaker did not benefit from those guarantees could be empowered to render the entire initial adjudication of a state common law cause of action.  The issue was, in other words, whether Art. III permitted assignment of any essential attributes of the "judicial Power" to a non-Art. III federal decisionmaker when state law prescribed the rule of decision in a dispute between private parties.  The Court invalidated the congressional action, but a majority did not agree upon a common rationale.  The plurality would have held that this allocation of decisional authority could not be justified as a proper exercise of either the congressional power to create Art. I legislative courts or the congressional power to create adjuncts to Art. III courts.  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html#63">458 U.

JUSTICE REHNQUIST, in a concurring opinion joined by JUSTICE O\'CONNOR, would simply have held that Congress may not assign the power to adjudicate a traditional state common law action to a non-Art.

The plurality concluded that, notwithstanding the commands of Art.

The dispute at issue in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> was found by the plurality not to fall into the public rights category, because state law created the right and provided the rule of decision as between the private parties litigating the dispute, irrespective of the existence of the federal bankruptcy scheme.  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html#72">458 U.

In no sense could the dispute be said to be about the propriety or accuracy of a determination made by an organ of the Federal Government in administration or execution of a federal regulatory scheme.  Whatever the precise scope of the public rights doctrine, that case was clearly outside it, and therefore adjudication before an Art. III decisionmaker or properly constituted adjunct was required.

Thus, the question for decision here is whether fixing the amount of compensation for test data under FIFRA can be characterized as a public rights dispute that need not be adjudicated from the outset in an Art. III court or a properly constituted adjunct to such a court. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Should it be concluded that this is such a dispute, the further issue must be confronted of whether some form of appellate oversight by an Art.

Despite the Court\'s contrary suggestions, the plurality opinion in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> suggests neither that "the right to an Article III forum is absolute unless the Federal Government is a party of record" nor that "Article III has no force simply because a dispute is between the Government and an individual." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="599">Page 473 U.

Properly understood, the analysis elaborated by the plurality in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> does not place the Federal Government in an Art. III straitjacket whenever a dispute technically is one between private parties.  We recognized that a bankruptcy adjudication, though technically a dispute among private parties, may well be properly characterized as a matter of public rights.  458 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/50/case.html">458 U.

Benson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html">285 U. S. 22</a></span> (1932), similarly suggests that a proper interpretation of Art.

The plurality opinion should not be read to imply that reliance on administrative agencies for ratemaking or other forms of regulatory adjustments of private interests is necessarily suspect.  <em>Cf.

Also, the plurality opinion was careful to leave open the question whether and to what extent even the resolution of public rights disputes might require some eventual review in an Art.

Because the approach of the plurality opinion in <em>Northern Pipeline</em> is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the demands of contemporary Government while preserving the constitutional system of checks and balances, I adhere to it as the proper analysis for resolving the present case.</p>\n<p>Though the issue before us in this case is not free of doubt, in my judgment, the FIFRA compensation scheme challenged in this case should be viewed as involving a matter of public rights as that term is understood in the line of cases culminating in <em>Northern Pipeline.</em>  In one sense, the question of proper compensation for a follow-on registrant\'s use of test data is, under the FIFRA scheme, a dispute about "the liability of one individual to another under the law as defined," <em>Crowell v. Benson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html#51">285 U. S. 51</a></span> (defining matters of private right).  But the dispute arises in the context of a federal regulatory scheme that virtually occupies the field.  Congress has decided that effectuation of the public policies of FIFRA demands not only a requirement of compensation from "follow-on" registrants in return for mandatory access to data, but also an administrative process -- mandatory negotiation followed by binding arbitration -- to ensure that unresolved compensation disputes do not delay public distribution of needed products.  This case, in other words, involves not only the congressional prescription of a federal rule of decision to govern a private dispute, but also the active participation of a federal regulatory agency in resolving the dispute.  Although a compensation dispute under FIFRA ultimately involves a determination of the duty owed one private party by another, at its heart, the dispute involves the exercise of authority by a Federal Government arbitrator in the course of administration of FIFRA\'s comprehensive regulatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="601">Page 473 U. S. 601</a></p><p> scheme.  As such, it partakes of the characteristics of a standard agency adjudication.  <em>Cf. Leedom v. Kyne, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/358/184/case.html#191">358 U. S. 191</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., dissenting). [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Given that this dispute is properly understood as one involving a matter in which Congress has substantial latitude to make use of Art. I decisionmakers, the question remains whether the Constitution nevertheless imposes some requirement of Art. III supervision of the arbitrator\'s decisions under this scheme.  In this case, Congress has provided for review of arbitrators\' decisions to ensure against "fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct."  The Court therefore need not reach the difficult question whether Congress is always free to cut off all judicial review of decisions respecting such exercises of Art. I authority.</p>\n<p>The review prescribed under FIFRA encompasses the authority to invalidate an arbitrator\'s decision when that decision exceeds the arbitrator\'s authority or exhibits a manifest disregard for the governing law.  <em>See Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel &amp; Car Corp.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/593/case.html">363 U. S. 593</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/363/593/case.html#597">363 U. S. 597</a></span> (1960); <em>Wilko v.

S. 436</a></span>-437 (1953).  Such review preserves the judicial authority over questions of law in the present context.  <em>Cf. Crowell v. Benson, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/case.html#54">285 U. S. 54</a></span>.  In essence, the FIFRA scheme delegates a significant case-</p>\n<p>1473 U.S. 602</p>\n<p>by-case lawmaking function to the arbitrator in compensation disputes.  So long as this delegation is constitutionally permissible -- an issue left open on remand -- and judicial review to ensure that the arbitrator\'s exercise of authority in any given case does not depart from the mandate of the delegation, the Judiciary will exercise a restraining authority sufficient to meet whatever requirements Art. III might impose in the present context. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>For these reasons, I agree with the Court that the FIFRA arbitration scheme does not violate the mandates of Art. III, and I would therefore reverse the judgment of the District Court and remand for further proceedings. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="602">Page 473 U.

In this regard, it is worth noting that early cases recognizing a public rights doctrine typically involved either challenges to Government action affecting private interests in which at the time no constitutional claim of entitlement was recognized, <em>e.g., United States v. Babcock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/328/case.html">250 U.

I courts.</p>\n<p>The underpinnings of the original theory, of course, have not survived intact.  We now recognize an entitlement in certain forms of government assistance.  <em>Goldberg v. Kelly,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/254/case.html">397 U. S. 254</a></span> (1970).

Loudermill,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/532/case.html">470 U. S. 532</a></span> (1985).

The erosion of these underpinnings does not, however, mandate the conclusion that disputes arising in the administration of federal regulatory programs may not be resolved through Art.

It may rather be that the exercise of the Court\'s power of judicial review to ensure constitutionality is what restrains the exercise of legislative power.  The power to interpret federal statutory law could be seen as acting as a check on the exercise of the executive power -- or the power of administrative agencies whether or not they are considered as under the head of executive authority -- given that what courts do when they review agency action, both rulemaking and adjudication, is ensure that the reviewed action has not departed from congressional intent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/5" name="F2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]</p>\n<p>It is also important to note that the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment imposes, as the Court correctly notes, independent constraints on the ability of Congress to establish particular forums for dispute resolution under Art.

Because \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) does not give appellees any legal basis for claiming that they have been harmed by anything EPA did or threatened to do, a decision that FIFRA\'s arbitration provisions violate Article III could not support an injunction against the Administrator\'s use of appellees\' data.  Accordingly, appellees do not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) in this action. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  For this reason, I agree that the judgment of the District Court must be reversed.\n</em></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The text of \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) is quoted in full <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/568/case.html#574">473 U. S. 574</a></span>-575, n. 1.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/2" name="F3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Under appellees\' reading of \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(ii), compensation is a condition precedent to EPA\'s use of their research data to evaluate applications by third parties.  <em>See</em> Amended Complaint for Declaratory Judgment and Injunction \xef\xbf\xbd 20, App. 23.  Because the statutorily required arbitration procedure violates Article III, they reason, compensation cannot be awarded and the condition precedent to EPA\'s use of data cannot be fulfilled.  Ergo, an injunction must issue against the agency.</p>\n<p>Appellees, however, misread the statute.  Section 3(c)(1)(D)(ii) conditions the Administrator\'s use of their data on a third party\'s "<em>offer</em> to compensate," not upon actual compensation.  92 Stat. 821, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii) (emphasis added); <em>accord,</em> \xc2\xa7 3(c)(1)(D)(iii), 92 Stat. 822, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136a(c)(1)(D)(iii).  Indeed, the same section later provides that "[r]egistration action by the Administrator shall not be delayed pending the fixing of compensation."  92 Stat. 822, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii).  A straightforward reading of this section demonstrates that EPA is not disabled from using research data to process "follow-on" registrations pending compensation of appellees.  I find nothing in the legislative history that contradicts this interpretation, and it is consistent with Congress\' "vie[w] [of] data-sharing as essential to the registration scheme," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/568/case.html#573">473 U. S. 573</a></span>, and with the Legislature\'s consequent desire to break "the <em>logjam of litigation that resulted from controversies over data compensation and trade secret protection,\'" <em>ibid.</em> (quoting S.Rep. No. 95-334, P. 3 (1977)).  <em>See id.</em> at 3 ("The single largest problem is the fact that the registration and reregistration process has ground to a virtual halt. . . .  Since registration is critical, this program must be made to work").  Congress surely desired both that EPA have use of appellees\' data and that appellees be compensated for such use.  But there is no evidence to indicate that Congress intended these complementary provisions to be mutually dependent.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 30, 92 Stat. 836, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136x ("If any provision of this [Act] . . . is held invalid, the invalidity shall not affect other provisions . . . which can be given effect without regard to the invalid provision . . . and to this end the provisions of this [Act] are severable"); <em>cf. INS v. Chadha,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html">462 U. S. 919</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/case.html#931">462 U. S. 931</a></span>-935 (1983).\n</em></p>\n<p>The sentence the Court believes "ties the follow-on registration to the arbitration," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/473/568/case.html#582">473 U. S. 582</a></span>, is beside the point.  Section 3(C)(1)(D)(ii) requires the Administrator to "deny the application or cancel the registration of the pesticide" if the third-party "follow-on" applicant</p>\n<p>"has failed to participate in a procedure for reaching an agreement or in an arbitration proceeding as required by this subparagraph, or failed to comply with the terms of an agreement or arbitration decision concerning compensation."</p>\n<p>92 Stat. 821, 7 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 136a(c)(1)(D)(ii).  This sentence is obviously addressed to defaults by third-party "follow-on" applicants in the registration process, and hardly suggests that Congress would have scrapped the entire data-use provision if the compensation component was found unconstitutional.  To restate the obvious, Congress undoubtedly intended that EPA have use of original applicants\' research data, <em>and</em> that such use be recompensed -- the statute, after all, provides for both.  But the Legislature\'s unequivocal intention to facilitate pesticide registrations, and the presence of an express severability provision (accompanied by the traditional duty "to save and not to destroy," <em>Tilton v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html">403 U. S. 672</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html#684">403 U. S. 684</a></span> (1971)), makes it rather unlikely that Congress gambled the entire pesticide registration process on the constitutionality of a provision for arbitrable compensation.  I therefore conclude that, even if we invalidated the compensation clauses, appellees would have no right to an injunction against EPA\'s use of appellees\' research data.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/3" name="F3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court held that appellees had standing to challenge FIFRA\'s arbitration provisions because "plaintiffs\' injuries here would be the direct product of the statutory plan."  <em>Union Carbide Agricultural Products Co. v. Ruckelshaus,</em> 571 F.Supp. 117, 123, n. 2 (SDNY 1983).  This analysis is incomplete:  "The injury must be <em>fairly\' traceable to the challenged action, <em>and</em> relief from the injury must be `likely\' to follow from a favorable decision."  <em>Allen v. Wright,</em> 468 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/737/case.html#751">468 U. S. 751</a></span> (emphasis added); <em>accord, Valley Forge Christian College v.

These two components of the Article III causation requirement are distinct:  the "fairly traceable" component "examines the causal connection between the assertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury"; the "redressability" component "examines the causal connection between the alleged injury and the judicial relief requested."  <em>Allen v.
