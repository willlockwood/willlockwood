JUSTICE BLACK delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The respondent Board of Education of Union Free School District No. 9, New Hyde Park, New York, acting in its official capacity under state law, directed the School District\'s principal to cause the following prayer to be said aloud by each class in the presence of a teacher at the beginning of each school day:</p>\n<p>"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country."</p>\n<p>This daily procedure was adopted on the recommendation of the State Board of Regents, a governmental agency created by the State Constitution to which the New York Legislature has granted broad supervisory, executive, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="423">Page 370 U. S. 423</a></p><p> legislative powers over the State\'s public school system. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  These state officials composed the prayer which they recommended and published as a part of their "Statement on Moral and Spiritual Training in the Schools," saying:</p>\n<p>"We believe that this Statement will be subscribed to by all men and women of good will, and we call upon all of them to aid in giving life to our program."</p>\n<p>Shortly after the practice of reciting the Regents\' prayer was adopted by the School District, the parents of ten pupils brought this action in a New York State Court insisting that use of this official prayer in the public schools was contrary to the beliefs, religions, or religious practices of both themselves and their children.  Among other things, these parents challenged the constitutionality of both the state law authorizing the School District to direct the use of prayer in public schools and the School District\'s regulation ordering the recitation of this particular prayer on the ground that these actions of official governmental agencies violate that part of the First Amendment of the Federal Constitution which commands that "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion" -- a command which was "made applicable to the State of New York by the Fourteenth Amendment of the said Constitution."  The New York Court of Appeals, over the dissents of Judges Dye and Fuld, sustained an order of the lower state courts which had upheld the power of New York to use the Regents\' prayer as a part of the daily procedures of its public schools so long as the schools did not compel any pupil to join in the prayer over his or his parents\' objection. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="424">Page 370 U. S. 424</a></p><p> We granted certiorari to review this important decision involving rights protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>We think that, by using its public school system to encourage recitation of the Regents\' prayer, the State of New York has adopted a practice wholly inconsistent with the Establishment Clause.  There can, of course, be no doubt that New York\'s program of daily classroom invocation of God\'s blessings as prescribed in the Regents\' prayer is a religious activity.  It is a solemn avowal of divine faith and supplication for the blessings of the Almighty.  The nature of such a prayer has always been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="425">Page 370 U. S. 425</a></p><p> religious, none of the respondents has denied this, and the trial court expressly so found:</p>\n<p>"The religious nature of prayer was recognized by Jefferson, and has been concurred in by theological writers, the United States Supreme Court, and State courts and administrative officials, including New York\'s Commissioner of Education.  A committee of the New York Legislature has agreed."</p>\n<p>"The Board of Regents as <em>amicus curiae,</em> the respondents, and intervenors all concede the religious nature of prayer, but seek to distinguish this prayer because it is based on our spiritual heritage. . . . [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]"</p>\n<p>The petitioners contend, among other things, that the state laws requiring or permitting use of the Regents\' prayer must be struck down as a violation of the Establishment Clause because that prayer was composed by governmental officials as a part of a governmental program to further religious beliefs.  For this reason, petitioners argue, the State\'s use of the Regents\' prayer in its public school system breaches the constitutional wall of separation between Church and State.  We agree with that contention, since we think that the constitutional prohibition against laws respecting an establishment of religion must at least mean that, in this country, it is no part of the business of government to compose official prayers for any group of the American people to recite as a part of a religious program carried on by government.</p>\n<p>It is a matter of history that this very practice of establishing governmentally composed prayers for religious services was one of the reasons which caused many of our early colonists to leave England and seek religious freedom in America.  The Book of Common Prayer, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 370 U. S. 426</a></p><p> which was created under governmental direction and which was approved by Acts of Parliament in 1548 and 1549, [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] set out in minute detail the accepted form and content of prayer and other religious ceremonies to be used in the established, tax supported Church of England. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The controversies over the Book and what should be its content repeatedly threatened to disrupt the peace of that country as the accepted forms of prayer in the established church changed with the views of the particular ruler that happened to be in control at the time. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  Powerful groups representing some of the varying religious views of the people struggled among themselves to impress their particular views upon the Government and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="427">Page 370 U. S. 427</a></p><p> obtain amendments of the Book more suitable to their respective notions of how religious services should be conducted in order that the official religious establishment would advance their particular religious beliefs. [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  Other groups, lacking the necessary political power to influence the Government on the matter, decided to leave England and its established church and seek freedom in America from England\'s governmentally ordained and supported religion.</p>\n<p>It is an unfortunate fact of history that, when some of the very groups which had most strenuously opposed the established Church of England found themselves sufficiently in control of colonial governments in this country to write their own prayers into law, they passed laws making their own religion the official religion of their respective colonies. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Indeed, as late as the time of the Revolutionary </p><p><a class="page-number" name="428">Page 370 U. S. 428</a></p><p> War, there were established churches in at least eight of the thirteen former colonies and established religions in at least four of the other five. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  But the successful Revolution against English political domination was shortly followed by intense opposition to the practice of establishing religion by law.  This opposition crystallized rapidly into an effective political force in Virginia, where the minority religious groups such as Presbyterians, Lutherans, Quakers and Baptists had gained such strength that the adherents to the established Episcopal Church were actually a minority themselves.  In 1785-1786, those opposed to the established Church, led by James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who, though themselves not members of any of these dissenting religious groups, opposed all religious establishments by law on grounds of principle, obtained the enactment of the famous "Virginia Bill for Religious Liberty" by which all religious groups were placed on an equal footing so far as the State was concerned. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Similar though less far-reaching </p><p><a class="page-number" name="429">Page 370 U. S. 429</a></p><p> legislation was being considered and passed in other states. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p>By the time of the adoption of the Constitution, our history shows that there was a widespread awareness among many Americans of the dangers of a union of Church and State.  These people knew, some of them from bitter personal experience, that one of the greatest dangers to the freedom of the individual to worship in his own way lay in the Government\'s placing its official stamp of approval upon one particular kind of prayer or one particular form of religious services.  They knew the anguish, hardship and bitter strife that could come when zealous religious groups struggled with one another to obtain the Government\'s stamp of approval from each King, Queen, or Protector that came to temporary power.  The Constitution was intended to avert a part of this danger by leaving the government of this country in the hands of the people, rather than in the hands of any monarch.  But this safeguard was not enough.  Our Founders were no more willing to let the content of their prayers and their privilege of praying whenever they pleased be influenced by the ballot box than they were to let these vital matters of personal conscience depend upon the succession of monarchs.  The First Amendment was added to the Constitution to stand as a guarantee that neither the power nor the prestige of the Federal Government would be used to control, support or influence the kinds of prayer the American people can say -- </p><p><a class="page-number" name="430">Page 370 U. S. 430</a></p><p> that the people\'s religions must not be subjected to the pressures of government for change each time a new political administration is elected to office.  Under that Amendment\'s prohibition against governmental establishment of religion, as reinforced by the provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment, government in this country, be it state or federal, is without power to prescribe by law any particular form of prayer which is to be used as an official prayer in carrying on any program of governmentally sponsored religious activity.</p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that New York\'s state prayer program officially establishes the religious beliefs embodied in the Regents\' prayer.  The respondents\' argument to the contrary, which is largely based upon the contention that the Regents\' prayer is "nondenominational" and the fact that the program, as modified and approved by state courts, does not require all pupils to recite the prayer, but permits those who wish to do so to remain silent or be excused from the room, ignores the essential nature of the program\'s constitutional defects.  Neither the fact that the prayer may be denominationally neutral nor the fact that its observance on the part of the students is voluntary can serve to free it from the limitations of the Establishment Clause, as it might from the Free Exercise Clause, of the First Amendment, both of which are operative against the States by virtue of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Although these two clauses may, in certain instances, overlap, they forbid two quite different kinds of governmental encroachment upon religious freedom.  The Establishment Clause, unlike the Free Exercise Clause, does not depend upon any showing of direct governmental compulsion and is violated by the enactment of laws which establish an official religion whether those laws operate directly to coerce nonobserving individuals or not.  This is not to say, of course, that </p><p><a class="page-number" name="431">Page 370 U. S. 431</a></p><p> laws officially prescribing a particular form of religious worship do not involve coercion of such individuals.  When the power, prestige and financial support of government is placed behind a particular religious belief, the indirect coercive pressure upon religious minorities to conform to the prevailing officially approved religion is plain.  But the purposes underlying the Establishment Clause go much further than that.  Its first and most immediate purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion tends to destroy government and to degrade religion.  The history of governmentally established religion, both in England and in this country, showed that whenever government had allied itself with one particular form of religion, the inevitable result had been that it had incurred the hatred, disrespect and even contempt of those who held contrary beliefs. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  That same history showed that many people had lost their respect for any religion that had relied upon the support of government to spread its faith. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  The Establishment Clause </p><p><a class="page-number" name="432">Page 370 U. S. 432</a></p><p> thus stands as an expression of principle on the part of the Founders of our Constitution that religion is too personal, too sacred, too holy, to permit its "unhallowed perversion" by a civil magistrate. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  Another purpose of the Establishment Clause rested upon an awareness of the historical fact that governmentally established religions and religious persecutions go hand in hand. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The Founders knew that, only a few years after the Book of Common Prayer became the only accepted form of religious services in the established Church of England, an Act of Uniformity was passed to compel all Englishmen to attend those services and to make it a criminal offense to conduct or attend religious gatherings of any other kind [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] -- a law </p><p><a class="page-number" name="433">Page 370 U. S. 433</a></p><p> which was consistently flouted by dissenting religious groups in England and which contributed to widespread persecutions of people like John Bunyan who persisted in holding "unlawful [religious] meetings . . . to the great disturbance and distraction of the good subjects of this kingdom. . . ." [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]  And they knew that similar persecutions had received the sanction of law in several of the colonies in this country soon after the establishment of official religions in those colonies. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  It was in large part to get completely away from this sort of systematic religious persecution that the Founders brought into being our Nation, our Constitution, and our Bill of Rights, with its prohibition against any governmental establishment of religion.  The New York laws officially prescribing the Regents\' prayer are inconsistent both with the purposes of the Establishment Clause and with the Establishment Clause itself.</p>\n<p>It has been argued that to apply the Constitution in such a way as to prohibit state laws respecting an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 370 U. S. 434</a></p><p> establishment of religious services in public schools is to indicate a hostility toward religion or toward prayer.  Nothing, of course, could be more wrong.  The history of man is inseparable from the history of religion.  And perhaps it is not too much to say that, since the beginning of that history, many people have devoutly believed that "More things are wrought by prayer than this world dreams of."  It was doubtless largely due to men who believed this that there grew up a sentiment that caused men to leave the cross-currents of officially established state religions and religious persecution in Europe and come to this country filled with the hope that they could find a place in which they could pray when they pleased to the God of their faith in the language they chose. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  And there were men of this same faith in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 370 U. S. 435</a></p><p> power of prayer who led the fight for adoption of our Constitution and also for our Bill of Rights with the very guarantees of religious freedom that forbid the sort of governmental activity which New York has attempted here.  These men knew that the First Amendment, which tried to put an end to governmental control of religion and of prayer, was not written to destroy either.  They knew, rather, that it was written to quiet well justified fears which nearly all of them felt arising out of an awareness that governments of the past had shackled men\'s tongues to make them speak only the religious thoughts that government wanted them to speak and to pray only to the God that government wanted them to pray to.  It is neither sacrilegious nor anti-religious to say that each separate government in this country should stay out of the business of writing or sanctioning official prayers and leave that purely religious function to the people themselves and to those the people choose to look to for religious guidance. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 370 U. S. 436</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It is true that New York\'s establishment of its Regents\' prayer as an officially approved religious doctrine of that State does not amount to a total establishment of one particular religious sect to the exclusion of all others -- that, indeed, the governmental endorsement of that prayer seems relatively insignificant when compared to the governmental encroachments upon religion which were commonplace 200 years ago.  To those who may subscribe to the view that, because the Regents\' official prayer is so brief and general there can be no danger to religious freedom in its governmental establishment, however, it may be appropriate to say in the words of James Madison, the author of the First Amendment:</p>\n<p>"[I]t is proper to take alarm at the first experiment on our liberties. . . .  Who does not see that the same authority which can establish Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion of all other Sects?  That the same authority which can force a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the support of any one establishment may force him to conform to any other establishment in all cases whatsoever? [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]"</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Court of Appeals of New York is reversed, and the cause remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and remanded.</em></p>\n<p>MR.

The trial court\'s opinion, which is reported at 18 Misc.2d 659, 191 N.Y.S.2d 453, had made it clear that the Board of Education must set up some sort of procedures to protect those who objected to reciting the prayer:</p>\n<p>"This is not to say that the rights accorded petitioners and their children under the \'free exercise\' clause do not mandate safeguards against such embarrassments and pressures.  It is enough on this score, however, that regulations, such as were adopted by New York City\'s Board of Education in connection with its released time program, be adopted, making clear that neither teachers nor any other school authority may comment on participation or nonparticipation in the exercise nor suggest or require that any posture or language be used or dress be worn or be not used or not worn.  Nonparticipation may take the form either of remaining silent during the exercise, or, if the parent or child so desires, of being excused entirely from the exercise.  Such regulations must also make provision for those nonparticipants who are to be excused from the prayer exercise.  The exact provision to be made is a matter for decision by the board, rather than the court, within the framework of constitutional requirements.  Within that framework would fall a provision that prayer participants proceed to a common assembly while nonparticipants attend other rooms, or that nonparticipants be permitted to arrive at school a few minutes late or to attend separate opening exercises, or any other method which treats with equality both participants and nonparticipants."</p>\n<p>18 Misc.2d at 696, 191 N.Y.S.2d at 492-493.  <em>See also</em> the opinion of the Appellate Division affirming that of the trial court, reported at 11 App.Div.2d 340, 206 N.Y.S.2d 183.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>368 U.S. 924.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>18 Mis. .2d at 671-672, 191 N.Y.S.2d at 468-469.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>2 &amp; 3 Edward VI, c. 1, entitled "An Act for Uniformity of Service and Administration of the Sacraments throughout the Realm"; 3 &amp; 4 Edward VI, c. 10, entitled "An Act for the abolishing and putting away of divers Books and Images."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p>The provisions of the various versions of the Book of Common Prayer are set out in broad outline in the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Vol. 18 (1957 ed.), pp. 420-423.

In 1553, Edward VI died and was succeeded by Mary, who abolished the Book of Common Prayer entirely.  1 Mary, c. 2.  But upon the accession of Elizabeth in 1558, the Book was restored with important alterations from the form it had been given by Edward VI.  1 Elizabeth, c. 2.  The resentment to this amended form of the Book was kept firmly under control during the reign of Elizabeth, but, upon her death in 1603, a petition signed by more than 1,000 Puritan ministers was presented to King James I asking for further alterations in the Book.  Some alterations were made, and the Book retained substantially this form until it was completely suppressed again in 1645 as a result of the successful Puritan Revolution.  Shortly after the restoration in 1660 of Charles II, the Book was again reintroduced, 13 &amp; 14 Charles II, c. 4, and again with alterations.  Rather than accept this form of the Book, some 2,000 Puritan ministers vacated their benefices.  <em>See generally</em> Pullan, The History of the Book of Common Prayer (1900), pp. vii-xvi; Encyclopaedia Britannica (1957 ed.), Vol. 1, pp. 421-422.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T8" name="F8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p>For example, the Puritans twice attempted to modify the Book of Common Prayer, and once attempted to destroy it.  The story of their struggle to modify the Book in the reign of Charles I is vividly summarized in Pullan, History of the Book of Common Prayer, at p. xiii:</p>\n<p>"The King actively supported those members of the Church of England who were anxious to vindicate its Catholic character and maintain the ceremonial which Elizabeth had approved.  Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury, was the leader of this school.  Equally resolute in his opposition to the distinctive tenets of Rome and of Geneva, he enjoyed the hatred of both Jesuit and Calvinist.  He helped the Scottish bishops, who had made large concessions to the uncouth habits of Presbyterian worship, to draw up a Book of Common Prayer for Scotland.  It contained a Communion Office resembling that of the book of 1549.  It came into use in 1637, and met with a bitter and barbarous opposition.  The vigour of the Scottish Protestants strengthened the hands of their English sympathisers.  Laud and Charles were executed, Episcopacy was abolished, the use of the Book of Common Prayer was prohibited."</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T9" name="F9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>For a description of some of the laws enacted by early theocratic governments in New England, <em>see</em> Parrington, Main Currents in American Thought (1930), Vol. 1, pp. 5-50; Whipple, Our Ancient Liberties (1927), pp. 63-78; Wertenbaker, The Puritan Oligarchy (1947).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>The Church of England was the established church of at least five colonies:  Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.

In Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut, the Congregationalist Church was officially established.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring.</p>\n<p>It is customary in deciding a constitutional question to treat it in its narrowest form.  Yet at times the setting of the question gives it a form and content which no abstract treatment could give.  The point for decision is whether the Government can constitutionally finance a religious exercise.  Our system at the federal and state levels is presently honeycombed with such financing. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  Nevertheless, I think it is an unconstitutional undertaking whatever form it takes.</p>\n<p>First, a word as to what this case does not involve. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="438">Page 370 U. S. 438</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Plainly, our Bill of Rights would not permit a State or the Federal Government to adopt an official prayer and penalize anyone who would not utter it.  This, however, is not that case, for there is no element of compulsion or coercion in New York\'s regulation requiring that public schools be opened each day with the following prayer:</p>\n<p>"Almighty God, we acknowledge our dependence upon Thee, and we beg Thy blessings upon us, our parents, our teachers and our Country."</p>\n<p>The prayer is said upon the commencement of the school day, immediately following the pledge of allegiance to the flag.  The prayer is said aloud in the presence of a teacher, who either leads the recitation or selects a student to do so.  No student, however, is compelled to take part.  The respondents have adopted a regulation which provides that</p>\n<p>"Neither teachers nor any school authority shall comment on participation or non-participation . . . , nor suggest or request that any posture or language be used or dress be worn or be not used or not worn."</p>\n<p>Provision is also made for excusing children, upon written request of a parent or guardian, from the saying of the prayer or from the room in which the prayer is said.  A letter implementing and explaining this regulation has been sent to each taxpayer and parent in the school district.  As I read this regulation, a child is free to stand or not stand, to recite or not recite, without fear of reprisal or even comment by the teacher or any other school official.</p>\n<p>In short, the only one who need utter the prayer is the teacher, and no teacher is complaining of it.  Students can stand mute, or even leave the classroom, if they desire. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="439">Page 370 U. S. 439</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>McCollum v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/203/case.html">333 U. S. 203</a></span>, does not decide this case.  It involved the use of public school facilities for religious education of students.  Students either had to attend religious instruction or</p>\n<p>"go to some other place in the school building for pursuit of their secular studies. . . .  Reports of their presence or absence were to be made to their secular teachers."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/333/203/case.html#209">333 U. S. 209</a></span>.  The influence of the teaching staff was therefore brought to bear on the student body to support the instilling of religious principles.  In the present case, school facilities are used to say the prayer, and the teaching staff is employed to lead the pupils in it.  There is, however, no effort at indoctrination, and no attempt at exposition.  Prayers, of course, may be so long and of such a character as to amount to an attempt at the religious instruction that was denied the public schools by the <em>McCollum</em> case.  But New York\'s prayer is of a character that does not involve any element of proselytizing, as in the <em>McCollum</em> case.</p>\n<p>The question presented by this case is therefore an extremely narrow one.  It is whether New York oversteps the bounds when it finances a religious exercise.</p>\n<p>What New York does on the opening of its public schools is what we do when we open court.  Our Crier has from the beginning announced the convening of the Court and then added "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."  That utterance is a supplication, a prayer in which we, the judges, are free to join, but which we need not recite any more than the students need recite the New York prayer.</p>\n<p>What New York does on the opening of its public schools is what each House of Congress [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] does at the opening </p><p><a class="page-number" name="440">Page 370 U. S. 440</a></p><p> of each day\'s business. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  Reverend Frederick B. Harris is Chaplain of the Senate; Reverend Bernard Braskamp is Chaplain of the House.  Guest chaplains of various denominations also officiate. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="441">Page 370 U. S. 441</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In New York, the teacher who leads in prayer is on the public payroll, and the time she takes seems minuscule as compared with the salaries appropriated by state legislatures and Congress for chaplains to conduct prayers in the legislative halls.  Only a bare fraction of the teacher\'s time is given to reciting this short 22-word prayer, about the same amount of time that our Crier spends announcing the opening of our sessions and offering a prayer for this Court.  Yet, for me, the principle is the same, no matter how briefly the prayer is said, for, in each of the instances given, the person praying is a public official on the public payroll, performing a religious exercise in a governmental institution. [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  It is said that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="442">Page 370 U. S. 442</a></p><p> element of coercion is inherent in the giving of this prayer.  If that is true here, it is also true of the prayer with which this Court is convened, and of those  that open the Congress.  Few adults, let alone children, would leave our courtroom or the Senate or the House while those prayers are being given.  Every such audience is in a sense a "captive" audience.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I cannot say that to authorize this prayer is to establish a religion in the strictly historic meaning of those words. [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]  A religion is not established in the usual sense merely by letting those who choose to do so say the prayer that the public school teacher leads.  Yet once government finances a religious exercise, it inserts a divisive influence into our communities. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]  The New York Court said that the prayer given does not conform to all of the tenets of the Jewish, Unitarian, and Ethical Culture groups.  One of the petitioners is an agnostic.</p>\n<p>"We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."  <em>Zorach v. Clauson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html">343 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#313">343 U. S. 313</a></span>.  Under our Bill of Rights, free play is given for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="443">Page 370 U. S. 443</a></p><p> making religion an active force in our lives. [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]  But "if a religious leaven is to be worked into the affairs of our people, it is to be done by individuals and groups, not by the Government."  <em>McGowan v. Maryland,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/case.html">366 U. S. 420</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/case.html#563">366 U. S. 563</a></span> (dissenting opinion).  By reason of the First Amendment, government is commanded "to have no interest in theology or ritual" (<em>id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/366/420/case.html#564">366 U. S. 564</a></span>), for on those matters "government must be neutral."  <em>Ibid.</em>  The First Amendment leaves the Government in a position not of hostility to religion, but of neutrality.  The philosophy is that the atheist or agnostic -- the nonbeliever -- is entitled to go his own way.  The philosophy is that, if government interferes in matters spiritual, it will be a divisive force.  The First Amendment teaches that a government neutral in the field of religion better serves all religious interests.</p>\n<p>My problem today would be uncomplicated but for <em>Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#17">330 U. S. 17</a></span>, which allowed taxpayers\' money to be used to pay "the bus fares of parochial school pupils as a part of a general program under which" the fares of pupils attending public and other schools were also paid.  The <em>Everson</em> case seems in retrospect to be out of line with the First Amendment.  Its result is appealing, as it allows aid to be given to needy children.  Yet, by the same token, public funds could be used to satisfy other needs of children in parochial schools -- lunches, books, and tuition being obvious examples.  Mr. Justice Rutledge stated in dissent what I think is durable First Amendment philosophy:</p>\n<p>"The reasons underlying the Amendment\'s policy have not vanished with time or diminished in force.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 370 U. S. 444</a></p><p> Now, as when it was adopted, the price of religious freedom is double.  It is that the church and religion shall live both within and upon that freedom.  There cannot be freedom of religion, safeguarded by the state, and intervention by the church or its agencies in the state\'s domain or dependency on its largesse.  Madison\'s Remonstrance, Par. 6, 8.  The great condition of religious liberty is that it be maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences, by the state.  For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation, it vanishes with the resting.  <em>Id.,</em> Par. 7, 8.  Public money devoted to payment of religious costs, educational or other, brings the quest for more.  It brings too the struggle of sect against sect for the larger share or for any.  Here one by numbers alone will benefit most, there another.  That is precisely the history of societies which have had an established religion and dissident groups.  <em>Id.</em> Par. 8, 11.  It is the very thing Jefferson and Madison experienced and sought to guard against, whether in its blunt or in its more screened forms.  <em>Ibid.</em>  The end of such strife cannot be other than to destroy the cherished liberty.  The dominating group will achieve the dominant benefit; or all will embroil the state in their dissensions.  <em>Id.,</em> Par. 11."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> pp. 53-54.</p>\n<p>What New York does with this prayer is a break with that tradition.  I therefore join the Court in reversing the judgment below.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>"There are many \'aids\' to religion in this country at all levels of government.  To mention but a few at the federal level, one might begin by observing that the very First Congress, which wrote the First Amendment, provided for chaplains in both Houses and in the armed services.  There is compulsory chapel at the service academies, and religious services are held in federal hospitals and prisons.  The President issues religious proclamations.  The Bible is used for the administration of oaths.  N.Y.A. and W.P.A. funds were available to parochial schools during the depression.  Veterans receiving money under the \'G.I.\' Bill of 1944 could attend denominational schools, to which payments were made directly by the government.  During World War II, federal money was contributed to denominational schools for the training of nurses.  The benefits of the National School Lunch Act are available to students in private as well as public schools.  The Hospital Survey and Construction Act of 1946 specifically made money available to nonpublic hospitals.  The slogan \'In God We Trust\' is used by the Treasury Department, and Congress recently added God to the pledge of allegiance.  There is Bible reading in the schools of the District of Columbia, and religious instruction is given in the District\'s National Training School for Boys.  Religious organizations are exempt from the federal income tax, and are granted postal privileges.  Up to defined limits -- 15 percent of the adjusted gross income of individuals and 5 percent of the net income of corporations -- contributions to religious organizations are deductible for federal income tax purposes.  There are no limits to the deductibility of gifts and bequests to religious institutions made under the federal gift and estate tax laws.  This list of federal \'aids\' could easily be expanded, and, of course, there is a long list in each state."</p>\n<p>Fellman, The Limits of Freedom (1959), pp. 40-41.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>West Point Cadets are required to attend chapel each Sunday.

For some of the petitioners in the present case profess no religion.</p>\n<p>The Pledge of Allegiance, like the prayer, recognizes the existence of a Supreme Being.  Since 1954, it has contained the words "one Nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."  36 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 17.  The House Report recommending the addition of the words "under God" stated that those words in no way run contrary to the First Amendment, but recognize "only the guidance of God in our national affairs."

He added:</p>\n<p>"I have felt that the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag which stands for the United States of America should recognize the Creator who we really believe is in control of the destinies of this great Republic."</p>\n<p>"It is true that, under the Constitution, no power is lodged anywhere to establish a religion . This is not an attempt to establish a religion; it has nothing to do with anything of that kind.  It relates to belief in God, in whom we sincerely repose our trust.  We know that America cannot be defended by guns, planes, and ships alone.  Appropriations and expenditures for defense will be of value only if the God under whom we live believes that we are in the right.  We should at all times recognize God\'s province over the lives of our people and over this great Nation."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> <em>And see</em> 100 Cong.Rec. 7757 <em>et seq.</em> for the debates in the House.</p>\n<p>The Act of March 3, 1865, 13 Stat. 517, 518, authorized the phrase "In God We Trust" to be placed on coins.  <em>And see</em> 17 Stat. 427.

In these and other ways, the Anglican Church was favored over the others.  The First Amendment put an end to placing any one church in a preferred position.  It ended support of any church or all churches by taxation.  It went further and prevented secular sanction to any religious ceremony, dogma, or rite.  Thus, it prevents civil penalties from being applied against recalcitrants or nonconformists.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/8" name="F2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]</p>\n<p>Some communities have a Christmas tree purchased with the taxpayers\' money.

I think this decision is wrong.</p>\n<p>The Court does not hold, nor could it, that New York has interfered with the free exercise of anybody\'s religion.  For the state courts have made clear that those who object to reciting the prayer must be entirely free of any compulsion to do so, including any "embarrassments and pressures."  <em>Cf. West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/319/624/case.html">319 U. S. 624</a></span>.  But the Court says that, in permitting school children to say this simple prayer, the New York authorities have established "an official religion."</p>\n<p>With all respect, I think the Court has misapplied a great constitutional principle.  I cannot see how an "official religion" is established by letting those who want to say a prayer say it.  On the contrary, I think that to deny the wish of these school children to join in reciting this prayer is to deny them the opportunity of sharing in the spiritual heritage of our Nation.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s historical review of the quarrels over the Book of Common Prayer in England throws no light for me on the issue before us in this case.  England had then and has now an established church.  Equally unenlightening, I think, is the history of the early establishment and later rejection of an official church in our own States.  For we deal here not with the establishment of a state church, which would, of course, be constitutionally impermissible, but with whether school children who want to begin their day by joining in prayer must be prohibited from doing so.  Moreover, I think that the Court\'s task, in this as in all areas of constitutional adjudication is not responsibly aided by the uncritical invocation of metaphors like the "wall of separation," a phrase nowhere to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 370 U. S. 446</a></p><p> be found in the Constitution.  What is relevant to the issue here is not the history of an established church in sixteenth century England or in eighteenth century America, but the history of the religious traditions of our people, reflected in countless practices of the institutions and officials of our government.</p>\n<p>At the opening of each day\'s Session of this Court we stand, while one of our officials invokes the protection of God.  Since the days of John Marshall, our Crier has said, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court." [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]  Both the Senate and the House of Representatives open their daily Sessions with prayer. [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>]  Each of our Presidents, from George Washington to John F. Kennedy, has, upon assuming his Office, asked the protection and help of God. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 370 U. S. 449</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court today says that the state and federal governments are without constitutional power to prescribe any particular form of words to be recited by any group of the American people on any subject touching religion. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  One of the stanzas of "The Star-Spangled Banner " made our National Anthem by Act of Congress in 1931, [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>] contains these verses:</p>\n<p>"Blest with victory and peace, may the heav\'n rescued land"</p>\n<p>"Praise the Pow\'r that hath made and preserved us a nation,"</p>\n<p>"Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just."</p>\n<p>"And this be our motto \'In God is our Trust.\'"</p>\n<p>In 1954, Congress added a phrase to the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag so that it now contains the words "one Nation <em>under</em> God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." [<a href="#F3/6" name="T3/6">Footnote 3/6</a>]  In 1952, Congress enacted legislation calling upon the President each year to proclaim a National Day of Prayer. [<a href="#F3/7" name="T3/7">Footnote 3/7</a>]  Since 1865, the words "IN GOD WE TRUST" have been impressed on our coins. [<a href="#F3/8" name="T3/8">Footnote 3/8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 370 U. S. 450</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Countless similar examples could be listed, but there is no need to belabor the obvious. [<a href="#F3/9" name="T3/9">Footnote 3/9</a>]  It was all summed up by this Court just ten years ago in a single sentence:  "We are a religious people whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."  <em>Zorach v.

And I do not believe the State of New York has done so in this case.  What each has done has been to recognize and to follow the deeply entrenched and highly cherished spiritual traditions of our Nation -- traditions which come down to us from those who almost two hundred years ago avowed their "firm Reliance on the Protection of divine Providence" when they proclaimed the freedom and independence of this brave new world.

In these my confidence will under every difficulty be best placed, next to that which we have all been encouraged to feel in the guardianship and guidance of that Almighty Being whose power regulates the destiny of nations, whose blessings have been so conspicuously dispensed to this rising Republic, and to whom we are bound to address our devout gratitude for the past, as well as our fervent supplications and best hopes for the future."</p>\n<p>On March 4, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln said:</p>\n<p>". . .
