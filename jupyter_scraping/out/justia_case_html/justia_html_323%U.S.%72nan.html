Only if it be decided that, by the local law such a union does not have capacity to be sued in its own name need there be consideration of the second part of Rule 17(b), which permits a suit against an unincorporated association for the enforcement of "a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States."</p>\n<p>The certificate in this case discloses that the Court of Appeals is in doubt as to the meaning and application of the rule laid down in <em>United Mine Workers v.

But, under Rules 17 and 81 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, as we have said, that question cannot arise in the present suit unless it is first decided that, under the law of the District, an unincorporated labor union is without capacity to be sued in its own name.  And we do not understand the certificate to seek our aid in the determination of this question of local law.</p>\n<p>In any event, we think it appropriate that the question of local law should be answered by the courts of the District before this Court is called upon to answer it, or to consider the application and effect of the second part of Rule 17(b) in an action in debt brought in the District of Columbia against an unincorporated labor union.  There are cogent reasons why this Court should not undertake to decide questions of local law without the aid of some expression of the views of judges of the local courts </p><p><a class="page-number" name="75">Page 323 U.

We have no occasion to discuss the meaning and application of the rule of the <em>Coronado</em> case or the second part of Rule 17(b), which are relevant only for the purpose of answering the question </p><p><a class="page-number" name="76">Page 323 U. S. 76</a></p><p> which, as we have said, we cannot properly answer.  The certificate is accordingly dismissed.</p>\n<p><em>So ordered.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE RUTLEDGE took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE FRANKFURTER, concurring.</p>\n<p>I join in the per curiam on the assumption that, after the Court of Appeals will have disposed of all issues to be decided by local District of Columbia law, nothing will be left in the certified question for this Court to answer.</p>\n<p>This is a suit for a lawyer\'s fee -- that is, an ordinary District of Columbia common law action of debt, and not one to enforce "a substantive right existing under the Constitution or laws of the United States."  For, I take it, in allowing an unincorporated association to be sued "in its common name for the purpose of enforcing . . . a substantive right existing under the . . . laws of the United States," Rule 17(b) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, referred to laws of general applicability throughout the United States, and not to the body of local law governing the District of Columbia.  Therefore, suability of an unincorporated labor union is a local procedural problem to be determined, according to Rule 17(b) in conjunction with Rule 81(e), by the local law of the District.  That "the suability of trades unions . . . is after all, in essence and principle, merely a procedural matter" is vouched for by the <em>Coronado</em> case, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/344/case.html">259 U. S. 344</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/259/344/case.html#390">259 U. S. 390</a></span>, the scope of which has been authoritatively defined in <em>Brown v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/134/case.html">276 U. S. 134</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/276/134/case.html#141">276 U. S. 141</a></span>, and <em>Moffat Tunnel League v.

Since substantive rights were outside the authority given by Congress for prescribing rules of civil procedure, Rule 17(b) and the note thereto by the Advisory Committee on Rules, by dealing with capacity to sue or be sued, decisively confirm the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="77">Page 323 U. S. 77</a></p><p> statement in the <em>Coronado</em> case that the suability of a trade union is a procedural matter.</p>\n<p>But, if such a procedural matter may be cast in the form of a substantive issue for the determination of status, it would, in this case in any event, be a question of the substantive law of the District, and not raise any substantive issue of federal law.  If a suit like this were brought in the District Court for the Southern District of New York under diversity jurisdiction, no conceivable question other than that of the procedural or substantive law of the New York could arise.  No federal question is infused into the litigation because such a local suit was brought in the District of Columbia.</p>\n<p>In view of the increase in the volume and the complexity of the business that is coming to this Court, and the bearing of this increase upon the proper discharge of its work (<em>see Ex parte Republic of Peru,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/318/578/case.html">318 U.
