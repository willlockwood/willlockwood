The policy was dated 21 July, 1810, and the vessel sailed on the voyage insured on the 5th of that month.  About 5 August following, she arrived at Port au Prince and was there stripped of her sails and a considerable part of her rigging by one James Gillespie, to whom she had been chartered for the voyage.  This was done with the knowledge and acquiescence of the master either for the purpose of procuring the loss of the vessel or of fitting up another vessel which Gillespie wished to dispatch to the United States.  On her return voyage, she was sunk by Gillespie, but whether with or without the knowledge of the master did not appear.

CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court, and after stating the facts, proceeded as follows:</p>\n<p>The general principle unquestionably is that to entitle the plaintiff to recover, the loss must be occasioned by one of the perils in the policy.  This is equally the rule of reason and the rule of law.  But the plaintiff contends that the case of <em>Vallejo v. Wheeler</em> denies the application of this principle to a loss in a case in which barratry has been committed.  This Court is not of that opinion.  The case of <em>Vallejo v. Wheeler</em> declares it to be immaterial whether the loss occurred during the continuance of the barratry, or afterwards, not whether the loss was produced by the barratry.  In that case the court was of opinion that the loss was produced by the barratry.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
