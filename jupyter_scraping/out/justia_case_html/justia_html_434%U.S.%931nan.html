Petitioners\' complaint further defined a subclass of "long-haired highway travelers," who allegedly have been subjected to illegal stops and searches solely because of their "highly individualized personal appearance."

There, the extent of the defendant officials\' knowledge of their subordinates\' unconstitutional actions was uncertain; plaintiffs apparently proceeded on the theory that the officials had a duty to act to correct a statistical pattern of abuse, regardless of their knowledge of the pattern. See 423 U.S., at 376. Here, petitioners\' evidence established that complaints about illegal searches were made to state police officials. The officials were, in the words of the Court of Appeals, "insensitiv[e]," "obliviou[s]," and "indifferen[t]" to these complaints. 554 F.2d, at 101. A failure to act in the face of knowledge of subordinates\' illegal actions is surely different from a failure to correct a statistical pattern of which one is not aware. Cf. Estelle v. Gamble, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/97/case.html">429 U.S. 97</a>, 104-106 (1976) ( distinguishing, for Eighth Amendment purposes, between "deliberate indifference" to prisoners\' medical needs and accidental failure to provide adequate care). </p><p> There is thus a closer nexus here between the inaction of responsible officials and the violations of rights by subordinates than there was in Rizzo. In addition, the plaintiff class is narrower here,2 named defendants have engaged in deliberate </p><p><a class="page-number" name="934">Page 434 U.S. 931 , 934</a></p><p> wrongdoing,3 and the injunctive relief sought is far less intrusive in terms of judicial interference with police operations.

Goode, see 423 U.S., at 366-367. Petitioners point out, moreover, that the plaintiff classes in Rizzo were coextensive with the city\'s electorate and thus had recourse to the political process to remedy official tolerance of abuse of civil rights, a factor that may have made the need for federal-court intervention appear less compelling. In the instant case, by contrast, many members of the class and subclass are interstate travelers who are merely driving through New Jersey and have no opportunity to correct official indifference through the State\'s political process. </p><p> </p><p><a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a> In Rizzo the policemen who were found to have violated constitutional rights were not named as defendants, a factor twice emphasized by the Court. See 423 U.S., at 371, 375. The only named defendants were supervisory officials. Id., at 364-365, n. 1. Here the defendants included the individual troopers who had committed illegal acts, as well as a class of unnamed troopers who had participated in the illegality. See 554 F.2d, at 95 n. 3. The presence of the supervisory defendants in this case may thus have been for the purpose of shaping an effective remedy. Cf. Hills v. Gautreaux, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/284/case.html#297">425 U.S. 284, 297</a> (1976) (once violation of rights is established, court of equity has broad power in fashioning remedy). </p><p><a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a> The injunction in Rizzo "significantly revis[ed] the internal procedures of the Philadelphia police department." 423 U.S., at 379, 96 S. Ct. 598. Petitioners here, by contrast, would be content with "[a] simple notification from superiors to subordinates that they [may] not constitutionally stop and search vehicles solely because of the personal appearance of the occupants."
