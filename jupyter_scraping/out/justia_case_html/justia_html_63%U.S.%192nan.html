JUSTICE CATRON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>Coleman sued Verden in a state court of Indiana on a note of hand, and a mortgage of lands to secure its payment.  On various pleadings and proofs, the cause was submitted for judgment to the court, the parties having dispensed with a jury.  Judgment was rendered against Verden, who appealed to the Supreme Court of Indiana.  There, the judgment of the circuit was affirmed.</p>\n<p>This occurred on the 26th day of June, 1858.  And then we find the following entry of record:</p>\n<p>"And afterwards, to-wit, at a court began and held on the 24th of May, 1858, and continued from day to day till July 16th, 1858, at which time come the appellant, by Hon D.
