Respondents are contract employees at NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which is operated by the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech).  Respondents were not subject to Government background checks at the time they were hired, but that changed when the President ordered the adoption of uniform identification standards for both federal civil servants and contractor employees.  The Department of Commerce mandated that contract employees with long-term access to federal facilities complete a standard background check, typically the National Agency Check with Inquiries (NACI), by October 2007.  NASA modified its contract with Cal Tech to reflect the new requirement, and JPL announced that employees who did not complete the NACI process in time would be denied access to JPL and face termination by Cal Tech.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The NACI process, long used for prospective civil servants, begins with the employee filling out a standard form (here, Standard Form 85, the Questionnaire for Non-Sensitive Positions (SF\xe2\x80\x9385)).  SF\xe2\x80\x9385 asks whether an employee has \xe2\x80\x9cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\xe2\x80\x9d in the last year.  If so, the employee must provide details, including information about \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling received.\xe2\x80\x9d  The employee must also sign a release authorizing the Government to obtain personal information from schools, employers, and others during its investigation.  Once SF\xe2\x80\x9385 is completed, the Government sends the employee\xe2\x80\x99s references a questionnaire (Form 42) that asks open-ended questions about whether they have \xe2\x80\x9cany reason to question\xe2\x80\x9d the employee\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chonesty or trustworthiness,\xe2\x80\x9d or have \xe2\x80\x9cadverse information\xe2\x80\x9d concerning a variety of other matters.  All SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 responses are subject to the protections of the Privacy Act.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With the deadline for completing the NACI process drawing near, respondents brought suit, claiming, as relevant here, that the background-check process violates a constitutional right to informational privacy.  The District Court declined to issue a preliminary injunction, but the Ninth Circuit reversed.  It held that SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x99s inquiries into recent drug involvement furthered the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in combating illegal-drug use, but that the drug \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held unconstitutional.  It also held that Form 42\xe2\x80\x99s open-ended questions were not narrowly tailored to meet the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in verifying contractors\xe2\x80\x99 identities and ensuring JPL\xe2\x80\x99s security, and thus also likely violated respondents\xe2\x80\x99 informational-privacy rights.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>: </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0In two cases decided over 30 years ago, this Court referred broadly to a constitutional privacy \xe2\x80\x9cinterest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whalen</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/index.html">429 U. S. 589</a>, 599\xe2\x80\x93600; <em>Nixo</em>n v. <em>Administrator of General Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/index.html">433 U. S. 425</a>, 457.  In <em>Whalen, </em>the Court<em> </em>upheld a New York law permitting the collection of names and addresses of persons prescribed dangerous drugs, finding that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecurity provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d which protected against \xe2\x80\x9cpublic disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d of patient information, 462 U. S., at 600\xe2\x80\x93601, were sufficient to protect a privacy interest \xe2\x80\x9carguably . . . root[ed] in the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 605.  In <em>Nixon, </em>the Court upheld a law requiring the former President to turn over his presidential papers and tape recordings for archival review and screening, concluding that the federal Act at issue, like the statute in <em>Whalen</em>, had protections against \xe2\x80\x9cundue dissemination of private materials.\xe2\x80\x9d  433 U. S. at 458.  Since <em>Nixon, </em>the Court has said little else on the subject of a constitutional right to informational privacy.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0Assuming, without deciding, that the Government\xe2\x80\x99s challenged inquiries implicate a privacy interest of constitutional significance, that interest, whatever its scope, does not prevent the Government from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject to the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s safeguards against public disclosure.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9324.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The forms are reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake.

When the Government acts in its capacity \xe2\x80\x9cas proprietor\xe2\x80\x9d and manager of its \xe2\x80\x9cinternal operation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers</em> v. <em>McElroy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/886/index.html">367 U. S. 886</a>, 896, it has a much freer hand than when it regulates as to citizens generally.  The questions respondents challenge are part of a standard background check of the sort used by millions of private employers.  The Government has been conducting employment investigations since the Republic\xe2\x80\x99s earliest days, and the President has had statutory authority to assess an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s fitness for the civil service since 1871.  Standard background investigations similar to those at issue became mandatory for federal civil-service candidates in 1953, and the investigations challenged here arose from a decision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees.  This history shows that the Government has an interest in conducting basic background checks in order to ensure the security of its facilities and to employ a competent, reliable workforce to carry out the people\xe2\x80\x99s business.  The interest is not diminished by the fact that respondents are contract employees.  There are no meaningful distinctions in the duties of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s civil-service and contractor employees, especially at JPL, where contract employees do work that is critical to NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission and that is funded with a multibillion dollar taxpayer investment.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The challenged questions on SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 are reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in managing its internal operations.  SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question is a followup question to a reasonable inquiry about illegal-drug use.  In context, the drug-treatment inquiry is also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry. The Government, recognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and medical issue, seeks to separate out those drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.  Thus, it uses responses to the drug-treatment question as a mitigating factor in its contractor credentialing decisions.  The Court rejects the argument that the Government has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its employment background questions are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests.  So exacting a standard runs directly contrary to <em>Whalen</em>.  See 429 U. S., at 596\xe2\x80\x93597.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0Like SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x99s drug-treatment question, Form 42\xe2\x80\x99s open-ended questions are reasonably aimed at identifying capable employees who will faithfully conduct the Government\xe2\x80\x99s business.  Asking an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s designated references broad questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones.  The reasonableness of such questions is illustrated by their pervasiveness in the public and private sectors.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In addition to being reasonable in light of the Government interests at stake, SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 are also subject to substantial protections against disclosure to the public.  <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em> recognized that a \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\xe2\x80\x9d generally allays privacy concerns created by government \xe2\x80\x9caccumulation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal information\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 605.  Respondents attack only the Government\xe2\x80\x99s collection of information, and here, as in <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em>, the information collected is shielded by statute from unwarranted disclosure.  The Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x94which allows the Government to maintain only those records \xe2\x80\x9crelevant and necessary to accomplish\xe2\x80\x9d a purpose authorized by law, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a(e)(1); requires written consent before the Government may disclose an individual\xe2\x80\x99s records, \xc2\xa7552a(b); and imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure obligations, \xc2\xa7552a(i)(1)\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cevidence[s] a proper concern\xe2\x80\x9d for individual privacy.  <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 605; <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim that the statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure bar, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(12), leave its protections too porous to supply a meaningful check against unwarranted disclosures.  But that argument rests on an incorrect reading of <em>Whalen,</em> <em>Nixon,</em> and the Privacy Act.

Respondents in this case, federal contract employees at a Government laboratory, claim that two parts of a standard employment background investigation violate their rights under <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon</em>.  Respondents challenge a section of a form questionnaire that asks employees about treatment or counseling for recent illegal-drug use.  They also object to certain open-ended questions on a form sent to employees\xe2\x80\x99 designated references.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We assume, without deciding, that the Constitution protects a privacy right of the sort mentioned in <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon</em>.  We hold, however, that the challenged portions of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s background check do not violate this right in the present case.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests as employer and proprietor in managing its internal operations, combined with the protections against public dissemination provided by the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.

While many of these workers are federal civil servants, a substantial majority are employed directly by Government contractors.  Contract employees play an important role in NASA\xe2\x80\x99s mission, and their duties are functionally equivalent to those performed by civil servants.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One NASA facility, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in Pasadena, California, is staffed exclusively by contract employees.  NASA owns JPL, but the California Institute of Technology (Cal Tech) operates the facility under a Government contract.  JPL is the lead NASA center for deep-space robotics and communications.  Most of this country\xe2\x80\x99s unmanned space missions\xe2\x80\x94from the Explorer 1 satellite in 1958 to the Mars Rovers of today\xe2\x80\x94have been developed and run by JPL.

In some instances, individual contracts required background checks for the employees of federal contractors, but no blanket policy was in place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government has recently taken steps to eliminate this two-track approach to background investigations.

The court went on to hold, however, that the portion of the form requiring disclosure of drug \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d furthered no legitimate interest and was thus likely to be held unconstitutional.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Form 42, in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 estimation, was even \xe2\x80\x9cmore problematic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The form\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended and highly private\xe2\x80\x9d questions, the court concluded, were not \xe2\x80\x9cnarrowly tailored\xe2\x80\x9d to meet the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in verifying contractors\xe2\x80\x99 identities and \xe2\x80\x9censuring the security of the JPL.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 881, 880.

This sort of \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9caccumulated private data\xe2\x80\x9d was sufficient, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, to protect a privacy interest that \xe2\x80\x9carguably ha[d] its roots in the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 605\xe2\x80\x93606.

In a section of the opinion entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPrivacy,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court addressed a combination of claims that the review required by this Act violated the former President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cFourth and Fifth Amendmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d rights.  <em>Id.</em>, at 455, and n.\xc2\xa018, 458\xe2\x80\x93459.

S., at 599, 605.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  We hold, however, that, whatever the scope of this interest, it does not prevent the Government from asking reasonable questions of the sort included on SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 in an employment background investigation that is subject to the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s safeguards against public disclosure.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, judicial review of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s challenged inquiries must take into account the context in which they arise.  When the Government asks respondents and their references to fill out SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42, it does not exercise its sovereign power \xe2\x80\x9cto regulate or license.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers</em> v. <em>McElroy</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/886/index.html">367 U. S. 886</a>, 896 (1961).  Rather, the Government conducts the challenged background checks in its capacity \xe2\x80\x9cas proprietor\xe2\x80\x9d and manager of its \xe2\x80\x9cinternal operation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Time and again our cases have recognized that the Government has a much freer hand in dealing \xe2\x80\x9cwith citizen employees than it does when it brings its sovereign power to bear on citizens at large.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Engquist </em>v.<em> Oregon Dept. of Agriculture</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/553/591/index.html">553 U.

This distinction is grounded on the \xe2\x80\x9ccommon-sense realization\xe2\x80\x9d that if every \xe2\x80\x9cemployment decision became a constitutional matter,\xe2\x80\x9d the Government could not function.  See <em>Connick </em>v.<em> Myers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/index.html">461 U.

The questions challenged by respondents are part of a standard employment background check of the sort used by millions of private employers.  See Brief for Consumer Data Indus. Assn. et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 2 (hereinafter CDIA Brief) (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ore than 88% of U. S.\ncompanies \xe2\x80\xa6 perform background checks on their employees\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Government itself has been conducting employment investigations since the earliest days of the Republic.  L. White, The Federalists: A Study in Administrative History 262\xe2\x80\x93263 (1948); see OPM, Biography of An Ideal: History of the Federal Civil Service 8 (2002) (noting that President Washington \xe2\x80\x9cset a high standard\xe2\x80\x9d for federal office and finalized appointments only after \xe2\x80\x9cinvestigating [candidates\xe2\x80\x99] capabilities and reputations\xe2\x80\x9d).  Since 1871, the President has enjoyed statutory authority to \xe2\x80\x9cascertain the fitness of applicants\xe2\x80\x9d for the civil service \xe2\x80\x9cas to age, health, character, knowledge and ability for the employment sought,\xe2\x80\x9d Act of Mar. 3, 1871, Rev.

Exec. Order No.\xc2\xa010450, 3 CFR 936.  And the particular investigations challenged in this case arose from a decision to extend that requirement to federal contract employees requiring long-term access to federal facilities.  See HSPD\xe2\x80\x9312, at 1765, App. 127; FIPS PUB 201\xe2\x80\x931, at iii\xe2\x80\x93vi, 1\xe2\x80\x938, App. 131\xe2\x80\x93150.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this long history suggests, the Government has an interest in conducting basic employment background checks.  Reasonable investigations of applicants and employees aid the Government in ensuring the security of its facilities and in employing a competent, reliable workforce.  See <em>Engquist</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 598\xe2\x80\x93599.  Courts must keep those interests in mind when asked to go line-by-line through the Government\xe2\x80\x99s employment forms and to scrutinize the choice and wording of the questions they contain.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that, because they are contract employees and not civil servants, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s broad authority in managing its affairs should apply with diminished force.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest as \xe2\x80\x9cproprietor\xe2\x80\x9d in managing its operations, <em>Cafeteria &amp; Restaurant Workers</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 896, does not turn on such formalities.  See <em>Board of Comm\xe2\x80\x99rs, Wabaunsee Cty. </em>v.<em> Umbehr</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/518/668/index.html">518 U.

The fact that respondents\xe2\x80\x99 direct employment relationship is with Cal Tech\xe2\x80\x94which operates JPL under a Government contract\xe2\x80\x94says very little about the interests at stake in this case.  The record shows that, as a \xe2\x80\x9cpractical matter,\xe2\x80\x9d there are no \xe2\x80\x9c[r]elevant distinctions\xe2\x80\x9d between the duties performed by NASA\xe2\x80\x99s civil-service workforce and its contractor workforce.

See NASA, Jet Propulsion Laboratory Annual Report 09, p.\xc2\xa035 (2010), online at http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/annualreport/2009-report.pdf.  The\nGovernment has a strong interest in conducting basic background checks into the contract employees minding the store at JPL.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these interests in view, we conclude that the challenged portions of both SF\xe2\x80\x9385 and Form 42 consist of reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in managing its internal operations.  See <em>Engquist</em>, 553 U. S., at 598\xe2\x80\x93599; <em>Whalen, </em>429 U. S., at 597\xe2\x80\x93598.  As to SF\xe2\x80\x9385, the only part of the form challenged here is its request for information about \xe2\x80\x9cany treatment or counseling received\xe2\x80\x9d for illegal-drug use within the previous year.  The \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question, however, must be considered in context.  It is a followup to SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x99s inquiry into whether the employee has \xe2\x80\x9cused, possessed, supplied, or manufactured illegal drugs\xe2\x80\x9d during the past year.  The Government has good reason to ask employees about their recent illegal-drug use.  Like any employer, the Government is entitled to have its projects staffed by reliable, law-abiding persons who will \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98efficiently and effectively\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d discharge their duties.  See <em>Engquist</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 598\xe2\x80\x93599.  Questions about illegal-drug use are a useful way of figuring out which persons have these characteristics.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Breen &amp; Matusitz, An Updated Examination of the Effects of Illegal Drug Use in the Workplace, 19 J. Human Behavior in the Social Environment, 434 (2009) (illicit drug use negatively correlated with workplace productivity).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In context, the follow-up question on \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d for recent illegal-drug use is also a reasonable, employment-related inquiry.  The Government, recognizing that illegal-drug use is both a criminal and a medical issue, seeks to separate out those illegal-drug users who are taking steps to address and overcome their problems.  The Government thus uses responses to the \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question as a mitigating factor in determining whether to grant contract employees long-term access to federal facilities.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is a reasonable, and indeed a humane, approach, and respondents do not dispute the legitimacy of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s decision to use drug treatment as a mitigating factor in its contractor credentialing decisions.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument is that, if drug treatment is only used to mitigate, then the Government should change the mandatory phrasing of SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cInclude [in your answer] any treatment or counseling received\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so as to make a response optional.  App. 94.  As it stands, the mandatory \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question is unconstitutional, in respondents\xe2\x80\x99 view, because it is \xe2\x80\x9cmore intrusive than necessary to satisfy the government\xe2\x80\x99s objective.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 26; 530 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 879 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question should be enjoined because the form \xe2\x80\x9cappears to <em>compel</em> disclosure\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We reject the argument that the Government, when it requests job-related personal information in an employment background check, has a constitutional burden to demonstrate that its questions are \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary\xe2\x80\x9d or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests.  So exacting a standard runs directly contrary to <em>Whalen</em>.  The patients in <em>Whalen</em>, much like respondents here, argued that New York\xe2\x80\x99s statute was unconstitutional because the State could not \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrate the necessity\xe2\x80\x9d of its program.  429 U. S., at 596.  The Court quickly rejected that argument, concluding that New York\xe2\x80\x99s collection of patients\xe2\x80\x99 prescription information could \xe2\x80\x9cnot be held unconstitutional simply because\xe2\x80\x9d a court viewed it as \xe2\x80\x9cunnecessary, in whole or in part.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 596\xe2\x80\x93597.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That analysis applies with even greater force where the Government acts, not as a regulator, but as the manager of its internal affairs.  See <em>Engquist</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 598\xe2\x80\x93599.  SF\xe2\x80\x9385\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ctreatment or counseling\xe2\x80\x9d question reasonably seeks to identify a subset of acknowledged drug users who are attempting to overcome their problems.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s considered position is that phrasing the question in more permissive terms would result in a lower response rate, and the question\xe2\x80\x99s effectiveness in identifying illegal-drug users who are suitable for employment would be \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially reduced.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioners 19.

Asking an applicant\xe2\x80\x99s designated references broad, open-ended questions about job suitability is an appropriate tool for separating strong candidates from weak ones.  It would be a truly daunting task to catalog all the reasons why a person might not be suitable for a particular job, and references do not have all day to answer a laundry list of specific questions.  See CDIA Brief 6\xe2\x80\x937 (references \xe2\x80\x9ctypically have limited time to answer questions from potential employers,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9copen-ended questions\xe2\x80\x9d yield more relevant information than narrow inquiries).

Both <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em> recognized that government \xe2\x80\x9caccumulation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal information\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9cpublic purposes\xe2\x80\x9d may pose a threat to privacy.  <em>Whalen</em>, 429 U.

The Court in <em>Whalen</em>, relying on New York\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecurity provisions\xe2\x80\x9d prohibiting public disclosure, turned aside a challenge to the collection of patients\xe2\x80\x99 prescription information.  429 U.

And here, no less than in <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em>, the information collected is shielded by statute from \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted disclosur[e].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 605.  The Privacy Act, which covers all information collected during the background-check process, allows the Government to maintain records \xe2\x80\x9cabout an individual\xe2\x80\x9d only to the extent the records are \xe2\x80\x9crelevant and necessary to accomplish\xe2\x80\x9d a purpose authorized by law.  5 U.

And the Act imposes criminal liability for willful violations of its nondisclosure obligations.  \xc2\xa7552a(i)(1).  These requirements, as we have noted, give \xe2\x80\x9cforceful recognition\xe2\x80\x9d to a Government employee\xe2\x80\x99s interest in maintaining the \xe2\x80\x9cconfidentiality of sensitive information . . . in his personnel files.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Detroit Edison Co.</em> v. <em>NLRB</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/301/index.html">440 U.

Like the protections against disclosure in <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em>, they \xe2\x80\x9cevidence a proper concern\xe2\x80\x9d for individual privacy.  <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 605; <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 458\xe2\x80\x93459.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notwithstanding these safeguards, respondents argue that statutory exceptions to the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s disclosure bar, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(b)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(12), leave its protections too porous to supply a meaningful check against \xe2\x80\x9cunwarranted disclosures,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 605.  Respondents point in particular to what they describe as a \xe2\x80\x9cbroad\xe2\x80\x9d exception\nfor \xe2\x80\x9croutine use[s],\xe2\x80\x9d defined as uses that are \xe2\x80\x9ccompatible with the purpose for which the record was collected.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7552a(b)(3), (a)(7).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on these exceptions rests on an incorrect reading of both our precedents and the terms of the Privacy Act.  As to our cases, the Court in <em>Whalen</em> and <em>Nixon</em> referred approvingly to statutory or regulatory protections against \xe2\x80\x9c<em>unwarranted </em>disclosures\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c<em>undue </em>dissemination\xe2\x80\x9d of personal information collected by the Government.  <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 605;<em> Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 458.  Neither case suggested that an ironclad disclosure bar is needed to satisfy privacy interests that may be \xe2\x80\x9croot[ed] in the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 605.  In <em>Whalen</em>, the New York statute prohibiting \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ublic disclosure of the identity of patients\xe2\x80\x9d was itself subject to several exceptions.  429 U. S., at 594\xe2\x80\x93595, and n.\xc2\xa012.  In <em>Nixon</em>, the protections against \xe2\x80\x9cundue dissemination\xe2\x80\x9d mentioned in the opinion were not even before the Court, but were to be included in forthcoming regulations \xe2\x80\x9cmandate[d]\xe2\x80\x9d by the challenged Act.  433 U. S., at 458; see <em>id.</em>, at 437\xe2\x80\x93439 (explaining that the Court was limiting its review to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfacial validity\xe2\x80\x9d and was not considering the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s forthcoming regulations).  Thus, the mere fact that the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s nondisclosure requirement is subject to exceptions does not show that the statute provides insufficient protection against public disclosure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does the substance of the \xe2\x80\x9croutine use\xe2\x80\x9d exception relied on by respondents create any undue risk of public dissemination.  None of the authorized \xe2\x80\x9croutine use[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 background-check information allows for release to the public.  71 Fed. Reg. 45859\xe2\x80\x9345860, 45862 (2006); 60 Fed. Reg. 63084 (1995), as amended, 75 Fed. Reg. 28307 (2010).  Rather, the established \xe2\x80\x9croutine use[s]\xe2\x80\x9d consist of limited, reasonable steps designed to complete the background-check process in an efficient and orderly manner.  See <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 602 (approving disclosures to authorized New York Department of Health employees that were not \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfully distinguishable\xe2\x80\x9d from routine disclosures \xe2\x80\x9cassociated with many facets of health care\xe2\x80\x9d).  One routine use, for example, involves a limited disclosure to persons filling out Form 42 so that designated references can \xe2\x80\x9cidentify the individual\xe2\x80\x9d at issue and can understand the \xe2\x80\x9cnature and purpose of the investigation.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 89.

The \xe2\x80\x9cremote possibility\xe2\x80\x9d of public disclosure created by these narrow \xe2\x80\x9croutine use[s]\xe2\x80\x9d does not undermine the Privacy Act\xe2\x80\x99s substantial protections.

In this case, petitioners did not ask us to hold that there is no constitutional right to informational privacy, and respondents and their <em>amici</em> thus understandably refrained from addressing that issue in detail.  It is undesirable for us to decide a matter of this importance in a case in which we do not have the benefit of briefing by the parties and in which potential <em>amici</em> had little notice that the matter might be decided.

But rather than reach this conclusion on the basis of the never-explained assumption that the Constitution requires courts to \xe2\x80\x9cbalance\xe2\x80\x9d the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interests in data collection against its contractor employees\xe2\x80\x99 interest in privacy, I reach it on simpler grounds.  Like many other desirable things not included \nin the Constitution, \xe2\x80\x9cinformational privacy\xe2\x80\x9d seems like a good idea\xe2\x80\x94wherefore the People have enacted laws at the federal level and in the states restricting the government\xe2\x80\x99s collection and use of information.  But it is up to the People to enact those laws, to shape them, and, when they think it appropriate, to repeal them.  A federal constitutional right to \xe2\x80\x9cinformational privacy\xe2\x80\x9d does not exist.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before addressing the constitutional issues, however, I must observe a remarkable and telling fact about this case, unique in my tenure on this Court: Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 brief, in arguing that the Federal Government violated the Constitution, does not once identify which provision of \nthe Constitution that might be.  The Table of Authorities contains citations of cases from federal and state courts, federal and state statutes, Rules of Evidence from four states, two Executive Orders, a House Report, and even more exotic sources of law, such as two reports of the Government Accountability Office and an EEOC document concerning \xe2\x80\x9cEnforcement Guidance.\xe2\x80\x9d  And yet it contains not a single citation of the sole document we are called upon to construe: the Constitution of the United States.  The body of the brief includes a single, fleeting reference to the Due Process Clause, buried in a citation of the assuredly inapposite <em>Lawrence</em> v. <em>Texas</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/539/558/index.html">539 U. S. 558</a> (2003), Brief for Respondents 42; but no further attempt is made to argue that NASA\xe2\x80\x99s actions deprived respondents of liberty without due process of law.  And this legal strategy was not limited to respondents\xe2\x80\x99 filing in this Court; in the Ninth Circuit respondents asserted in a footnote that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts have grounded the right to informational privacy in various provisions of the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Appellants in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9356424, p.\xc2\xa025, n.\xc2\xa018, but declined to identify which ones applied here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To tell the truth, I found this approach refreshingly honest.  One who asks us to invent a constitutional right out of whole cloth should spare himself and us the pretense of tying it to some words of the Constitution.  Regrettably, this Lincolnesque honesty evaporated at oral argument, when counsel asserted, apparently for the first time in this litigation, that the right to informational privacy emerged from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  That counsel invoked the infinitely plastic concept of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d due process does not make this constitutional theory any less invented.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is easily resolved on the simple ground that the Due Process Clause does not \xe2\x80\x9cguarante[e] certain (unspecified) liberties\xe2\x80\x9d; rather, it \xe2\x80\x9cmerely guarantees certain procedures as a prerequisite to deprivation of liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Albright</em> v. <em>Oliver</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/266/index.html">510 U. S. 266</a>, 275 (1994) (Scalia, J., concurring).  Respondents make no claim that the State has deprived them of liberty without the requisite procedures, and their due process claim therefore must fail.  Even under the formula we have adopted for identifying liberties entitled to protection under the faux \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d component of the Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x94that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Due Process Clause specially protects those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history and tradition,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Washington</em> v. <em>Glucksberg</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/702/index.html">521 U. S. 702</a>, 720\xe2\x80\x93721 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)\xe2\x80\x94respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claim would fail.  Respondents do not even attempt to argue that the claim at issue in this case passes that test, perhaps recognizing the farcical nature of a contention that a right deeply rooted in our history and tradition bars the Government from ensuring that the Hubble Telescope is not used by recovering drug addicts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absurdity of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position in this case should not, however, obscure the broader point: Our due process precedents, even our \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive due process\xe2\x80\x9d precedents, do not support <em>any</em> right to informational privacy.  First, we have held that the government\xe2\x80\x99s act of defamation does not deprive a person \xe2\x80\x9cof any \xe2\x80\x98liberty\xe2\x80\x99 protected by the procedural guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Paul</em> v. <em>Davis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/693/index.html">424 U. S. 693</a>, 709 (1976).  We reasoned that stigma, standing alone, does not \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly alte[r]\xe2\x80\x9d a person\xe2\x80\x99s legal status so as to \xe2\x80\x9cjustif[y] the invocation of procedural safeguards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 708\xe2\x80\x93709.  If outright defamation does not qualify, it is unimaginable that the mere disclosure of private information does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, respondents challenge the Government\xe2\x80\x99s <em>collection</em> of their private information.  But the Government\xe2\x80\x99s collection of private information is regulated by the Fourth Amendment, and \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here a particular Amendment provides an explicit textual source of constitutional protection against a particular sort of government behavior, that Amendment, not the more generalized notion of substantive due process, must be the guide for analyzing these claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>County of Sacramento</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, 842 (1998) (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original).  Here, the Ninth Circuit rejected respondents\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment argument, correctly holding that the Form 42 inquiries to third parties were not Fourth Amendment \xe2\x80\x9csearches\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>United States</em> v. <em>Miller</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/index.html">425 U. S. 435</a> (1976), and that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the Government from asking questions about private information.  530 F.\xc2\xa03d 865, 876\xe2\x80\x93877 (2008).  That should have been the end of the matter.  Courts should not use the Due Process Clause as putty to fill up gaps they deem unsightly in the protections provided by other constitutional provisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, I would simply hold that there is no constitutional right to \xe2\x80\x9cinformational privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Besides being consistent with constitutional text and tradition, this view has the attractive benefit of resolving this case without resort to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exegesis on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in identifying contractor drug abusers and the comfortingly narrow scope of NASA\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9croutine use\xe2\x80\x9d regulations.  I shall not fill the U. S. Reports with further explanation of the incoherence of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive due process\xe2\x80\x9d doctrine in its many manifestations, since the Court does not play the substantive-due-process card.  Instead, it states that it will \xe2\x80\x9cassume, without deciding\xe2\x80\x9d that there exists a right to informational privacy, <em>ante</em>, \nat 1.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s sole justification for its decision to \xe2\x80\x9cassume, without deciding\xe2\x80\x9d is that the Court made the same mistake before\xe2\x80\x94in two 33-year-old cases, <em>Whalen</em> v. <em>Roe</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/index.html">429 U. S. 589</a> (1977), and <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Administrator of General Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/index.html">433 U. S. 425</a> (1977).*<footcall num="*"> <em>Ante</em>, at 11.  But <em>stare decisis</em> is simply irrelevant when the pertinent precedent assumed, without deciding, the existence of a constitutional right.  \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Stare decisis </em>reflects a policy judgment that in most matters it is more important that the applicable rule of law be settled than that it be settled right.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>State Oil Co.</em> v. <em>Khan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/522/3/index.html">522 U. S. 3</a>, 20 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is the preferred course because it promotes the evenhanded, predictable, and consistent development of legal principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  Here, however, there <em>is</em> no applicable rule of law that is settled.  To the contrary, <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon</em> created an uncertainty that the text of the Constitution did not contain and that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion perpetuates.</footcall></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A further reason <em>Whalen </em>and <em>Nixon</em> are not entitled to <em>stare decisis</em> effect is that neither opinion supplied any coherent reason why a constitutional right to informational privacy might exist.  As supporting authority, <em>Whalen</em> cited <em>Stanley</em> v. <em>Georgia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/557/index.html">394 U. S. 557</a> (1969), a First Amendment case protecting private possession of obscenity; the deservedly infamous dictum in <em>Griswold</em> v. <em>Connecticut</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/479/index.html">381 U. S. 479</a> (1965), concerning the \xe2\x80\x9cpenumbra\xe2\x80\x9d of the First Amendment; and three concurring or dissenting opinions, none of which remotely intimated that there might be such a thing as a substantive due process right to informational privacy.  429 U. S., at 599, n.\xc2\xa025.  <em>Nixon</em> provided even less support.  After citing the observation in <em>Whalen</em> that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne element of privacy has been characterized as the individual interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 457 (quoting <em>Whalen</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 599; internal quotation marks omitted), it proceeded to conduct a straightforward <em>Fourth Amendment</em> analysis.  It \xe2\x80\x9cassume[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that there was a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate expectation of privacy\xe2\x80\x9d in the materials, and rejected the appellant\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the statute at issue was \xe2\x80\x9cprecisely the kind of abuse that the Fourth Amendment was intended to prevent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Nixon</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 457\xe2\x80\x93458, 460.  It is unfathomable why these cases\xe2\x80\x99 passing, barely explained reference to a right separate from the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x94an unenumerated right that they held to be <em>not</em> applicable\xe2\x80\x94should be afforded <em>stare decisis</em> weight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point the reader may be wondering: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat, after all, is the harm in being \xe2\x80\x98minimalist\xe2\x80\x99 and simply refusing to say that violation of a constitutional right of informational privacy can never exist?  The outcome in this case is the same, so long as the Court holds that any such hypothetical right was not violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  Well, there is harm.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s never-say-never disposition does damage for several reasons.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01. It is in an important sense not actually minimalist.  By substituting for one real constitutional question (whether there exists a constitutional right to informational privacy) a different constitutional question (whether NASA\xe2\x80\x99s background checks would contravene a right to informational privacy if such a right existed), the Court gets to pontificate upon a matter that is none of its \nbusiness: the appropriate balance between security and privacy.  If I am correct that there exists no right to in-formational privacy, all that discussion is an exercise in judicial <em>maximalism</em>.  Better simply to state and apply \nthe law forthrightly than to hold our view of the law <em>in pectore</em>, so that we can inquire into matters beyond our charter, and probably beyond our ken.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, on the other hand, the Court believes that there <em>is</em> a constitutional right to informational privacy, then I fail to see the minimalist virtues in delivering a lengthy opinion analyzing that right while coyly noting that the right is \xe2\x80\x9cassumed\xe2\x80\x9d rather than \xe2\x80\x9cdecided.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thirty-three years have passed since the Court first suggested that the right may, or may not, exist.  It is past time for the Court to abandon this Alfred Hitchcock line of our jurisprudence.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02. It harms our image, if not our self-respect, because it makes no sense.  The Court decides that the Government did not violate the right to informational privacy without deciding whether there <em>is</em> a right to informational privacy, and without even describing what hypothetical standard should be used to assess whether the hypothetical right has been violated.  As I explained last Term in objecting to another of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s never-say-never dispositions:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[The Court] cannot decide that [respondents\xe2\x80\x99] claim fails without first deciding what a valid claim would consist of\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [A]greeing to or crafting a <em>hypothetical</em> standard for a <em>hypothetical</em> constitutional right is sufficiently unappealing \xe2\x80\xa6 that [the Court] might as well acknowledge the right as well.  Or [it] could avoid the need to agree with or craft a hypothetical standard by <em>denying </em>the right.  But embracing a standard while being coy about the right is, well, odd; and deciding this case while addressing <em>neither </em>the standard <em>nor </em>the right is quite impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stop the Beach Renourishment, Inc.</em> v. <em>Florida Dept. of Environmental Protection</em>, 560 U.

So in <em>Cruzan</em> v. <em>Director, Mo.</em> <em>Dept. of Health,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/261/index.html">497 U. S. 261</a>, 279\xe2\x80\x93280 (1990), we declined to decide whether a competent person had a constitutional right to refuse lifesaving hydration, because\xe2\x80\x94under a constitutional standard we laid out in detail\xe2\x80\x94such a right did not exist for an incompetent person.  In <em>Herrera</em> v. <em>Collins, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/506/390/index.html">506 U. S. 390</a>, 417\xe2\x80\x93418 (1993), we declined to decide whether it would be unconstitutional to execute an innocent person, because Herrera had not shown that he was innocent.  In <em>New York State Club Assn.</em>,<em> Inc.</em> v. <em>City of New York,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/1/index.html">487 U. S. 1</a>, 10\xe2\x80\x9315 (1988), we declined to decide whether there was a constitutional right of private association for certain clubs, because the plaintiff had brought a facial challenge, which would fail if the statute was valid in many of its applications, making it unnecessary to decide whether an as-applied challenge as to some clubs could succeed.  Here, however, the Court actually <em>applies</em> a constitutional informational privacy standard without giving a clue as to the rule of law it is applying.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.

Of course, given that we are told neither what the appropriate standard should be when the Government is acting as regulator nor what the appropriate standard should be when it is acting as proprietor, it is not clear <em>what</em> effect this fact has on the analysis; but at least we know that it is <em>something</em>.</f></f></left></p>\n<p>\n<left><f f="Symbol">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<f f="Century Schoolbook">History and tradition have some role to play, <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, but how much is uncertain.

It will dramatically increase the number of lawsuits claiming violations of the right to informational privacy.

Moreover, the utter silliness of respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position in this case leaves plenty of room for the possible success of future claims that are meritless, but slightly less absurd.  Respondents claim that <em>even though</em> they are Government contractor employees, and <em>even though</em> they are working with highly expensive scientific equipment, and <em>even though</em> the Government is seeking only information about drug treatment and information from third parties that is standard in background checks, and <em>even though</em> the Government is liable for damages if that information is ever revealed, and <em>even though</em> NASA\xe2\x80\x99s Privacy Act regulations are very protective of private information, NASA\xe2\x80\x99s background checks are unconstitutional.

And it should not be thought that the concession by the United States is an entirely self-denying act.  To be sure, it subjects the Executive Branch to constitutional limitations on the collection and use of information; but the Privacy Act, 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7552a (2006 ed. and Supp. III), already contains extensive limitations not likely to be surpassed by constitutional improvisation.  And because Congress\xe2\x80\x99s power under \xc2\xa75 of the Fourteenth Amendment extends to the full scope of the Due Process Clause, see <em>City</em> <em>of Boerne</em> v. <em>Flores</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/507/index.html">521 U.
