The suits were brought by Clayton Brown, Jeffrey Taylor, and Sharon Marchio.  In each case, a family member of a patient requiring extensive nursing care had signed an agreement with a nursing home on behalf of the patient.  The relevant parts of the agreements in Brown\xe2\x80\x99s case and Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s case were identical.  The contracts included a clause requiring the parties to arbitrate all disputes, other than claims to col- lect late payments owed by the patient.  The contracts included a provision holding the party filing the arbitration responsible for paying a filing fee in accordance with the Rules of the American Arbitration Association fee schedules.  The agreement in Marchio\xe2\x80\x99s case also included a clause requiring arbitration but made no exceptions to the arbitration requirement and did not mention filing fees.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn each of the three cases, a family member of a patient who had died sued the nursing home in state court, alleging that negligence caused injuries or harm resulting in death.  A state trial court dismissed the suits by Brown and Taylor based on the agreements to arbitrate.  The Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia consolidated those cases with Marchio\xe2\x80\x99s, which was before the court on other issues.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a decision concerning all three cases, the state court held that \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of public policy under West Virginia law, an arbitration clause in a nursing home admission agreement adopted prior to an occurrence of negligence that results in a personal injury or wrongful death, shall not be enforced to compel arbitration of a dispute concerning the negligence.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brown v. Genesis Healthcare Corp., No. 35494 (W.\xc2\xa0Va., June 29, 2011), App. to Pet. for Cert. in No.\xc2\xa011\xe2\x80\x93391, pp. 85a\xe2\x80\x9386a (hereinafter Pet. App.).  The state court considered whether the state public policy was pre-empted by the FAA.  The state court found unpersuasive this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the FAA, calling it \xe2\x80\x9ctendentious,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 51a, and \xe2\x80\x9ccreated from whole cloth,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 53a.  It later concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress did not intend for the FAA to be, in any way, applicable to personal injury or wrongful death suits that only collaterally derive from a written agreement that evidences a transaction affecting interstate commerce, particularly where the agreement involves a service that is a practical necessity for members of the public,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 84a.  The court thus concluded that the FAA does not pre-empt the state pub- lic policy against predispute arbitration agreements that apply to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe West Virginia court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the FAA was both incorrect and inconsistent with clear instruction in the precedents of this Court.  The FAA provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cwritten provision in .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter arising out of such contract or transaction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n9 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s text includes no exception for personal-injury or wrongful-death claims.  It \xe2\x80\x9crequires courts to enforce the bargain of the parties to arbitrate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. v. Byrd, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213, \n217 (1985)\n.  It \xe2\x80\x9creflects an emphatic federal policy in favor of arbitral dispute resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  KPMG LLP v. Cocchi, 565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (per curiam) (slip op., at 3) (quoting Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614, \n631 (1985)\n; internal quotation marks omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs this Court reaffirmed last Term, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen state law prohibits outright the arbitration of a particular type of claim, the analysis is straightforward: The conflicting rule is displaced by the FAA.\xe2\x80\x9d  AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 6\xe2\x80\x937).  That rule resolves these cases.  West Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against predispute agreements to arbitrate personal-injury or wrongful-death claims against nursing homes is a cate- gorical rule prohibiting arbitration of a particular type of claim, and that rule is contrary to the terms and coverage of the FAA.

Pet. App. 89a\xe2\x80\x9391a, 94a.  See also id., at 98a (not addressing the question whether the arbitration agreement in Marchio\xe2\x80\x99s case is unenforceable for reasons other than public policy).  It is unclear, however, to what degree the state court\xe2\x80\x99s alternative holding was influenced by the invalid, categorical rule discussed above, the rule against predispute arbitration agreements.  For example, in its discussion of the alternative holding, the state court found the arbitration clauses unconscionable in part because a predispute arbitration agreement that applies to claims of personal injury or wrongful death against nursing homes \xe2\x80\x9cclearly violates public policy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 91a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOn remand, the West Virginia court must consider whether, absent that general public policy, the arbitration clauses in Brown\xe2\x80\x99s case and Taylor\xe2\x80\x99s case are unenforce- able under state common law principles that are not specific to arbitration and pre-empted by the FAA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe petition for certiorari is granted.
