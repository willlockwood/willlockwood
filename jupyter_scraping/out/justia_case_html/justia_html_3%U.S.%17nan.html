But even if a special court were to be appointed to be held at a distant period, overleaping the stated circuit court, could an indictment found at the latter be prosecuted and tried at the former?  There is a provision</p>\n<p>"that all business depending for trial at any special court shall, at the close thereof, be considered as of course removed to the next stated term of the circuit court."</p>\n<p>2 Vol. Swift\'s Edit., s. 3., p. 227.  But there is no power given to remit to a special court the business depending for trial before the stated circuit court.</p>\n<p>3. And suppose a special circuit court were to be appointed previously to the stated court, could both be in session at the same time?  Or could two grand juries be empanelled at the same time for the same district and both be qualified to present all the offences (including, of course, the offenses of treason) committed within their jurisdiction.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
