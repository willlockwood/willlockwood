RICO also provides a civil cause of action for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation\xe2\x80\x9d of those prohibitions.  \xc2\xa71964(c).</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondents (the European Community and 26 of its member states) filed suit under RICO, alleging that petitioners (RJR Nabisco and related entities (collectively RJR)) participated in a global money-laundering scheme in association with various organized crime groups.  Under the alleged scheme, drug traffickers smuggled narcotics into Europe and sold them for euros that\xe2\x80\x94through transactions involving black-market money brokers, cigarette importers, and wholesalers\xe2\x80\x94were used to pay for large shipments of RJR cigarettes into Europe.  The complaint alleged that RJR violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(a)\xe2\x80\x93(d) by engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity that included numerous predicate acts of money laundering, material support to foreign terrorist organizations, mail fraud, wire fraud, and violations of the Travel Act.  The District Court granted RJR\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss on the ground that RICO does not apply to racketeering activity occurring outside U.\xc2\xa0S. territory or to foreign enterprises.  The Second Circuit reinstated the claims, however, concluding that RICO applies extraterritorially to the same extent as the predicate acts of racketeering that underlie the alleged RICO violation, and that certain predicates alleged in this case expressly apply extraterritorially.  In denying rehearing, the court held further that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s civil action does not require a domestic injury, but permits recovery for a foreign injury caused by the violation of a predicate statute that applies extraterritorially.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>: </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0The law of extraterritoriality provides guidance in determining RICO\xe2\x80\x99s reach to events outside the United States.  The Court applies a canon of statutory construction known as the presumption against extraterritoriality: Absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.  <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>National Australia Bank Ltd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247\n.  <i>Morrison </i>and <i>Kiobel</i> v. <i>Royal Dutch Petroleum Co.</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, reflect a two-step framework for analyzing extraterritoriality issues.  First, the Court asks whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e.,</i> whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially.  This question is asked regardless of whether the particular statute regulates conduct, affords relief, or merely confers jurisdiction.  If, and only if, the statute is not found extraterritorial at step one, the Court moves to step two, where it examines the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d to determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute.  If the conduct relevant to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad; but if the relevant conduct occurred in a foreign country, then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of whether other conduct occurred in U.\xc2\xa0S. territory.  In the event the statute is found to have clear extraterritorial effect at step one, then the statute\xe2\x80\x99s scope turns on the limits Congress has or has not imposed on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s foreign application, and not on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0The presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted with respect to certain applications of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions in \xc2\xa71962.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0RICO defines racketeering activity to include a number of predicates that plainly apply to at least some foreign conduct, such as the prohibition against engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property, \xc2\xa71957(d)(2), the prohibitions against the assassination of Government officials, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7351(i), 1751(k), and the prohibition against hostage taking, \xc2\xa71203(b).  Congress has thus given a clear, affirmative indication that \xc2\xa71962 applies to foreign racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x94but only to the extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply extraterritorially.  This fact is determinative as to \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c), which both prohibit the employment of a pattern of racketeering.  But \xc2\xa71962(a), which targets certain uses of income derived from a pattern of racketeering, arguably extends only to domestic uses of that income.  Because the parties have not focused on this issue, and because its resolution does not affect this case, it is assumed that respondents have pleaded a domestic investment of racketeering income in violation of \xc2\xa71962(a).  It is also assumed that the extraterritoriality of a violation of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy provision, \xc2\xa71962(d), tracks that of the RICO provision underlying the alleged conspiracy.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0RJR contends that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d is its enterprise element, which gives no clear indication of extraterritorial effect.  But focus is considered only when it is necessary to proceed to the inquiry\xe2\x80\x99s second step.  See <i>Morrison, supra, </i>at 267, n.\xc2\xa09.  Here, however, there is a clear indication at step one that at least \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c) apply to all transnational patterns of racketeering, subject to the stated limitation.  A domestic enterprise requirement would lead to difficult line-drawing problems and counterintuitive results, such as excluding from RICO\xe2\x80\x99s reach foreign enterprises that operate within the United States.  Such troubling consequences reinforce the conclusion that Congress intended the \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c) prohibitions to apply extraterritorially in tandem with the underlying predicates, without regard to the locus of the enterprise.  Of course, foreign enterprises will qualify only if they engage in, or significantly affect, commerce directly involving the United States.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Applying these principles here, respondents\xe2\x80\x99 allegations that RJR violated \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c) do not involve an impermissibly extraterritorial application of RICO.  The Court assumes that the alleged pattern of racketeering activity consists entirely of predicate offenses that were either committed in the United States or committed in a foreign country in violation of a predicate statute that applies extraterritorially.  The alleged enterprise also has a sufficient tie to U.\xc2\xa0S. commerce, as its members include U.\xc2\xa0S. companies and its activities depend on sales of RJR\xe2\x80\x99s cigarettes conducted through \xe2\x80\x9cthe U.\xc2\xa0S. mails and wires,\xe2\x80\x9d among other things.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">3.\xc2\xa0Irrespective of any extraterritoriality of \xc2\xa71962\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions, \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality, and thus a private RICO plaintiff must allege and prove a domestic injury.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit reasoned that the presumption against extraterritoriality did not apply to \xc2\xa71964(c) independently of its application to \xc2\xa71962\xe2\x80\x99s substantive provisions because \xc2\xa71964(c) does not regulate conduct.  But this view was rejected in <i>Kiobel</i>,<b> </b>569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, and the logic of that decision requires that the presumption be applied separately to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action even though it has been overcome with respect to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions.  As in other contexts, allowing recovery for foreign injuries in a civil RICO action creates a danger of international friction that militates against recognizing foreign-injury claims without clear direction from Congress.  Respondents, in arguing that such concerns are inapplicable here because the plaintiffs are not foreign citizens seeking to bypass their home countries\xe2\x80\x99 less generous remedies but are foreign countries themselves, forget that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s injury requirement will necessarily govern suits by nongovernmental plaintiffs.  The Court will not forgo the presumption against extraterritoriality to permit extraterritorial suits based on a case-by-case inquiry that turns on or looks to the affected sovereign\xe2\x80\x99s consent. Nor will the Court adopt a double standard that would treat suits by foreign sovereigns more favorably than other suits.  Pp.\xc2\xa018\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Section 1964(c) does not provide a clear indication that Congress intended to provide a private right of action for injuries suffered outside of the United States.  It provides a cause of action to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property\xe2\x80\x9d by a violation of \xc2\xa71962, but neither the word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d nor the reference to injury to \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness or property\xe2\x80\x9d indicates extraterritorial application.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.  In particular, while they are correct that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action was modeled after \xc2\xa74 of the Clayton Act, which allows recovery for injuries suffered abroad as a result of antitrust violations, see <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n\xe2\x80\x93315, this Court has declined to transplant features of the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action into the RICO context where doing so would be inappropriate.  Cf. <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479\n.  There is good reason not to do so here.  Most importantly, RICO lacks the very language that the Court found critical to its decision in <i>Pfizer, </i>namely, the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d who may sue, which \xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly includes \xe2\x80\x98corporations and associations existing under or authorized by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the laws of any foreign country,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313.  Congress\xe2\x80\x99s more recent decision to exclude from the antitrust laws\xe2\x80\x99 reach most conduct that \xe2\x80\x9ccauses only foreign injury,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>F.\xc2\xa0Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd</i> v. <i>Empagran S.\xc2\xa0A.</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 155\n, also counsels against importing into RICO those Clayton Act principles that are at odds with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s current extraterritoriality doctrine.  Pp.\xc2\xa022\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Section 1964(c) requires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.  Respondents waived their domestic injury damages claims, so the District Court dismissed them with prejudice.  Their remaining RICO damages claims therefore rest entirely on injury suffered abroad and must be dismissed.

The statute defines \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d to encompass dozens of state and federal offenses, known in RICO parlance as predicates.  These predicates include any act \xe2\x80\x9cindictable\xe2\x80\x9d under specified federal statutes, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71961(1)(B)\xe2\x80\x93(C), (E)\xe2\x80\x93(G), as well as certain crimes \xe2\x80\x9cchargeable\xe2\x80\x9d under state law, \xc2\xa71961(1)(A), and any offense involving bankruptcy or securities fraud or drug-related activity that is \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d under federal law, \xc2\xa71961(1)(D).  A predicate offense implicates RICO when it is part of a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern<i> </i>of racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a series of related predicates that together demonstrate the existence or threat of continued criminal activity.  <i>H.

Section 1962(a) makes it unlawful to invest income derived from a pattern of racketeering activity in an enterprise.  Section 1962(b) makes it unlawful to acquire or maintain an interest in an enterprise through a pattern of racketeering activity.  Section 1962(c) makes it unlawful for a person employed by or associated with an enterprise to conduct the enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs through a pattern of racketeering activity.  Finally, \xc2\xa71962(d) makes it unlawful to conspire to violate any of the other three prohibitions.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Violations of \xc2\xa71962 are subject to criminal penalties, \xc2\xa71963(a), and civil proceedings to enforce those prohibitions may be brought by the Attorney General, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71964(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  Separately, RICO creates a private civil cause of action that allows \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962\xe2\x80\x9d to sue in federal district court and recover treble damages, costs, and attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fees.  \xc2\xa71964(c).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">This case arises from allegations that petitioners\xe2\x80\x94RJR Nabisco and numerous related entities (collectively RJR)\xe2\x80\x94participated in a global money-laundering scheme in association with various organized crime groups.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x94the European Community and 26 of its member states\xe2\x80\x94first sued RJR in the Eastern District of New York in 2000, alleging that RJR had violated RICO.  Over the past 16 years, the resulting litigation (spread over at least three separate actions, with this case the lone survivor) has seen multiple complaints and multiple trips up and down the federal court system.

In the interest of brevity, we confine our discussion to the operative complaint and its journey to this Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Greatly simplified, the complaint alleges a scheme in which Colombian and Russian drug traffickers smuggled narcotics into Europe and sold the drugs for euros that\xe2\x80\x94through a series of transactions involving black-market money brokers, cigarette importers, and wholesalers\xe2\x80\x94were used to pay for large shipments of RJR cigarettes into Europe.  In other variations of this scheme, RJR allegedly dealt directly with drug traffickers and money launderers in South America and sold cigarettes to Iraq in violation of international sanctions.  RJR is also said to have acquired Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corporation for the purpose of expanding these illegal activities.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The complaint alleges that RJR engaged in a pattern of racketeering activity consisting of numerous acts of money laundering, material support to foreign terrorist organizations, mail fraud, wire fraud, and violations of the Travel Act.  RJR, in concert with the other participants in the scheme, allegedly formed an association in fact that was engaged in interstate and foreign commerce, and therefore constituted a RICO enterprise that the complaint dubs the \xe2\x80\x9cRJR Money-Laundering Enterprise.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 238a, Complaint \xc2\xb6158; see \xc2\xa71961(4) (defining an enterprise to include \xe2\x80\x9cany union or group of individuals associated in fact although not a legal entity\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Putting these pieces together, the complaint alleges that RJR violated each of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions.  RJR allegedly used income derived from the pattern of racketeering to invest in, acquire an interest in, and operate the RJR Money-Laundering Enterprise in violation of \xc2\xa71962(a); acquired and maintained control of the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering in violation of \xc2\xa71962(b); operated the enterprise through the pattern of racketeering in violation of \xc2\xa71962(c); and conspired with other participants in the scheme in violation of \xc2\xa71962(d).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  These violations allegedly harmed respondents in various ways, including through competitive harm to their state-owned cigarette businesses, lost tax revenue from black-market cigarette sales, harm to European financial institutions, currency instability, and increased law enforcement costs.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">RJR moved to dismiss the complaint, arguing that RICO does not apply to racketeering activity occurring outside U.\xc2\xa0S. territory or to foreign enterprises.  The District Court agreed and dismissed the RICO claims as impermissibly extraterritorial.  2011 WL 843957, at *7.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Second Circuit reinstated the RICO claims.  It concluded that, \xe2\x80\x9cwith respect to a number of offenses that constitute predicates for RICO liability and are alleged in this case, Congress has clearly manifested an intent that they apply extraterritorially.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d 129, 133 (2014).  \xe2\x80\x9cBy incorporating these statutes into RICO as predicate racketeering acts,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cCongress has clearly communicated its intention that RICO apply to extraterritorial conduct to the extent that extraterritorial violations of these statutes serve as the basis for RICO liability.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 137.  Turning to the predicates alleged in the complaint, the Second Circuit found that they passed muster.  The court concluded that the money laundering and material support of terrorism statutes expressly apply extraterritorially in the circumstances alleged in the complaint.  <i>Id.,</i> at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.  The court held that the mail fraud, wire fraud, and Travel Act statutes do <i>not </i>apply extraterritorially.  <i>Id.,</i> at 141.  But it concluded that the complaint states <i>domestic </i>violations of those predicates because it \xe2\x80\x9callege[s] conduct in the United States that satisfies every essential element\xe2\x80\x9d of those offenses.  <i>Id.,</i> at 142.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">RJR sought rehearing, arguing (among other things) that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s civil cause of action requires a plaintiff to allege a domestic <i>injury</i>, even if a domestic pattern of racketeering or a domestic enterprise is not necessary to make out a violation of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions.

If a foreign injury was caused by the violation of a predicate statute that applies extraterritorially, the court concluded, then the plaintiff may seek recovery for that injury under RICO.  <i>Id.,</i> at 151.

Second, does RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action, contained in \xc2\xa71964(c), apply to injuries that are suffered in foreign countries?  We consider each of these questions in turn.  To guide our inquiry, we begin by reviewing the law of extraterritoriality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is a basic premise of our legal system that, in general, \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States law governs domestically but does not rule the world.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Microsoft Corp.</i> v. <i>AT&amp;T Corp.</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437,\n454 (2007)\n.  This principle finds expression in a canon of statutory construction known as the presumption against extraterritoriality: Absent clearly expressed congressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will be construed to have only domestic application.  <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>National Australia Bank Ltd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247,\n255 (2010)\n.

In <i>Morrison</i>, we addressed the question whether \xc2\xa710(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 applies to misrepresentations made in connection with the purchase or sale of securities traded only on foreign exchanges.  We first examined whether \xc2\xa710(b) gives any clear indication of extraterritorial effect, and found that it does not.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93265.  We then engaged in a separate inquiry to determine whether the complaint before us involved a permissible <i>domestic </i>application of \xc2\xa710(b) because it alleged that some of the relevant misrepresentations were made in the United States.  At this second step, we considered the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98focus\xe2\x80\x99 of congressional concern,\xe2\x80\x9d asking whether \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s focus is \xe2\x80\x9cthe place where the deception originated\xe2\x80\x9d or rather \xe2\x80\x9cpurchases and sale of securities in the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 266.

At the first step, we ask whether the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted\xe2\x80\x94that is, whether the statute gives a clear, affirmative indication that it applies extraterritorially.  We must ask this question regardless of whether the statute in question regulates conduct, affords relief, or merely confers jurisdiction.  If the statute is not extraterritorial, then at the second step we determine whether the case involves a domestic application of the statute, and we do this by looking to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus.\xe2\x80\x9d  If the conduct relevant to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s focus occurred in the United States, then the case involves a permissible domestic application even if other conduct occurred abroad; but if the conduct relevant to the focus occurred in a foreign country, then the case involves an impermissible extraterritorial application regardless of any other conduct that occurred in U.\xc2\xa0S. territory.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What if we find at step one that a statute clearly <i>does </i>have extraterritorial effect?  Neither <i>Morrison </i>nor <i>Kiobel</i> involved such a finding.  But we addressed this issue in <i>Morrison</i>, explaining that it was necessary to consider \xc2\xa710(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d only because we found that the statute does not apply extraterritorially: \xe2\x80\x9cIf \xc2\xa710(b) did apply abroad, we would not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it would apply to all of them (barring some other limitation).\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267, n.\xc2\xa09.  The scope of an extraterritorial statute thus turns on the limits Congress has (or has not) imposed on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s foreign application, and not on the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">With these guiding principles in mind, we first consider whether RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions in \xc2\xa71962 may apply to foreign conduct.  Unlike in <i>Morrison </i>and <i>Kiobel</i>, we find that the presumption against extraterritoriality has been rebutted\xe2\x80\x94but only with respect to certain applications of the statute.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The most obvious textual clue is that RICO defines racketeering activity to include a number of predicates that plainly apply to at least some foreign conduct.  These predicates include the prohibition against engaging in monetary transactions in criminally derived property, which expressly applies, when \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant is a United States person,\xe2\x80\x9d to offenses that \xe2\x80\x9ctak[e] place outside the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71957(d)(2).  Other examples include the prohibitions against the assassination of Government officials, \xc2\xa7351(i) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is extraterritorial jurisdiction over the conduct prohibited by this section\xe2\x80\x9d); \xc2\xa71751(k) (same), and the prohibition against hostage taking, which applies to conduct that \xe2\x80\x9coccurred outside the United States\xe2\x80\x9d if either the hostage or the offender is a U.\xc2\xa0S. national, if the offender is found in the United States, or if the hostage taking is done to compel action by the U.\xc2\xa0S. Government, \xc2\xa71203(b).  At least one predicate\xe2\x80\x94the prohibition against \xe2\x80\x9ckill[ing] a national of the United States, while such national is outside the United States\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94applies <i>only </i>to conduct occurring outside the United States.  \xc2\xa72332(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We agree with the Second Circuit that Congress\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation of these (and other) extraterritorial predicates into RICO gives a clear, affirmative indication that \xc2\xa71962 applies to foreign racketeering activity\xe2\x80\x94but only to the extent that the predicates alleged in a particular case themselves apply extraterritorially.  Put another way, a pattern of racketeering activity may include or consist of offenses committed abroad in violation of a predicate statute for which the presumption against extraterritoriality has been overcome.  To give a simple (albeit grim) example, a violation of \xc2\xa71962 could be premised on a pattern of killings of Americans abroad in violation of \xc2\xa72332(a)\xe2\x80\x94a predicate that all agree applies extraterritorially\xe2\x80\x94whether or not any domestic predicates are also alleged.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We emphasize the important limitation that foreign conduct must violate \xe2\x80\x9ca predicate statute that manifests an unmistakable congressional intent to apply extraterritorially.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 136.  Although a number of RICO predicates have extraterritorial effect, many do not.  The inclusion of <i>some </i>extraterritorial predicates does not mean that <i>all </i>RICO predicates extend to foreign conduct.  This is apparent for two reasons.  First, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen a statute provides for some extraterritorial application, the presumption against extraterritoriality operates to limit thatprovision to its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 265.  Second, RICO defines as racketeering activity only acts that are \xe2\x80\x9cindictable\xe2\x80\x9d (or, what amounts to the same thing, \xe2\x80\x9cchargeable\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpunishable\xe2\x80\x9d) under one of the statutes identified in \xc2\xa71961(1).  If a particular statute does not apply extraterritorially, then conduct committed abroad is not \xe2\x80\x9cindictable\xe2\x80\x9d under that statute and so cannot qualify as a predicate under RICO\xe2\x80\x99s plain terms.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">RJR resists the conclusion that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s incorporation of extraterritorial predicates gives RICO commensurate extraterritorial effect.  It points out that \xe2\x80\x9cRICO itself\xe2\x80\x9d does not refer to extraterritorial application; only the underlying predicate statutes do.  Brief for Petitioners 42.  RJR thus argues that Congress could have intended to capture only <i>domestic </i>applications of extraterritorial predicates, and that any predicates that apply only abroad could have been \xe2\x80\x9cincorporated .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. solely for when such offenses are part of a broader pattern whose overall locus is domestic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 43.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"> The presumption against extraterritoriality does not require us to adopt such a constricted interpretation.  While the presumption can be overcome only by a clear indication of extraterritorial effect, an express statement of extraterritoriality is not essential.  \xe2\x80\x9cAssuredly context can be consulted as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 265.  Context is dispositive here.  Congress has not expressly said that \xc2\xa71962(c) applies to patterns of racketeering activity in foreign countries, but it has defined \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering activ-ity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and by extension a \xe2\x80\x9cpattern of racketeering activ-ity\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to encompass violations of predicate statutes that <i>do</i> expressly apply extraterritorially.  Short of an explicit declaration, it is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly indicated that it intended RICO to have (some) extraterritorial effect.  This unique structure makes RICO the rare statute that clearly evidences extraterritorial effect despite lacking an express statement of extraterritoriality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We therefore conclude that RICO applies to some foreign racketeering activity.  A violation of \xc2\xa71962 may be based on a pattern of racketeering that includes predicate offenses committed abroad, provided that each of those offenses violates a predicate statute that is itself extraterritorial.  This fact is determinative as to \xc2\xa71962(b) and \xc2\xa71962(c), both of which prohibit the employment of a pattern of racketeering.  Although they differ as to the end for which the pattern is employed\xe2\x80\x94to acquire or maintain control of an enterprise under subsection (b), or to conduct an enterprise\xe2\x80\x99s affairs under subsection (c)\xe2\x80\x94this difference is immaterial for extraterritoriality purposes.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 1962(a) presents a thornier question.  Unlike subsections (b) and (c), subsection (a) targets certain uses of <i>income</i> derived from a pattern of racketeering, not the use of the pattern itself.  Cf. <i>Anza</i> v. <i>Ideal Steel Supply Corp.</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 451\n\xe2\x80\x93462 (2006).  While we have no difficulty concluding that this prohibition applies to income derived from foreign patterns of racketeering (within the limits we have discussed), arguably \xc2\xa71962(a) extends only to domestic uses of the income.  The Second Circuit did not decide this question because it found that respondents have alleged \xe2\x80\x9ca domestic investment of racketeering proceeds in the form of RJR\xe2\x80\x99s merger in the United States with Brown &amp; Williamson and investments in other U.\xc2\xa0S. operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 138, n.\xc2\xa05.  RJR does not dispute the basic soundness of the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning, but it does contest the court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the complaint.  See Brief for Petitioners 57\xe2\x80\x9358.  Because the parties have not focused on this issue, and because it makes no difference to our resolution of this case, see <i>infra</i>, at 27, we assume without deciding that respondents have pleaded a domestic investment of racketeering income in violation of \xc2\xa71962(a).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, although respondents\xe2\x80\x99 complaint alleges a violation of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s conspiracy provision, \xc2\xa71962(d), the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs do not address whether this provision should be treated differently from the provision (\xc2\xa71962(a), (b), or (c)) that a defendant allegedly conspired to violate.  We therefore decline to reach this issue, and assume without deciding that \xc2\xa71962(d)\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritoriality tracks that of the provision underlying the alleged conspiracy.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">RJR contends that, even if RICO may apply to foreign patterns of racketeering, the statute does not apply to foreign <i>enterprises</i>.  Invoking <i>Morrison</i>\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the Exchange Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus,\xe2\x80\x9d RJR says that the \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d of RICO is the enterprise being corrupted\xe2\x80\x94not the pattern of racketeering\xe2\x80\x94and that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s enterprise element gives no clear indication of extraterritorial effect.  Accordingly, RJR reasons, RICO requires a domestic enterprise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This argument misunderstands <i>Morrison</i>.  As explained above, <i>supra</i>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, only at the second step of the inquiry do we consider a statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfocus.\xe2\x80\x9d  Here, however, there is a clear indication at step one that RICO applies extraterritorially.  We therefore do not proceed to the \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d step.  The <i>Morrison </i>Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion<i> </i>of the statutory \xe2\x80\x9cfocus\xe2\x80\x9d made this clear, stating that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f \xc2\xa710(b) did apply abroad, we would not need to determine which transnational frauds it applied to; it would apply to all of them (barring some other limitation).\xe2\x80\x9d  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 267, n.\xc2\xa09.  The same is true here.  RICO\xe2\x80\x94or at least \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c)\xe2\x80\x94applies abroad, and so we do not need to determine which transnational (or wholly foreign) patterns of racketeering it applies to; it applies to all of them, regardless of whether they are connected to a \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic\xe2\x80\x9d enterprise.  This rule is, of course, subject to the important limitation that RICO covers foreign predicate offenses only to the extent that the underlying predicate statutes are extraterritorial.  But within those bounds, the location of the affected enterprise does not impose an independent constraint.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is easy to see why Congress did not limit RICO to domestic enterprises.  A domestic enterprise requirement would lead to difficult line-drawing problems and counterintuitive results.  It would exclude from RICO\xe2\x80\x99s reach foreign enterprises\xe2\x80\x94whether corporations, crime rings, other associations, or individuals\xe2\x80\x94that operate within the United States.  Imagine, for example, that a foreign corporation has operations in the United States and that one of the corporation\xe2\x80\x99s managers in the United States conducts its U.\xc2\xa0S. affairs through a pattern of extortion and mail fraud.  Such domestic conduct would seem to fall well within what Congress meant to capture in enacting RICO.  Congress, after all, does not usually exempt foreigners acting in the United States from U.\xc2\xa0S. legal requirements.  See 764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 138 (\xe2\x80\x9cSurely the presumption against extraterritorial application of United States laws does not command giving foreigners carte blanche to violate the laws of the United States in the United States\xe2\x80\x9d).  Yet RJR\xe2\x80\x99s theory would insulate this scheme from RICO liability\xe2\x80\x94both civil and criminal\xe2\x80\x94because the enterprise at issue is a foreign, not domestic, corporation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Seeking to avoid this result, RJR offers that any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98emissaries\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a foreign enterprise sends to the United States\xe2\x80\x94such as our hypothetical U.\xc2\xa0S.-based corporate manager\xe2\x80\x94could be carved off and considered a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct domestic enterprise\xe2\x80\x9d under an association-in-fact theory.  Brief for Petitioners 40.  RJR\xe2\x80\x99s willingness to gerrymander the enterprise to get around its proposed domestic enterprise requirement is telling.  It suggests that RJR is not really concerned about whether an enterprise is foreign or domestic, but whether the relevant conduct occurred here or abroad.  And if that is the concern, then it is the pattern of racketeering activity that matters, not the enterprise.  Even spotting RJR its \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic emissary\xe2\x80\x9d theory, this approach would lead to strange gaps in RICO\xe2\x80\x99s coverage.  If a foreign enterprise sent only a single \xe2\x80\x9cemissary\xe2\x80\x9d to engage in racketeering in the United States, there could be no RICO liability because a single person cannot be both the RICO enterprise and the RICO defendant.  <i>Cedric Kushner Promotions, Ltd.</i> v. <i>King</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 158,\n162 (2001)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">RJR also offers no satisfactory way of determining whether an enterprise is foreign or domestic.  Like the District Court, RJR maintains that courts can apply the \xe2\x80\x9cnerve center\xe2\x80\x9d test that we use to determine a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s principal place of business for purposes of federal diversity jurisdiction.  See <i>Hertz Corp.</i> v. <i>Friend</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 77 (2010)\n;\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(c)(1); 2011 WL 843957, at *5\xe2\x80\x93*6.  But this test quickly becomes meaningless if, as RJR suggests, a corporation with a foreign nerve center can, if necessary, be pruned into an association-in-fact enterprise with a domestic nerve center.  The nerve center test, developed with ordinary corporate command structures in mind, is also ill suited to govern RICO association-in-fact enterprises, which \xe2\x80\x9cneed not have a hierarchical structure or a \xe2\x80\x98chain of command.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Boyle</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938,\n948 (2009)\n.  These difficulties are largely avoided if, as we conclude today, RICO\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial effect is pegged to the extraterritoriality judgments Congress has made in the predicate statutes, often by providing precise instructions as to when those statutes apply to foreign conduct.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The practical problems we have identified with RJR\xe2\x80\x99s proposed domestic enterprise requirement are not, by themselves, cause to reject it.  Our point in reciting these troubling consequences of RJR\xe2\x80\x99s theory is simply to reinforce our conclusion, based on RICO\xe2\x80\x99s text and context, that Congress intended the prohibitions in 18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c) to apply extraterritorially in tandem with the underlying predicates, without regard to the locus of the enterprise.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although we find that RICO imposes no domestic enterprise requirement, this does not mean that every foreign enterprise will qualify.  Each of RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions requires proof of an enterprise that is \xe2\x80\x9cengaged in, or the activities of which affect, interstate or foreign commerce.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(a), (b), (c).  We do not take this reference to \xe2\x80\x9cforeign commerce\xe2\x80\x9d to mean literally all commerce occurring abroad.  Rather, a RICO enterprise must engage in, or affect in some significant way, commerce directly involving the United States\xe2\x80\x94<i>e.g.,</i> commerce between the United States and a foreign country.  Enterprises whose activities lack that anchor to U.\xc2\xa0S. commerce cannot sustain a RICO violation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying these principles, we agree with the Second Circuit that the complaint does not allege impermissibly extraterritorial violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71962(b) and (c).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The alleged pattern of racketeering activity consists of five basic predicates: (1) money laundering, (2) material support of foreign terrorist organizations, (3) mail fraud, (4) wire fraud, and (5) violations of the Travel Act.  The Second Circuit observed that the relevant provisions of the money laundering and material support of terrorism statutes expressly provide for extraterritorial application in certain circumstances, and it concluded that those circumstances are alleged to be present here.  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 139\xe2\x80\x93140.  The court found that the fraud statutes and the Travel Act do not contain the clear indication needed to overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.

We therefore assume without deciding that the alleged pattern of racketeering activity consists entirely of predicate offenses that were either committed in the United States or committed in a foreign country in violation of a predicate statute that applies extraterritorially.  The alleged enterprise also has a sufficient tie to U.\xc2\xa0S. commerce, as its members include U.\xc2\xa0S. companies, and its activities depend on sales of RJR\xe2\x80\x99s cigarettes conducted through \xe2\x80\x9cthe U.\xc2\xa0S. mails and wires,\xe2\x80\x9d among other things.

Irrespective of any extraterritorial application of \xc2\xa71962, we conclude that \xc2\xa71964(c) does not overcome the presumption against extraterritoriality.  A private RICO plaintiff therefore must allege and prove a <i>domestic</i> injury to its business or property.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Second Circuit thought that the presumption against extraterritoriality did not apply to \xc2\xa71964(c) independently of its application to \xc2\xa71962, reasoning that the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cis primarily concerned with the question of what <i>conduct</i> falls within a statute\xe2\x80\x99s purview.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 151.  We rejected that view in <i>Kiobel</i>, holding that the presumption \xe2\x80\x9cconstrain[s] courts considering causes of action\xe2\x80\x9d under the ATS, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98strictly jurisdictional\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d statute that \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not directly regulate conduct or afford relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 5).  We reached this conclusion even though the underlying substantive law consisted of well-established norms of international law, which by definition apply beyond this country\xe2\x80\x99s borders.  See <i>id.,</i> at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x937).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same logic requires that we separately apply the presumption against extraterritoriality to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action despite our conclusion that the presumption has been overcome with respect to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions. \xe2\x80\x9cThe creation of a private right of action raises issues beyond the mere consideration whether underlying primary conduct should be allowed or not, entailing, for example, a decision to permit enforcement without the check imposed by prosecutorial discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sosa</i> v. <i>Alvarez-Machain</i>,\n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 692,\n727 (2004)\n.  Thus, as we have observed in other contexts, providing a private civil remedy for foreign conduct creates a potential for international friction beyond that presented by merely applying U.\xc2\xa0S. substantive law to that foreign conduct.

This is not to say that friction would necessarily result in every case, or that Congress would violate international law by permitting such suits.

Although \xe2\x80\x9ca risk of conflict between the American statute and a foreign law\xe2\x80\x9d is not a prerequisite for applying the presumption against extraterritoriality,<i> Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255, where such a risk is evident, the need to enforce the presumption is at its apex.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents urge that concerns about international friction are inapplicable in this case because here the plaintiffs are not foreign citizens seeking to bypass their home countries\xe2\x80\x99 less generous remedies but rather the foreign countries themselves.

Respondents assure us that they \xe2\x80\x9care satisfied that the[ir] complaint .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. comports with limitations on prescriptive jurisdiction under international law and respects the dignity of foreign sovereigns.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  Even assuming that this is true, however, our interpretation of \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s injury requirement will necessarily govern suits by nongovernmental plaintiffs that are not so sensitive to foreign sovereigns\xe2\x80\x99 dignity.  We reject the notion that we should forgo the presumption against extraterritoriality and instead permit extraterritorial suits based on a case-by-case inquiry that turns on or looks to the consent of the affected sovereign.  See <i>Morrison</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 261 (\xe2\x80\x9cRather than guess anew in each case, we apply the presumption in all cases\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>Empagran</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 168.  Respondents suggest that we should be reluctant to permit a foreign corporation to be sued in the courts of this country for events occurring abroad if the nation of incorporation objects, but that we should discard those reservations when a foreign state sues a U.\xc2\xa0S. entity in this country under U.\xc2\xa0S. law\xe2\x80\x94instead of in its own courts and under its own laws\xe2\x80\x94for conduct committed on its own soil.  We refuse to adopt this double standard.  \xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, in the law, what is sauce for the goose is normally sauce for the gander.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Heffernan</i> v. <i>City of Paterson</i>, 578 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 6).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Nothing in \xc2\xa71964(c) provides a clear indication that Congress intended to create a private right of action for injuries suffered outside of the United States.  The statute provides a cause of action to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property\xe2\x80\x9d by a violation of \xc2\xa71962.  \xc2\xa71964(c).  The word \xe2\x80\x9cany\xe2\x80\x9d ordinarily connotes breadth, but it is insufficient to displace the presumption against extraterritoriality.  See <i>Kiobel</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 7).  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s reference to injury to \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness or property\xe2\x80\x9d also does not indicate extraterritorial application.  If anything, by cabining RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action to particular kinds of injury\xe2\x80\x94excluding, for example, personal injuries\xe2\x80\x94Congress signaled that the civil remedy is not coextensive with \xc2\xa71962\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions.  The rest of \xc2\xa71964(c) places a limit on RICO plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 ability to rely on securities fraud to make out a claim.  This too suggests that \xc2\xa71964(c) is narrower in its application than \xc2\xa71962, and in any event does not support extraterritoriality.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Second Circuit did not identify anything in \xc2\xa71964(c) that shows that the statute reaches foreign injuries.  Instead, the court reasoned that \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s extraterritorial effect flows directly from that of \xc2\xa71962.  Citing our holding in <i>Sedima, S. P. R. L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479 (1985)\n, that the \xe2\x80\x9ccompensable injury\xe2\x80\x9d addressed by \xc2\xa71964(c) \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily is the harm caused by predicate acts sufficiently related to constitute a pattern,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.</i>, at 497, the Court of Appeals held that a RICO plaintiff may sue for foreign injury that was caused by the violation of a predicate statute that applies extraterritorially, just as a substantive RICO violation may be based on extraterritorial predicates.  764 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 151.  Justice Ginsburg advances the same theory.  See <i>post, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x935 (opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part).  This reasoning has surface appeal, but it fails to appreciate that the presumption against extraterritoriality must be applied separately to both RICO\xe2\x80\x99s substantive prohibitions and its private right of action.  See <i>supra, </i>at 18\xe2\x80\x9322.  It is not enough to say that a private right of action must reach abroad because the underlying law governs conduct in foreign countries.  Something more is needed, and here it is absent.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents contend that background legal principles allow them to sue for foreign injuries, invoking what they call the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98traditional rule\xe2\x80\x99 that \xe2\x80\x98a plaintiff injured in a foreign country\xe2\x80\x99 could bring suit \xe2\x80\x98in American courts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents 41 (quoting <i>Sosa</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 706\xe2\x80\x93707).  But the rule respondents invoke actually provides that a court will ordinarily \xe2\x80\x9capply <i>foreign</i> law to determine the tortfeasor\xe2\x80\x99s liability\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9ca plaintiff injured in a foreign country.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 706 (emphasis added).  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 argument might have force if they sought to sue RJR for violations of <i>their own laws</i> and to invoke federal diversity jurisdiction as a basis for proceeding in U.\xc2\xa0S. courts.  See U.\xc2\xa0S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0III, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe judicial Power [of the United States] shall extend .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to Controversies .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. between a State, or the Citizens thereof, and foreign States\xe2\x80\x9d);\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71332(a)(4) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions where the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or value of $75,000 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and is between .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a foreign state .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as plaintiff and citizens of a State or of different States\xe2\x80\x9d).  The question here, however, is not \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a federal court has jurisdiction to entertain a cause of action provided by foreign or even international law.  The question is instead whether the court has authority to recognize a cause of action <i>under U.\xc2\xa0S. law</i>\xe2\x80\x9d for injury suffered overseas.  <i>Kiobel</i>, <i>supra</i>, at ___ (slip op., at 8) (emphasis added).  As to that question, the relevant background principle is the presumption against extraterritoriality, not the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional rule\xe2\x80\x9d respondents cite.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents and Justice Ginsburg point out that RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action was modeled after \xc2\xa74 of the Clayton Act,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715; see <i>Holmes</i> v. <i>Securities Investor Protection Corporation</i>,\n\n503 U.\xc2\xa0S. 258\n\xe2\x80\x93268 (1992), which we have held allows recovery for injuries suffered abroad as a result of antitrust violations, see <i>Pfizer Inc.</i> v. <i>Government of India</i>,\n\n434 U.\xc2\xa0S. 308\n\xe2\x80\x93315 (1978).  It follows, respondents and Justice Ginsburg contend, that \xc2\xa71964(c) likewise allows plaintiffs to sue for injuries suffered in foreign countries.  We disagree.  Al-though we have often looked to the Clayton Act for guidance in construing \xc2\xa71964(c), we have not treated the two statutes as interchangeable.  We have declined to transplant features of the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action into the RICO context where doing so would be inappropriate.  For example, in <i>Sedima</i> we held that a RICO plaintiff need not allege a special \xe2\x80\x9cracketeering injury,\xe2\x80\x9d rejecting a requirement that some lower courts had adopted by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]nalog[y]\xe2\x80\x9d to the \xe2\x80\x9cantitrust injury\xe2\x80\x9d required under the Clayton Act.  473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 485, 495.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is good reason not to interpret \xc2\xa71964(c) to cover foreign injuries just because the Clayton Act does so.  When we held in <i>Pfizer</i> that the Clayton Act allows recovery for foreign injuries, we relied first and foremost on the fact that the Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s definition of \xe2\x80\x9cperson\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which in turn defines who may sue under that Act\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly includes \xe2\x80\x98corporations and associations existing under or authorized by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the laws of any foreign country.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313; see\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa712.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  RICO lacks the language that the <i>Pfizer </i>Court found critical.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71961(3).[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  To the extent that the <i>Pfizer</i> Court cited other factors that might apply to \xc2\xa71964(c), they were not sufficient in themselves to show that the provision has extraterritorial effect.  For example, the <i>Pfizer </i>Court, writing before we honed our extraterritoriality jurisprudence in <i>Morrison</i> and<i> Kiobel</i>, reasoned that Congress \xe2\x80\x9c[c]learly .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. did not intend to make the [Clayton Act\xe2\x80\x99s] treble-damages remedy available only to consumers in our own country\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9cthe antitrust laws extend to trade \xe2\x80\x98with foreign nations\xe2\x80\x99 as well as among the several States of the Union.\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 313\xe2\x80\x93314.  But we have emphatically rejected reliance on such language, holding that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98even statutes .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that expressly refer to \xe2\x80\x9c<i>foreign </i>commerce\xe2\x80\x9d do not apply abroad.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 262\xe2\x80\x93263.  This reasoning<i> </i>also fails to distinguish between extending <i>substantive antitrust law </i>to foreign conduct and extending a <i>private right of action </i>to foreign injuries, two separate issues that, as we have explained, raise distinct extraterritoriality problems.  See <i>supra,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9322.  Finally, the <i>Pfizer</i> Court expressed concern that it would \xe2\x80\x9cdefeat th[e] purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of the antitrust laws if a defendant could \xe2\x80\x9cescape full liability for his illegal actions.\xe2\x80\x9d  434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 314.  But this justification was merely an attempt to \xe2\x80\x9cdivin[e] what Congress would have wanted\xe2\x80\x9d had it considered the question of extraterritoriality\xe2\x80\x94an approach we eschewed in <i>Morrison</i>.  561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 261.  Given all this, and in particular the fact that RICO lacks the language that <i>Pfizer </i>found integral to its decision, we decline to extend this aspect of our Clayton Act jurisprudence to RICO\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Underscoring our reluctance to read \xc2\xa71964(c) as broadly as we have read the Clayton Act is Congress\xe2\x80\x99s more recent decision to define precisely the antitrust laws\xe2\x80\x99 extraterritorial effect and to exclude from their reach most conduct that \xe2\x80\x9ccauses only foreign injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Empagran</i>, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 158 (describing Foreign Trade Antitrust Improvements Act of 1982); see also <i>id.,</i> at 169\xe2\x80\x93171, 173\xe2\x80\x93174 (discussing how the applicability of the antitrust laws to foreign injuries may depend on whether suit is brought by the Government or by private plaintiffs).  Although this later enactment obviously does not limit \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s scope by its own force, it does counsel against importing into RICO those Clayton Act principles that are at odds with our current extraterritoriality doctrine.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Section 1964(c) requires a civil RICO plaintiff to allege and prove a domestic injury to business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.  The application of this rule in any given case will not always be self-evident, as disputes may arise as to whether a particular alleged injury is \xe2\x80\x9cforeign\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdomestic.\xe2\x80\x9d  But we need not concern ourselves with that question in this case.

See <i>ante, </i>at 4\xe2\x80\x937.  Denying respondents a remedy under RICO, the Court today reads into \xc2\xa71964(c) a domestic-injury requirement for suits by private plaintiffs nowhere indicated in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text.  Correctly, the Court imposes no such restriction on the United States when it initiates a civil suit under \xc2\xa71964(b).  Unsupported by RICO\xe2\x80\x99s text, inconsistent with its pur-poses, and unnecessary to protect the comity interests the Court emphasizes, the domestic-injury requirement for private suits replaces Congress\xe2\x80\x99 prescription with one of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own invention.  Because the Court has no authority so to amend RICO, I dissent.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As the Court recounts, <i>ante,</i> at 7,<i> </i>\xe2\x80\x9cCongress ordinarily legislates with respect to domestic, not foreign, matters.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Morrison</i> v. <i>National Australia Bank Ltd.</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247,\n255 (2010)\n.  So recognizing, the Court employs a presumption that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98legislation .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is meant to apply only within the territorial jurisdiction of the United States.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>EEOC</i> v. <i>Arabian American Oil Co.</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 244,\n248 (1991)\n (<i>Aramco</i>)).  But when a statute demonstrates Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative inten[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that the law should apply beyond the borders of the United States, as numerous RICO predicate statutes do, the presumption is rebutted, and the law applies extraterritorially to the extent Congress prescribed.  See <i>Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255 (quoting <i>Aramco</i>, 499 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 248).  The presumption, in short, aims to distinguish instances in which Congress con-sciously designed a statute to reach beyond U.\xc2\xa0S. borders, from those in which nothing plainly signals that Congress directed extraterritorial application.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, the Court properly holds that Congress signaled its \xe2\x80\x9caffirmative inten[t],\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Morrison</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 255, that RICO, in many instances, should apply extraterritorially.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9318; App. to Brief for United States as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 27a\xe2\x80\x9333a.  As the Court relates, see <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9314, Congress deliberately included within RICO\xe2\x80\x99s compass predicate federal offenses that manifestly reach conduct occurring abroad.  See, <i>e.g., </i>\xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71956\xe2\x80\x931957 (money laundering); \xc2\xa72339B (material support to foreign terrorist organizations).  Accordingly, the Court concludes, when the predicate crimes underlying invocation of \xc2\xa71962 thrust extraterritorially, so too does \xc2\xa71962.  I agree with that conclusion. </p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I disagree, however, that the private right of action authorized by \xc2\xa71964(c) requires a domestic injury to a person\xe2\x80\x99s business or property and does not allow recovery for foreign injuries.  One cannot extract such a limitation from the text of \xc2\xa71964(c), which affords a right of action to \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of section 1962.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 1962, at least subsections (b) and (c), all agree, encompasses foreign injuries.  How can \xc2\xa71964(c) exclude them when, by its express terms, \xc2\xa71964(c) is triggered by \xe2\x80\x9ca violation of section 1962\xe2\x80\x9d?  To the extent RICO reaches injury abroad when the Government is the suitor pursuant to \xc2\xa71962 (specifying prohibited activities) and \xc2\xa71963 (criminal penalties) or \xc2\xa71964(b) (civil remedies), to that same extent, I would hold, RICO reaches extraterritorial injury when, pursuant to \xc2\xa71964(c), the suitor is a private plaintiff.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I would not distinguish, as the Court does, between the extraterritorial compass of a private right of action and that of the underlying proscribed conduct.  See <i>ante,</i> at 18\xe2\x80\x9322, 23, 26.  Instead, I would adhere to precedent addressing RICO, linking, not separating, prohibited activities and authorized remedies.  See <i>Sedima, S.\xc2\xa0P. \xc2\xa0R. \xc2\xa0L.</i> v. <i>Imrex Co.</i>,\n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 479,\n495 (1985)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIf the defendant engages in a pattern of racketeering activity in a manner forbidden by [\xc2\xa71962], and the racketeering activities injure the plaintiff in his business or property, the plaintiff has a claim under \xc2\xa71964(c).\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>ibid.</i> (refusing to require a \xe2\x80\x9cdistinct \xe2\x80\x98racketeering injury\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for private RICO actions under \xc2\xa71964(c) where \xc2\xa71962 imposes no such requirement).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To reiterate, a \xc2\xa71964(c) right of action may be maintained by \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person injured in his business or property by reason of a violation of <i>section 1962</i>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added).  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]ncorporating one statute .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. into another,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court has long understood, \xe2\x80\x9cserves to bring into the latter all that is fairly covered by the reference.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Panama R. Co.</i> v. <i>Johnson</i>,\n\n264 U.\xc2\xa0S. 375,\n392 (1924)\n.  RICO\xe2\x80\x99s private right of action, it cannot be gainsaid, expressly incorporates \xc2\xa71962, whose extraterritoriality, the Court recognizes, is coextensive with the underlying predicate offenses charged.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9318.  See also <i>ante,</i> at 12 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is hard to imagine how Congress could have more clearly indicated that it intended RICO to have (some) extraterritorial effect.\xe2\x80\x9d).  The sole additional condition \xc2\xa71964(c) imposes on access to relief is an injury to one\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbusiness or property.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nothing in that condition should change the extraterritoriality assessment.  In agreement with the Second Circuit, I would hold that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]f an injury abroad was proximately caused by the violation of a statute which Congress intended should apply to injurious conduct performed abroad, [there is] no reason to import a domestic injury requirement simply because the victim sought redress through the RICO statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  764 F.\xc2\xa03d 149, 151 (2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What \xc2\xa71964(c)\xe2\x80\x99s text conveys is confirmed by its history.  As this Court has repeatedly observed, Congress modeled \xc2\xa71964(c) on \xc2\xa74 of the Clayton Act,\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa715, the private civil-action provision of the federal antitrust laws, which employs nearly identical language: \xe2\x80\x9c[A]ny person who shall be injured in his business or property by reason of anything forbidden in the antitrust laws may sue therefor.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Klehr</i> v. <i>A.\xc2\xa0O.

See, <i>e.g., Klehr</i>, 521 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 188\xe2\x80\x93189 (adopting for private RICO actions Clayton Act \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s ac-crual rule\xe2\x80\x94that a claim accrues when a defendant commits an act that injures a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s business\xe2\x80\x94rather than criminal RICO\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cmost recent, predicate act\xe2\x80\x9d rule);<i> Holmes</i>, 503 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 268 (requiring private plaintiffs under \xc2\xa71964(c), like private plaintiffs under Clayton Act \xc2\xa74, to show proximate cause); <i>Agency Holding Corp.</i> v. <i>Malley-Duff &amp; Associates, Inc.</i>,\n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 143\n\xe2\x80\x93156 (1987) (applying to \xc2\xa71964(c) actions Clayton Act \xc2\xa74\xe2\x80\x99s shorter statute of limitations instead of \xe2\x80\x9ccatchall\xe2\x80\x9d federal statute of limitations applicable to RICO criminal prosecutions).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This very case illustrates why pinning a domestic-injury requirement onto \xc2\xa71964(c) makes little sense.  All defendants are U.\xc2\xa0S. corporations, headquartered in the United States, charged with a pattern of racketeering activity directed and managed from the United States, involving conduct occurring in the United States.  In particular, according to the complaint, defendants received in the United States funds known to them to have been gener-ated by illegal narcotics trafficking and terrorist activity, conduct violative of \xc2\xa71956(a)(2); traveled using the facilities of interstate commerce in furtherance of unlawful activity, in violation of \xc2\xa71952; provided material support to foreign terrorist organizations \xe2\x80\x9cin the United States and elsewhere,\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of \xc2\xa72339B; and used U.

In short, this case has the United States written all over it.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court nevertheless deems a domestic-injury requirement for private RICO plaintiffs necessary to avoid international friction.  See <i>ante,</i> at 20\xe2\x80\x9322.  When the United States considers whether to initiate a prosecution or civil suit, the Court observes, it will take foreign-policy considerations into account, but private parties will not.  It is far from clear, however, that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s blanket rule would ordinarily work to ward off international discord.  Invoking the presumption against extraterritoriality as a bar to <i>any</i> private suit for injuries to business or property abroad, this case suggests, might spark, rather than quell, international strife.  Making such litigation available to domestic but not foreign plaintiffs is hardly solicitous of international comity or respectful of foreign interests.  Cf. <i>Pfizer</i>, 434 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 318\xe2\x80\x93319 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] foreign nation is generally entitled to prosecute any civil claim in the courts of the United States upon the same basis as a domestic corporation or individual might do.  To deny him this privilege would manifest a want of comity and friendly feeling.\xe2\x80\x9d  (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">RICO\xe2\x80\x99s definitional provisions exclude \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ntirely foreign activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  783 F.\xc2\xa03d 123, 143 (Lynch, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc).  Thus no suit under RICO would lie for injuries resulting from \xe2\x80\x9c[a] pattern of murders of Italian citizens committed by members of an Italian organized crime group in Italy.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That is so because \xe2\x80\x9cmurder is a RICO predicate only when it is \xe2\x80\x98chargeable under state law\xe2\x80\x99 or indictable under specific federal statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing \xc2\xa71961(1)(A), (G)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To the extent extraterritorial application of RICO could give rise to comity concerns not present in this case, those concerns can be met through doctrines that serve to block litigation in U.\xc2\xa0S. courts of cases more appropriately brought elsewhere.
