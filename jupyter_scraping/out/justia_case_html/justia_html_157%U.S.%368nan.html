U. Fletcher, mayor of said city, wherein, alleging that he was the owner of property, real and personal, to the amount of $50,000, within said city, and subject to municipal taxation, he prayed that the defendants should be restrained from issuing and disposing of bonds of the city to the amount of one million dollars.  The grounds of relief stated in the bill were that after the qualified electors approved the issue of the bonds payable in lawful money, the city council, by ordinance, provided that it should be payable in gold coin, and that the law under which the question of issuing the bonds had been submitted to the electors was illegal and void because repugnant to the Constitution of the United States.

JUSTICE SHIRAS, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is claimed on behalf of the appellant that the appeal may be sustained in this case because it is one in which the question of the jurisdiction of the court below is in issue, and thus within section five of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891.</p>\n<p>But that section provides that "in such case, the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision," and this record does not disclose any such certificate.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, no course is left open to this Court but to dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction.  Any discussion of this question of practice is rendered unnecessary by the full treatment it received in the recent case of <em>Maynard v. Hecht,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/151/324/case.html">151 U. S. 324</a></span>, wherein it was held that, in the instance of an appeal upon the question of jurisdiction, under the fifth section of the act, a certificate by the circuit court, presenting such question for the determination of this Court, is explicitly and in terms required in order to invoke the exercise by this Court of its </p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 157 U. S. 370</a></p><p> appellate jurisdiction, and that the absence of such certificate is fatal to the maintenance of the appeal.  <em>See likewise Shields v.
