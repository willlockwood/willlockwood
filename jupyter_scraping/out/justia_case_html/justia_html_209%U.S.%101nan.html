The court there reaffirmed the rule, announced in previous cases, that the authority to certify such questions could not be used for the purpose of sending to this Court the whole case, with all its circumstances, for consideration and decision.  <em>Jewell v. Knight,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/123/426/case.html">123 U. S. 426</a></span>; <em>Waterville v.

It does not present a distinct point of law, clearly stated, which can be decided without passing upon the weight or effect of all the evidence out of which the question arises.  The question certified is rather a condensed, argumentative narrative of the facts upon which, in the opinion of the judges of the circuit court of appeals, depends the validity of the livestock contract in suit.  Thus, practically, the whole case is brought here by the certified question, and we are, in effect, asked to indicate what, under all the facts stated, should be the final judgment.  It is, obviously, as if the Court had been asked, generally, upon a statement of all the facts, to determine what, upon those facts, is the law of the case."</p>\n<p><span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/205/444/case.html">205 U.

It is as if the court were asked what, upon the whole case as sent up, should have been the verdict and judgment in the trial court.
