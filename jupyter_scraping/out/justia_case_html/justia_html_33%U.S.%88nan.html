From that judgment of the supreme court, the case came before this Court by writ of error. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="108">Page 33 U. S. 108</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE STORY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the State of Pennsylvania, brought under the twentieth section of the Judiciary Act of 1789, chapter 20.</p>\n<p>The original suit is an ejectment by the defendants in error for certain lands in Lancaster County in the State of Pennsylvania, upon which a final judgment was rendered in their favor.  The facts, so far as they are material to the questions over which this Court has jurisdiction, are these.  On 8 May, 1785, James Mercer and Margaret, his wife, executed a deed of the premises, then being the property of the wife, to Nathan Thompson in fee, who afterwards, on the same day, reconveyed the same to James Mercer the husband in fee, the object of the deeds being to vest the estate in the husband.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="109">Page 33 U. S. 109</a></p><p> The certificate of the acknowledgement of the deed of Mercer and wife to Thompson by the magistrate who took the same does not set forth all the particulars as were required by the law of Pennsylvania of the 24th of February 1770, respecting the acknowledgement of deeds of <em>femes covert.</em>  The Legislature of Pennsylvania, on 26 April, 1826, passed an act the object of which was to cure all defective acknowledgments of this sort and to give them the same efficacy as if they had been originally taken in the proper form.  The plaintiffs in the ejectment claimed title to the premises under James Mercer the husband and the defendants, as heirs at law of his wife, who died without issue.  The ejectment was brought after the passage of the act of 1826.</p>\n<p>In the case of <em>Lessee of Watson and wife v. Bailey,</em> 1 Binney 470, the acknowledgement of this very deed from Mercer and wife to Thompson was held to be fatally defective to pass her title.  But the act of 1826 has been repeatedly held by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania to be constitutional and to give validity to such defective acknowledgements.  It was so held in <em>Barnet v. Barnet,</em> 15 Serg. &amp; R. 72, and <em>Tate &amp; wife v. Stooltzfoos,</em> 16 Serg. &amp; R. 35,  and again, upon solemn deliberation and argument, in the case now before this Court.  The object of the present writ of error is to revise the opinions thus pronounced by the highest state court.</p>\n<p>Our authority to examine into the constitutionality of the act of 1826 extends no further than to ascertain whether it violates the Constitution of the United States, for the question whether it violates the Constitution of Pennsylvania is, upon the present writ of error, not before us.</p>\n<p>The act of 1826 provides</p>\n<p>"That no grant, &amp;c., deed of conveyance, &amp;c., heretofore <em>bona fide</em> made and executed by husband and wife and acknowledged by them before some judge, &amp;c., authorized by law, &amp;c., to take such acknowledgement as aforesaid, before the 1st day of September next shall be deemed, held, or adjudged invalid or defective or insufficient in law or avoided or prejudiced by reason of any informality or omission in setting forth the particulars of the acknowledgement made before such officer as aforesaid in the certificate thereof, but all and every such grant, &amp;c., deed of conveyance, &amp;c., so made, executed, and acknowledged as aforesaid shall be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="110">Page 33 U. S. 110</a></p><p> as good, valid and effectual in law for transferring, passing and conveying the estate, right and title, and interest of such husband and wife of, in, and to the lands, &amp;c., mentioned in the same as if all the requisites and particulars of such acknowledgement mentioned in the act to which this is supplementary were particularly set forth in the certificate thereof or approved upon the face of the same."</p>\n<p>The argument for the plaintiffs in error is first that the act violates the Constitution of the United States because it divests their vested rights as heirs at law of the premises in question, and secondly that it violates the obligation of a contract -- that is, of the patent granted by the proprietaries of Pennsylvania to Samuel Patterson, the ancestor of the original defendants, from whom they trace their title to the premises by descent through Margaret Mercer.</p>\n<p>As to the first point, it is clear that this Court has no right to pronounce an act of the state legislature void as contrary to the Constitution of the United States from the mere fact that it divests antecedent vested rights of property.  The Constitution of the United States does not prohibit the states from passing retrospective laws generally, but only <em>ex post facto</em> laws.  Now it has been solemnly settled by this Court that the phrase "<em>ex post facto</em> laws" is not applicable to civil laws, but to penal and criminal laws, which punish no party for acts antecedently done which were not punishable at all, or not punishable to the extent or in the manner prescribed.  In short, <em>ex post facto</em> laws relate to penal and criminal proceedings which impose punishments or forfeitures, and not to civil proceedings which affect private rights retrospectively.  The cases <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/3/386/case.html">Calder v. Bull,</a></span></em> 3 Dall. 386, 1 Cond. 172; <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/9/115/case.html#138">Fletcher v.

Matthewson,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 380, fully recognize this doctrine.</p>\n<p>In the next place, does the act of 1826 violate the obligation of any contract?  In our judgment, it certainly does not, either in its terms or its principles.  It does not even affect to touch any title acquired by a patent or any other grant.  It supposes the titles of the <em>femes covert</em> to be good, however acquired, and only provides that deeds of conveyance made by them shall not be void, because there is a defective acknowledgement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="111">Page 33 U. S. 111</a></p><p> of the deeds, by which they have sought to transfer their title.  So far, then, as it has any legal operation, it goes to confirm, and not to impair, the contract of the <em>femes covert.</em>  It gives the very effect to their acts and contracts which they intended to give, and which, from mistake or accident, has not been effected.  This point is so fully settled by the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/27/380/case.html">Satterlee v. Matthewson,</a></span></em> 2 Pet. 380, that it is wholly unnecessary to go over the reasoning upon which it is founded.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole, it is the unanimous opinion of the Court there is no error in the judgment of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania so far as it is subject to the revision of this Court, and therefore it is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania for the Lancaster District, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof it is ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said supreme court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
