The Board is composed of five members appointed by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry\xe2\x80\x94such as the New York Stock Exchange\xe2\x80\x94that investigate and discipline their own members subject to Commission oversight.  Unlike these organizations, the Board is a Government-created entity with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.  Every accounting firm that audits public companies under the securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.  The Board may inspect registered firms, initiate formal investigations, and issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings.  The parties agree that the Board is \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the Government\xe2\x80\x9d for constitutional purposes, <em>Lebron</em> v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/374/index.html">513 U. S. 374</a>, 397, and that its members are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Officers of the United States\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 125\xe2\x80\x93126.  While the SEC has oversight of the Board, it cannot remove Board members at will, but only \xe2\x80\x9cfor good cause shown,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin accordance with\xe2\x80\x9d specified procedures.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(e)(6), 7217(d)(3).  The parties also agree that the Commissioners, in turn, cannot themselves be removed by the President except for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/index.html">295 U. S. 602</a>, 620.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board inspected petitioner accounting firm, released a report critical of its auditing procedures, and began a formal investigation.  The firm and petitioner Free Enterprise Fund, a nonprofit organization of which the firm is a member, sued the Board and its members, seeking, <em>inter alia, </em>a declaratory judgment that the Board is unconstitutional and an injunction preventing the Board from exercising its powers.  Petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers by conferring executive power on Board members without subjecting them to Presidential control.  The basis for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge was that Board members were insulated from Presidential control by two layers of tenure protection: Board members could only be removed by the Commission for good cause, and the Commissioners could in turn only be removed by the President for good cause.  Petitioners also challenged the Board\xe2\x80\x99s appointment as violating the Appointments Clause, which requires officers to be appointed by the President with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent, or\xe2\x80\x94in the case of \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94by \xe2\x80\x9cthe President alone, \xe2\x80\xa6 the Courts of Law, or \xe2\x80\xa6 the Heads of Departments,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  The United States intervened to defend the statute.  The District Court found it had jurisdiction and granted summary judgment to respondents.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  It first agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction.  It then ruled that the dual restraints on Board members\xe2\x80\x99 removal are permissible, and that Board members are inferior officers whose appointment is consistent with the Appointments Clause.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held</em>:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa01.\xc2\xa0The District Court had jurisdiction over these claims.  The Commission may review any Board rule or sanction, and an aggrieved party may challenge the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfinal order\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d in a court of appeals under 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778y.  The Government reads \xc2\xa778y as an exclusive route to review, but the text does not expressly or implicitly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.  It is presumed that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if \xe2\x80\x9ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d; if the suit is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wholly \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s review provisions\xe2\x80\x9d; and if the claims are \xe2\x80\x9coutside the agency\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Reich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/200/index.html">510 U. S. 200</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These considerations point against any limitation on review here.  Section 78y provides only for review of <em>Commission</em> action, and petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.  The Government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction, but petitioners have not been sanctioned, and it is no \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful\xe2\x80\x9d avenue of relief, <em>Thunder Basin</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 212, to require a plaintiff to <em>incur</em> a sanction in order to test a law\xe2\x80\x99s validity, <em>MedImmune, Inc.</em> v. <em>Genentech, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/549/118/index.html">549 U. S. 118</a>, 129.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims are also outside the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s competence and expertise, and the statutory questions involved do not require technical considerations of agency policy.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa02.\xc2\xa0The dual for-cause limitations on the removal of Board members contravene the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s separation of powers.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Constitution provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa01.  Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower the President to keep executive officers accountable\xe2\x80\x94by removing them from office, if necessary.  See generally <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/index.html">272 U. S. 52</a>.  This Court has determined that this authority is not without limit.  In <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor, supra,</em> this Court held that Congress can, under certain circumstances, create independent agencies run by principal officers appointed by the President, whom the President may not remove at will but only for good cause.  And in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Perkins</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/116/483/index.html">116 U. S. 483</a>, and <em>Morrison</em> v. <em>Olson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/654/index.html">487 U. S. 654</a>, the Court sustained similar restrictions on the power of principal executive officers\xe2\x80\x94themselves responsible to the President\xe2\x80\x94to remove their own inferiors.  However, this Court has not addressed the consequences of more than one level of good-cause tenure.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Where this Court has upheld limited restrictions on the President\xe2\x80\x99s removal power, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power.  The President\xe2\x80\x94or a subordinate he could remove at will\xe2\x80\x94decided whether the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.  Here, the Act not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists.  That decision is vested in other tenured officers\xe2\x80\x94the Commissioners\xe2\x80\x94who are not subject to the President\xe2\x80\x99s direct control.  Because the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will, the President cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  He can only review the Commissioner\xe2\x80\x99s determination of whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous good-cause standard is met.  And if the President disagrees with that determination, he is powerless to intervene\xe2\x80\x94unless the determination is so unreasonable as to constitute \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 620.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This arrangement contradicts Article II\xe2\x80\x99s vesting of the executive power in the President.  Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board\xe2\x80\x99s failings to those whom he <em>can</em> oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board member\xe2\x80\x99s breach of faith.  If this dispersion of responsibility were allowed to stand, Congress could multiply it further by adding still more layers of good-cause tenure.  Such diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability; without a clear and effective chain of command, the public cannot determine where the blame for a pernicious measure should fall.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s restrictions are therefore incompatible with the Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s separation of powers.  Pp.\xc2\xa014\xe2\x80\x9317.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowsher</em> v. <em>Synar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/index.html">478 U. S. 714</a>, 736.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s multilevel tenure protections provide a blueprint for the extensive expansion of legislative power.  Congress controls the salary, duties, and existence of executive offices, and only Presidential oversight can counter its influence.  The Framers created a structure in which \xe2\x80\x9c[a] dependence on the people\xe2\x80\x9d would be the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary controul on the government,\xe2\x80\x9d and that dependence is maintained by giving each branch \xe2\x80\x9cthe necessary constitutional means and personal motives to resist encroachments of the others.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Federalist No. 51, p. 349.  A key \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional means\xe2\x80\x9d vested in the President was \xe2\x80\x9cthe power of appointing, overseeing, and controlling those who execute the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Congress 463.  While a government of \xe2\x80\x9copposite and rival interests\xe2\x80\x9d may sometimes inhibit the smooth functioning of administration, The Federalist No. 51, at 349, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Framers recognized that, in the long term, structural protections against abuse of power were critical to preserving liberty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowsher</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 730.  Pp.\xc2\xa017\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0The Government errs in arguing that, even if some constraints on the removal of inferior executive officers might violate the Constitution, the restrictions here do not.  There is no construction of the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s good-cause removal power that is broad enough to avoid invalidation.  Nor is the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s broad power over Board <em>functions</em> the equivalent of a power to remove Board <em>members</em>.  Altering the Board\xe2\x80\x99s budget or powers is not a meaningful way to control an inferior officer; the Commission cannot supervise individual Board members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it.  Moreover, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s power over the Board is hardly plenary, as the Board may take significant enforcement actions largely independently of the Commission.  Enacting new SEC rules through the required notice and comment procedures would be a poor means of micromanaging the Board, and without certain findings, the Act forbids any general rule requiring SEC preapproval of Board actions.  Finally, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of good-cause removal.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9327.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa03.\xc2\xa0The unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Champlin Refining Co.</em> v. <em>Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Okla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/index.html">286 U. S. 210</a>, 234, the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthat partial \xe2\x80\xa6 invalidation is the required course,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brockett</em> v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/index.html">472 U. S. 491</a>, 504.  The Board\xe2\x80\x99s existence does not violate the separation of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do.  Concluding that the removal restrictions here are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will.  With the tenure restrictions excised, the Act remains \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fully operative as a law,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a>, 186, and nothing in the Act\xe2\x80\x99s text or historical context makes it \xe2\x80\x9cevident\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will, <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684.  The consequence is that the Board may continue to function as before, but its members may be removed at will by the Commission.

S. 651</a>, 662\xe2\x80\x93663.  Because the good-cause restrictions discussed above are unconstitutional and void, the Commission possesses the power to remove Board members at will, in addition to its other oversight authority.  Board members are therefore directed and supervised by the Commission.  Pp. 29\xe2\x80\x9330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Commission is a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d under the Appointments Clause.  <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html">501 U. S. 868</a>, 887, n. 4, specifically reserved the question whether a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal agenc[y], such as\xe2\x80\x9d the SEC, is a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court now adopts the reasoning of the concurring Justices in <em>Freytag</em>, who would have concluded that the SEC is such a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d because it is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch not subordinate to or contained within any other such component.  This reading is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cdepartment\xe2\x80\x9d; with the early practice of Congress, see \xc2\xa73, 1 Stat. 234; and with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.

The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative functions subject to the full Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  There is no reason why a multimember body may not be the \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that it governs.  The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Law,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02, and each House of Congress appoints its officers collectively, see, <em>e.g., </em>Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa05.

Article II vests \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he executive Power \xe2\x80\xa6 in a President of the United States of America,\xe2\x80\x9d who must \xe2\x80\x9ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art. II, \xc2\xa71, cl.\xc2\xa01; <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa73.  In light of \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he impossibility that one man should be able to perform all the great business of the State,\xe2\x80\x9d the Constitution provides for executive officers to \xe2\x80\x9cassist the supreme Magistrate in discharging the duties of his trust.\xe2\x80\x9d  30 Writings of George Washington 334 (J. Fitzpatrick ed. 1939).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since 1789, the Constitution has been understood to empower the President to keep these officers accountable\xe2\x80\x94by removing them from office, if necessary.  See generally <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/index.html"></a><a href="/us/272/52/index.html">272 U. S. 52</a> (1926).  This Court has determined, however, that this authority is not without limit.

The parties do not ask us to reexamine any of these precedents, and we do not do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are asked, however, to consider a new situation not yet encountered by the Court.  The question is whether these separate layers of protection may be combined.  May the President be restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, who is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an inferior officer, even though that inferior officer determines the policy and enforces the laws of the United States?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that such multilevel protection from removal is contrary to Article II\xe2\x80\x99s vesting of the executive power in the President.  The President cannot \xe2\x80\x9ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed\xe2\x80\x9d if he cannot oversee the faithfulness of the officers who execute them.  Here the President cannot remove an officer who enjoys more than one level of good-cause protection, even if the President determines that the officer is neglecting his duties or discharging them improperly.  That judgment is instead committed to another officer, who may or may not agree with the President\xe2\x80\x99s determination, and whom the President cannot remove simply because that officer disagrees with him.  This contravenes the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional obligation to ensure the faithful execution of the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 693.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After a series of celebrated accounting debacles, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (or Act), 116 Stat. 745.  Among other measures, the Act introduced tighter regulation of the accounting industry under a new Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  The Board is composed of five members, appointed to staggered 5-year terms by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  It was modeled on private self-regulatory organizations in the securities industry\xe2\x80\x94such as the New York Stock Exchange\xe2\x80\x94that investigate and discipline their own members subject to Commission oversight.  Congress created the Board as a private \xe2\x80\x9cnonprofit corporation,\xe2\x80\x9d and Board members and employees are not considered Government \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s] or employee[s]\xe2\x80\x9d for statutory purposes.  15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(a), (b).  The Board can thus recruit its members and employees from the private sector by paying salaries far above the standard Government pay scale.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(f)(4), 7219.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike the self-regulatory organizations, however, the Board is a Government-created, Government-appointed entity, with expansive powers to govern an entire industry.  Every accounting firm\xe2\x80\x94both foreign and domestic\xe2\x80\x94that participates in auditing public companies under the securities laws must register with the Board, pay it an annual fee, and comply with its rules and oversight.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(a), 7212(a), (f), 7213, 7216(a)(1).  The Board is charged with enforcing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the securities laws, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s rules, its own rules, and professional accounting standards.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77215(b)(1), (c)(4).  To this end, the Board may regulate every detail of an accounting firm\xe2\x80\x99s practice, including hiring and professional development, promotion, supervision of audit work, the acceptance of new business and the continuation of old, internal inspection procedures, professional ethics rules, and \xe2\x80\x9csuch other requirements as the Board may prescribe.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77213(a)(2)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Board promulgates auditing and ethics standards, performs routine inspections of all accounting firms, demands documents and testimony, and initiates formal investigations and disciplinary proceedings.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77213\xe2\x80\x937215 (2006 ed. and Supp. II).  The willful violation of any Board rule is treated as a willful violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 48 Stat. 881, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778a <em>et seq.</em>\xe2\x80\x94a federal crime punishable by up to 20 years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment or $25 million in fines ($5 million for a natural person).  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778ff(a), 7202(b)(1) (2006 ed.).  And the Board itself can issue severe sanctions in its disciplinary proceedings, up to and including the permanent revocation of a firm\xe2\x80\x99s registration, a permanent ban on a person\xe2\x80\x99s associating with any registered firm, and money penalties of $15 million ($750,000 for a natural person).  \xc2\xa77215(c)(4).  Despite the provisions specifying that Board members are not Government officials for statutory purposes, the parties agree that the Board is \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the Government\xe2\x80\x9d for constitutional purposes, <em>Lebron</em> v. <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/374/index.html">513 U.

App. 71.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before the District Court, petitioners argued that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act contravened the separation of powers by conferring wide-ranging executive power on Board members without subjecting them to Presidential control.  <em>Id.,</em> at 67\xe2\x80\x9368.  Petitioners also challenged the Act under the Appointments Clause, which requires \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d to be appointed by the President with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  The Clause provides an exception for \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers,\xe2\x80\x9d whose appointment Congress may choose to vest \xe2\x80\x9cin the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Because the Board is appointed by the SEC, petitioners argued that (1) Board members are not \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Officers\xe2\x80\x9d who may be appointed by \xe2\x80\x9cHeads of Departments\xe2\x80\x9d; (2) even if they are, the Commission is not a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) even if it is, the several Commissioners (as opposed to the Chairman) are not its \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d].\xe2\x80\x9d  See App. 68\xe2\x80\x9370.  The United States intervened to defend the Act\xe2\x80\x99s constitutionality.

App. to Pet. for Cert. 110a\xe2\x80\x93117a.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided Court of Appeals affirmed.  537 F.\xc2\xa03d 667 (CADC 2008).  It agreed that the District Court had jurisdiction over petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  <em>Id.,</em> at 671.  On the merits, the Court of Appeals recognized that the removal issue was \xe2\x80\x9ca question of first impression,\xe2\x80\x9d as neither that court nor this one \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] considered a situation where a restriction on removal passes through two levels of control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 679.  It ruled that the dual restraints on Board members\xe2\x80\x99 removal are permissible because they do not \xe2\x80\x9crender the President unable to perform his constitutional duties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 683.  The majority reasoned that although the President \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not directly select or supervise the Board\xe2\x80\x99s members,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 681, the Board is subject to the comprehensive control of the Commission, and thus the President\xe2\x80\x99s influence over the Commission implies a constitutionally sufficient influence over the Board as well.  <em>Id.,</em> at 682\xe2\x80\x93683.  The majority also held that Board members are inferior officers subject to the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s direction and supervision, <em>id.,</em> at 672\xe2\x80\x93676, and that their appointment is otherwise consistent with the Appointments Clause, <em>id.,</em> at 676\xe2\x80\x93678.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Judge Kavanaugh dissented.  He agreed that the case was one of first impression, <em>id.,</em> at 698, but argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthe double for-cause removal provisions in the [Act] \xe2\x80\xa6 combine to eliminate any meaningful Presidential control over the [Board],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 697.  Judge Kavanaugh also argued that Board members are not effectively supervised by the Commission and thus cannot be inferior officers under the Appointments Clause.  <em>Id.,</em> at 709\xe2\x80\x93712.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We granted certiorari.  556 U. S. ___ (2009).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We first consider whether the District Court had jurisdiction.  We agree with both courts below that the statutes providing for judicial review of Commission action did not prevent the District Court from considering petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sarbanes-Oxley Act empowers the Commission to review any Board rule or sanction.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77217(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x93(4), (c)(2).  Once the Commission has acted, aggrieved parties may challenge \xe2\x80\x9ca final order of the Commission\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ca rule of the Commission\xe2\x80\x9d in a court of appeals under \xc2\xa778y, and \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o objection \xe2\x80\xa6 may be considered by the court unless it was urged before the Commission or there was reasonable ground for failure to do so.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778y(a)(1), (b)(1), (c)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government reads \xc2\xa778y as an exclusive route to review.  But the text does not expressly limit the jurisdiction that other statutes confer on district courts.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71331, 2201.  Nor does it do so implicitly.  Provisions for agency review do not restrict judicial review unless the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory scheme\xe2\x80\x9d displays a \xe2\x80\x9cfairly discernible\xe2\x80\x9d intent to limit jurisdiction, and the claims at issue \xe2\x80\x9care of the type Congress intended to be reviewed within th[e] statutory structure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thunder Basin Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Reich</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/510/200/index.html">510 U. S. 200</a>, 207, 212 (1994) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Generally, when Congress creates procedures \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to permit agency expertise to be brought to bear on particular problems,\xe2\x80\x9d those procedures \xe2\x80\x9care to be exclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitney Nat.

But we presume that Congress does not intend to limit jurisdiction if \xe2\x80\x9ca finding of preclusion could foreclose all meaningful judicial review\xe2\x80\x9d; if the suit is \xe2\x80\x9cwholly collateral to a statute\xe2\x80\x99s review provisions\xe2\x80\x9d; and if the claims are \xe2\x80\x9coutside the agency\xe2\x80\x99s expertise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Thunder Basin</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (internal quotation marks omitted).  These considerations point against any limitation on review here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We do not see how petitioners could meaningfully pursue their constitutional claims under the Government\xe2\x80\x99s theory.  Section 78y provides only for judicial review of <em>Commission</em> action, and not every Board action is encapsulated in a final Commission order or rule.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government suggests that petitioners could first have sought Commission review of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauditing standards, registration requirements, or other rules.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 16.  But petitioners object to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s existence, not to any of its auditing standards.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 general challenge to the Board is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d to any Commission orders or rules from which review might be sought.  Cf. <em>McNary</em> v. <em>Haitian Refugee Center, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/479/index.html">498 U. S. 479</a>, 491\xe2\x80\x93492 (1991).  Requiring petitioners to select and challenge a Board rule at random is an odd procedure for Congress to choose, especially because only <em>new</em> rules, and not existing ones, are subject to challenge.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778s(b)(2), 78y(a)(1), 7217(b)(4).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternatively, the Government advises petitioners to raise their claims by appealing a Board sanction.  Brief for United States 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  But the investigation of Beckstead and Watts produced no sanction, see <em>id.,</em> at 7, n.\xc2\xa05; Reply Brief for Petitioners 29, n.\xc2\xa011 (hereinafter Reply Brief), and an uncomplimentary inspection report is not subject to judicial review, see \xc2\xa77214(h)(2).  So the Government proposes that Beckstead and Watts <em>incur</em> a sanction (such as a sizable fine) by ignoring Board requests for documents and testimony.  Brief for United States 17.  If the Commission then affirms, the firm will win access to a court of appeals\xe2\x80\x94and severe punishment should its challenge fail.

That case concerned the Ethics in Government Act, which provided for an independent counsel to investigate allegations of crime by high executive officers.  The counsel was appointed by a special court, wielded the full powers of a prosecutor, and was removable by the Attorney General only \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for good cause.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  487 U.

The Court noted that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cg[a]ve the Attorney General,\xe2\x80\x9d an officer directly responsible to the President and \xe2\x80\x9cthrough [whom]\xe2\x80\x9d the President could act, \xe2\x80\x9cseveral means of supervising or controlling\xe2\x80\x9d the independent counsel\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9c[m]ost importantly \xe2\x80\xa6 the power to remove the counsel for good cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 695\xe2\x80\x93696 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Under those circumstances, the Court sustained the statute.  <em>Morrison</em> did not, however, address the consequences of more than one level of good-cause tenure\xe2\x80\x94leaving the issue, as both the court and dissent below recognized, \xe2\x80\x9ca question of first impression\xe2\x80\x9d in this Court.  537 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 679; see <em>id.,</em> at 698 (dissenting opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As explained, we have previously upheld limited restrictions on the President\xe2\x80\x99s removal power.  In those cases, however, only one level of protected tenure separated the President from an officer exercising executive power.  It was the President\xe2\x80\x94or a subordinate he could remove at will\xe2\x80\x94who decided whether the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct merited removal under the good-cause standard.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Act before us does something quite different.  It not only protects Board members from removal except for good cause, but withdraws from the President any decision on whether that good cause exists.  That decision is vested instead in other tenured officers\xe2\x80\x94the Commissioners\xe2\x80\x94none of whom is subject to the President\xe2\x80\x99s direct control.  The result is a Board that is not accountable to the President, and a President who is not responsible for the Board.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The added layer of tenure protection makes a difference.  Without a layer of insulation between the Commission and the Board, the Commission could remove a Board member at any time, and therefore would be fully responsible for what the Board does.  The President could then hold the Commission to account for its supervision of the Board, to the same extent that he may hold the Commission to account for everything else it does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A second level of tenure protection changes the nature of the President\xe2\x80\x99s review.  Now the Commission cannot remove a Board member at will.  The President therefore cannot hold the Commission fully accountable for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, to the same extent that he may hold the Commission accountable for everything else that it does.  The Commissioners are not responsible for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s actions.  They are only responsible for their own determination of whether the Act\xe2\x80\x99s rigorous good-cause standard is met.  And even if the President disagrees with their determination, he is powerless to intervene\xe2\x80\x94unless that determination is so unreasonable as to constitute \xe2\x80\x9cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em>, 295 U. S., at 620 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This novel structure does not merely add to the Board\xe2\x80\x99s independence, but transforms it.  Neither the President, nor anyone directly responsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct he may review only for good cause, has full control over the Board.  The President is stripped of the power our precedents have preserved, and his ability to execute the laws\xe2\x80\x94by holding his subordinates accountable for their conduct\xe2\x80\x94is impaired.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That arrangement is contrary to Article II\xe2\x80\x99s vesting of the executive power in the President.  Without the ability to oversee the Board, or to attribute the Board\xe2\x80\x99s failings to those whom he <em>can</em> oversee, the President is no longer the judge of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s conduct.  He is not the one who decides whether Board members are abusing their offices or neglecting their duties.  He can neither ensure that the laws are faithfully executed, nor be held responsible for a Board member\xe2\x80\x99s breach of faith.  This violates the basic principle that the President \xe2\x80\x9ccannot delegate ultimate responsibility or the active obligation to supervise that goes with it,\xe2\x80\x9d because Article II \xe2\x80\x9cmakes a single President responsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Clinton</em> v. <em>Jones</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/681/index.html">520 U. S. 681</a>, 712\xe2\x80\x93713 (1997) (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, if allowed to stand, this dispersion of responsibility could be multiplied.  If Congress can shelter the bureaucracy behind two layers of good-cause tenure, why not a third?  At oral argument, the Government was unwilling to concede that even <em>five</em> layers between the President and the Board would be too many.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 47\xe2\x80\x9348.  The officers of such an agency\xe2\x80\x94safely encased within a Matryoshka doll of tenure protections\xe2\x80\x94would be immune from Presidential oversight, even as they exercised power in the people\xe2\x80\x99s name.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps an individual President might find advantages in tying his own hands.  But the separation of powers does not depend on the views of individual Presidents, see <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/868/index.html">501 U. S. 868</a>, 879\xe2\x80\x93880 (1991), nor on whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe encroached-upon branch approves the encroachment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a>, 182 (1992).  The President can always choose to restrain himself in his dealings with subordinates.  He cannot, however, choose to bind his successors by diminishing their powers, nor can he escape responsibility for his choices by pretending that they are not his own.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The diffusion of power carries with it a diffusion of accountability.  The people do not vote for the \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.

That is why the Framers sought to ensure that \xe2\x80\x9cthose who are employed in the execution of the law will be in their proper situation, and the chain of dependence be preserved; the lowest officers, the middle grade, and the highest, will depend, as they ought, on the President, and the President on the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Annals of Cong., at 499 (J. Madison).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By granting the Board executive power without the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s oversight, this Act subverts the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to ensure that the laws are faithfully executed\xe2\x80\x94as well as the public\xe2\x80\x99s ability to pass judgment on his efforts.

And the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fact that a given law or procedure is efficient, convenient, and useful in facilitating functions of government, standing alone, will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[c]onvenience and efficiency are not the primary objectives\xe2\x80\x94or the hallmarks\xe2\x80\x94of democratic government.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bowsher</em>, 478 U.

Our Constitution was adopted to enable the people to govern themselves, through their elected leaders.  The growth of the Executive Branch, which now wields vast power and touches almost every aspect of daily life, heightens the concern that it may slip from the Executive\xe2\x80\x99s control, and thus from that of the people.  This concern is largely absent from the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s paean to the administrative state.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, the dissent dismisses the importance of removal as a tool of supervision, concluding that the President\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpower to get something done\xe2\x80\x9d more often depends on \xe2\x80\x9cwho controls the agency\xe2\x80\x99s budget requests and funding, the relationships between one agency or department and another, \xe2\x80\xa6 purely political factors (including Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to assert influence),\xe2\x80\x9d and indeed whether particular <em>unelected</em> officials support or \xe2\x80\x9cresist\xe2\x80\x9d the President\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  <em>Post,</em> at 11, 13 (emphasis deleted).

The point is not to take issue with for-cause limitations in general; we do not do that.  The question here is far more modest.

The President might have less than full confidence in, say, a Board member who cheats on his taxes; but that discovery is not listed among the grounds for removal under \xc2\xa77217(d)(3).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The rigorous standard that must be met before a Board member may be removed was drawn from statutes concerning private organizations like the New York Stock Exchange.  Cf. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778s(h)(4), 7217(d)(3).  While we need not decide the question here, a removal standard appropriate for limiting Government control over private bodies may be inappropriate for officers wielding the executive power of the United States.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Alternatively, respondents portray the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitations on removal as irrelevant, because\xe2\x80\x94as the Court of Appeals held\xe2\x80\x94the Commission wields \xe2\x80\x9cat-will removal power over Board <em>functions</em> if not Board members.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 683 (emphasis added); accord, Brief for United States 27\xe2\x80\x9328; PCAOB Brief 48.  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s general \xe2\x80\x9coversight and enforcement authority over the Board,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77217(a), is said to \xe2\x80\x9cblun[t] the constitutional impact of for-cause removal,\xe2\x80\x9d 537 F. 3d, at 683, and to leave the President no worse off than \xe2\x80\x9cif Congress had lodged the Board\xe2\x80\x99s functions in the SEC\xe2\x80\x99s own staff,\xe2\x80\x9d PCAOB Brief 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Broad power over Board functions is not equivalent to the power to remove Board members.  The Commission may, for example, approve the Board\xe2\x80\x99s budget, \xc2\xa77219(b), issue binding regulations, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77202(a), 7217(b)(5), relieve the Board of authority, \xc2\xa77217(d)(1), amend Board sanctions, \xc2\xa77217(c), or enforce Board rules on its own, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77202(b)(1), (c).  But altering the budget or powers of an agency as a whole is a problematic way to control an inferior officer.  The Commission cannot wield a free hand to supervise individual members if it must destroy the Board in order to fix it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even if Commission power over Board activities could substitute for authority over its members, we would still reject respondents\xe2\x80\x99 premise that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s power in this regard is plenary.  As described above, the Board is empowered to take significant enforcement actions, and does so largely independently of the Commission.  See<em> supra,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  Its powers are, of course, subject to some latent Commission control.  See<em> supra,</em> at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  But the Act nowhere gives the Commission effective power to start, stop, or alter individual Board investigations, executive activities typically carried out by officials within the Executive Branch.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Government and the dissent suggest that the Commission could govern and direct the Board\xe2\x80\x99s daily exercise of prosecutorial discretion by promulgating new SEC rules, or by amending those of the Board.  Brief for United States 27; <em>post,</em> at 15.  Enacting general rules through the required notice and comment procedures is obviously a poor means of micromanaging the Board\xe2\x80\x99s affairs.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa778s(c), 7215(b)(1), 7217(b)(5); cf. 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7553, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77202(a), PCAOB Brief 24, n.\xc2\xa06.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  So the Government offers another proposal, that the Commission require the Board by rule to \xe2\x80\x9csecure SEC approval for any actions that it now may take itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 27.  That would surely constitute one of the \xe2\x80\x9climitations upon the activities, functions, and operations of the Board\xe2\x80\x9d that the Act forbids, at least without Commission findings equivalent to those required to fire the Board instead.  \xc2\xa77217(d)(2).  The Board thus has significant independence in determining its priorities and intervening in the affairs of regulated firms (and the lives of their associated persons) without Commission preapproval or direction.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, respondents suggest that our conclusion is contradicted by the past practice of Congress.  But the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is highly unusual in committing substantial executive authority to officers protected by two layers of for-cause removal\xe2\x80\x94including at one level a sharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9cgood cause,\xe2\x80\x9d and rigorous procedures that must be followed prior to removal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The parties have identified only a handful of isolated positions in which inferior officers might be protected by two levels of good-cause tenure.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> PCAOB Brief 43.  As Judge Kavanaugh noted in dissent below:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with the PCAOB is the lack of historical precedent for this entity.  Neither the majority opinion nor the PCAOB nor the United States as intervenor has located any historical analogues for this novel structure.  They have not identified any independent agency other than the PCAOB that is appointed by and removable only for cause by another independent agency.\xe2\x80\x9d  537 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 669.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent here suggests that other such positions might exist, and complains that we do not resolve their status in this opinion.  <em>Post,</em> at 23\xe2\x80\x9331.  The dissent itself, however, stresses the very size and variety of the Federal Government, see <em>post,</em> at 7\xe2\x80\x938, and those features discourage general pronouncements on matters neither briefed nor argued here.  In any event, the dissent fails to support its premonitions of doom; none of the positions it identifies are similarly situated to the Board.  See <em>post,</em> at 28\xe2\x80\x9331.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For example, many civil servants within independent agencies would not qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d who \xe2\x80\x9cexercis[e] significant authority pursuant to the laws of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 126.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  The parties here concede that Board members are executive \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers,\xe2\x80\x9d as that term is used in the Constitution.  See<em> supra,</em> at 4; see also Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02.  We do not decide the status of other Government employees, nor do we decide whether \xe2\x80\x9clesser functionaries subordinate to officers of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d must be subject to the same sort of control as those who exercise \xe2\x80\x9csignificant authority pursuant to the laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 126, and n.\xc2\xa0162.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do the employees referenced by the dissent enjoy the same significant and unusual protections from Presidential oversight as members of the Board.  Senior or policymaking positions in government may be excepted from the competitive service to ensure Presidential control, see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72302(a)(2)(B), 3302, 7511(b)(2), and members of the Senior Executive Service may be reassigned or reviewed by agency heads (and entire agencies may be excluded from that Service by the President), see, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73132(c), 3395(a), 4312(d), 4314(b)(3), (c)(3); cf. \xc2\xa72302(a)(2)(B)(ii).  While the full extent of that authority is not before us, any such authority is of course wholly absent with respect to the Board.  Nothing in our opinion, therefore, should be read to cast doubt on the use of what is colloquially known as the civil service system within independent agencies.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the dissent wanders far afield when it suggests that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion might increase the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to remove military officers.  Without expressing any view whatever on the scope of that authority, it is enough to note that we see little analogy between our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s armed services and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board.  Military officers are broadly subject to Presidential control through the chain of command and through the President\xe2\x80\x99s powers as Commander in Chief.  Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01; see, <em>e.g.,</em> 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7162, 164(g).  The President and his subordinates may also convene boards of inquiry or courts-martial to hear claims of misconduct or poor performance by those officers.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7822(a)(1), 823(a)(1), 892(3), 933\xe2\x80\x93934, 1181\xe2\x80\x931185.  Here, by contrast, the President has no authority to initiate a Board member\xe2\x80\x99s removal for cause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no reason for us to address whether these positions identified by the dissent, or any others not at issue in this case, are so structured as to infringe the President\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional authority.  Nor is there any substance to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s concern that the \xe2\x80\x9cwork of all these various officials\xe2\x80\x9d will \xe2\x80\x9cbe put on hold.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post,</em> at 31.  As the judgment in this case demonstrates, restricting certain officers to a single level of insulation from the President affects the conditions under which those officers might some day be removed, and would have no effect, absent a congressional determination to the contrary, on the validity of any officer\xe2\x80\x99s continuance in office.  The only issue in this case is whether Congress may deprive the President of adequate control over the Board, which is the regulator of first resort and the primary law enforcement authority for a vital sector of our economy.  We hold that it cannot.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 complaint argued that the Board\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfreedom from Presidential oversight and control\xe2\x80\x9d rendered it \xe2\x80\x9cand all power and authority exercised by it\xe2\x80\x9d in violation of the Constitution.  App. 46.  We reject such a broad holding.  Instead, we agree with the Government that the unconstitutional tenure provisions are severable from the remainder of the statute.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cGenerally speaking, when confronting a constitutional flaw in a statute, we try to limit the solution to the problem,\xe2\x80\x9d severing any \xe2\x80\x9cproblematic portions while leaving the remainder intact.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ayotte</em> v. <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/320/index.html">546 U. S. 320</a>, 328\xe2\x80\x93329 (2006).  Because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he unconstitutionality of a part of an Act does not necessarily defeat or affect the validity of its remaining provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Champlin Refining Co.</em> v. <em>Corporation Comm\xe2\x80\x99n of Okla.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/286/210/index.html">286 U. S. 210</a>, 234 (1932), the \xe2\x80\x9cnormal rule\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cthat partial, rather than facial, invalidation is the required course,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Brockett</em> v. <em>Spokane Arcades, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/472/491/index.html">472 U. S. 491</a>, 504 (1985).  Putting to one side petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 Appointments Clause challenges (addressed below), the existence of the Board does not violate the separation of powers, but the substantive removal restrictions imposed by \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77211(e)(6) and 7217(d)(3) do.  Under the traditional default rule, removal is incident to the power of appointment.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Sampson</em> v. <em>Murray</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/61/index.html">415 U. S. 61</a>, 70, n.\xc2\xa017 (1974); <em>Myers</em>, 272 U. S., at 119; <em>Ex parte Hennen</em>, 13 Pet., at 259\xe2\x80\x93260.  Concluding that the removal restrictions are invalid leaves the Board removable by the Commission at will, and leaves the President separated from Board members by only a single level of good-cause tenure.  The Commission is then fully responsible for the Board\xe2\x80\x99s actions, which are no less subject than the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s own functions to Presidential oversight.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Sarbanes-Oxley Act remains \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fully operative as a law\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with these tenure restrictions excised.  <em>New York</em>, 505 U. S., at 186 (quoting <em>Alaska Airlines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Brock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/678/index.html">480 U. S. 678</a>, 684 (1987)).  We therefore must sustain its remaining provisions \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nless it is evident that the Legislature would not have enacted those provisions \xe2\x80\xa6 independently of that which is [invalid].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (internal quotation marks omitted).  Though this inquiry can sometimes be \xe2\x80\x9celusive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Chadha</em>, 462 U. S., at 932, the answer here seems clear: The remaining provisions are not \xe2\x80\x9cincapable of functioning independently,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alaska Airlines</em>,<em> </em>480 U. S., at 684, and nothing in the statute\xe2\x80\x99s text or historical context makes it \xe2\x80\x9cevident\xe2\x80\x9d that Congress, faced with the limitations imposed by the Constitution, would have preferred no Board at all to a Board whose members are removable at will.  <em>Ibid.</em>; see also <em>Ayotte</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 330.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that the language providing for good-cause removal is only one of a number of statutory provisions that, working together, produce a constitutional violation.  In theory, perhaps, the Court might blue-pencil a sufficient number of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s responsibilities so that its members would no longer be \xe2\x80\x9cOfficers of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Or we could restrict the Board\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement powers, so that it would be a purely recommendatory panel.  Or the Board members could in future be made removable by the President, for good cause or at will.  But such editorial freedom\xe2\x80\x94far more extensive than our holding today\xe2\x80\x94belongs to the Legislature, not the Judiciary.  Congress of course remains free to pursue any of these options going forward.</p>\n<p align="left">V</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners raise three more challenges to the Board under the Appointments Clause.  None has merit.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0First, petitioners argue that Board members are principal officers requiring Presidential appointment with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s advice and consent.  We held in <em>Edmond</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/651/index.html">520 U. S. 651</a>, 662\xe2\x80\x93663 (1997), that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hether one is an \xe2\x80\x98inferior\xe2\x80\x99 officer depends on whether he has a superior,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98inferior officers\xe2\x80\x99 are officers whose work is directed and supervised at some level\xe2\x80\x9d by other officers appointed by the President with the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  In particular, we noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he power to remove officers\xe2\x80\x9d at will and without cause \xe2\x80\x9cis a powerful tool for control\xe2\x80\x9d of an inferior.  <em>Id.,</em> at 664.  As explained above, the statutory restrictions on the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s power to remove Board members are unconstitutional and void.  Given that the Commission is properly viewed, under the Constitution, as possessing the power to remove Board members at will, and given the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s other oversight authority, we have no hesitation in concluding that under <em>Edmond</em> the Board members are inferior officers whose appointment Congress may permissibly vest in a \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d] of Departmen[t].\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But, petitioners argue, the Commission is not a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d like the \xe2\x80\x9cExecutive departments\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>e.g.,</em> State, Treasury, Defense) listed in 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7101.  In <em>Freytag</em>, 501 U. S., at 887, n. 4, we specifically reserved the question whether a \xe2\x80\x9cprincipal agenc[y], such as \xe2\x80\xa6 the Securities and Exchange Commission,\xe2\x80\x9d is a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d under the Appointments Clause.  Four Justices, however, would have concluded that the Commission is indeed such a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t],\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>id.,</em> at 918 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), because it is a \xe2\x80\x9cfree-standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 915.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents urge us to adopt this reasoning as to those entities not addressed by our opinion in <em>Freytag</em>, see Brief for United States 37\xe2\x80\x9339; PCAOB Brief 30\xe2\x80\x9333, and we do.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 reading of the Appointments Clause is consistent with the common, near-contemporary definition of a \xe2\x80\x9cdepartment\xe2\x80\x9d as a \xe2\x80\x9cseparate allotment or part of business; a distinct province, in which a class of duties are allotted to a particular person.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 N. Webster, American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (def. 2) (1995 facsimile ed.).  It is also consistent with the early practice of Congress, which in 1792 authorized the Postmaster General to appoint \xe2\x80\x9can assistant, and deputy postmasters, at all places where such shall be found necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73, 1 Stat. 234\xe2\x80\x94thus treating him as the \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d] of [a] Departmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d without the title of Secretary or any role in the President\xe2\x80\x99s Cabinet.  And it is consistent with our prior cases, which have never invalidated an appointment made by the head of such an establishment.  See <em>Freytag</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 917; cf. <em>Burnap</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/252/512/index.html">252 U. S. 512</a>, 515 (1920); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Germaine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/99/508/index.html"></a><a href="/us/99/508/index.html">99 U. S. 508</a>, 511 (1879).  Because the Commission is a freestanding component of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component, it constitutes a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d for the purposes of the Appointments Clause.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But petitioners are not done yet.  They argue that the full Commission cannot constitutionally appoint Board members, because only the Chairman of the Commission is the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d].\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  The Commission\xe2\x80\x99s powers, however, are generally vested in the Commissioners jointly, not the Chairman alone.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa777s, 77t, 78u, 78w.  The Commissioners do not report to the Chairman, who exercises administrative and executive functions subject to the full Commission\xe2\x80\x99s policies.  See Reorg. Plan No. 10 of 1950, \xc2\xa71(b)(1), 64 Stat. 1265.  The Chairman is also appointed from among the Commissioners by the President alone, <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa73, at 1266, which means that he cannot be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9cthe head of an agency\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Reorganization Act.  See 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7904.  (The Commission as a whole, on the other hand, does meet the requirements of the Act, including its provision that \xe2\x80\x9cthe head of an agency [may] be an individual or a commission or board with more than one member.\xe2\x80\x9d)[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As a constitutional matter, we see no reason why a multimember body may not be the \xe2\x80\x9cHea[d]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9cDepartmen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d that it governs.  The Appointments Clause necessarily contemplates collective appointments by the \xe2\x80\x9cCourts of Law,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa02, and each House of Congress, too, appoints its officers collectively, see Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa05; <em>id.,</em> \xc2\xa73, cl.\xc2\xa05.  Petitioners argue that the Framers vested the nomination of principal officers in the President to avoid the perceived evils of collective appointments, but they reveal no similar concern with respect to inferior officers, whose appointments may be vested elsewhere, including in multimember bodies.  Practice has also sanctioned the appointment of inferior officers by multimember agencies.  See <em>Freytag</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 918 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment); see also Classification Act of 1923, ch. 265, \xc2\xa72, 42 Stat. 1488 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cthe head of the department\xe2\x80\x9d to mean \xe2\x80\x9cthe officer <em>or group of officers</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 who are not subordinate or responsible to any other officer of the department\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); 37 Op. Atty. Gen. 227, 231 (1933) (endorsing collective appointment by the Civil Service Commission).  We conclude that the Board members have been validly appointed by the full Commission.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the foregoing, petitioners are not entitled to broad injunctive relief against the Board\xe2\x80\x99s continued operations.  But they are entitled to declaratory relief sufficient to ensure that the reporting requirements and auditing standards to which they are subject will be enforced only by a constitutional agency accountable to the Executive.  See <em>Bowsher</em>, 478 U.

It violates no separation-of-powers principle.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s contrary holding threatens to disrupt severely the fair and efficient administration of the laws.  I consequently dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The legal question before us arises at the intersection of two general constitutional principles.  On the one hand, Congress has broad power to enact statutes \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary and proper\xe2\x80\x9d to the exercise of its specifically enumerated constitutional authority.  Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa78, cl. 18.  As Chief Justice Marshall wrote for the Court nearly 200 years ago, the Necessary and Proper Clause reflects the Framers\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to create a Constitution that would \xe2\x80\x9cendure for ages to come.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCulloch</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, 4 Wheat. 316, 415 (1819).  It embodies their recognition that it would be \xe2\x80\x9cunwise\xe2\x80\x9d to prescribe \xe2\x80\x9cthe means by which government should, in all future time, execute its powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Such \xe2\x80\x9cimmutable rules\xe2\x80\x9d would deprive the Government of the needed flexibility to respond to future \xe2\x80\x9cexigencies which, if foreseen at all, must have been seen dimly.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Thus the Necessary and Proper Clause affords Congress broad authority to \xe2\x80\x9ccreate\xe2\x80\x9d governmental \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98offices\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and to structure those offices \xe2\x80\x9cas it chooses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Buckley</em> v. <em>Valeo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/424/1/index.html">424 U. S. 1</a>, 138 (1976) <em>(per curiam);</em> cf. <em>Lottery Case</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/188/321/index.html">188 U. S. 321</a>, 355 (1903).  And Congress has drawn on that power over the past century to create numerous federal agencies in response to \xe2\x80\x9cvarious crises of human affairs\xe2\x80\x9d as they have arisen.  <em>McCulloch, supra,</em> at 415 (emphasis deleted).  Cf. <em>Wong Yang Sung</em> v. <em>McGrath</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/339/33/index.html">339 U. S. 33</a>, 36\xe2\x80\x9337 (1950).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, the opening sections of Articles I, II, and III of the Constitution separately and respectively vest \xe2\x80\x9call legislative Powers\xe2\x80\x9d in Congress, the \xe2\x80\x9cexecutive Power\xe2\x80\x9d in the President, and the \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial Power\xe2\x80\x9d in the Supreme Court (and such \xe2\x80\x9cinferior Courts as Congress may from time to time ordain and establish\xe2\x80\x9d).  In doing so, these provisions imply a structural separation-of-powers principle.  See, <em>e.g</em>., <em>Miller</em> v. <em>French</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/327/index.html">530 U. S. 327</a>, 341\xe2\x80\x93342 (2000).  And that principle, along with the instruction in Article II, \xc2\xa73 that the President \xe2\x80\x9cshall take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed,\xe2\x80\x9d limits Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power to structure the Federal Government.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>INS</em> v. <em>Chadha</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/462/919/index.html">462 U. S. 919</a>, 946 (1983); <em>Freytag</em> v. <em>Commissioner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/868/index.html">501 U. S. 868</a>, 878 (1991); <em>Northern Pipeline Constr.

Indeed, this Court has held that the separation-of-powers principle guarantees the President the authority to dismiss certain Executive Branch officials at will.  <em>Myers</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/52/index.html">272 U. S. 52</a> (1926).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But neither of these two principles is absolute in its application to removal cases.  The Necessary and Proper Clause does not grant Congress power to free <em>all</em> Executive Branch officials from dismissal at the will of the President.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Nor does the separation-of-powers principle grant the President an absolute authority to remove <em>any and all</em> Executive Branch officials at will.  Rather, depending on, say, the nature of the office, its function, or its subject matter, Congress sometimes may, consistent with the Constitution, limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to remove an officer from his post.  See <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/295/602/index.html"></a><a href="/us/295/602/index.html">295 U.

And we must here decide whether the circumstances surrounding the statute at issue justify such a limitation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In answering the question presented, we cannot look to more specific constitutional text, such as the text of the Appointments Clause or the Presentment Clause, upon which the Court has relied in other separation-of-powers cases.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chadha, supra,</em> at 946; <em>Buckley, supra, </em>at 124\xe2\x80\x93125.  That is because, with the exception of the general \xe2\x80\x9cvesting\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctake care\xe2\x80\x9d language, the Constitution is completely \xe2\x80\x9csilent with respect to the power of removal from office.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ex parte Hennen</em>, 13 Pet. 230, 258 (1839); see also <em>Morrison</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 723 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThere is, of course, no provision in the Constitution stating who may remove executive officers \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does history offer significant help.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s power to remove Executive Branch officers \xe2\x80\x9cwas not discussed in the Constitutional Convention.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Myers, supra,</em> at 109\xe2\x80\x93110.  The First Congress enacted federal statutes that limited the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to <em>oversee</em> Executive Branch officials, including the Comptroller of the United States, federal district attorneys (precursors to today\xe2\x80\x99s United States Attorneys), and, to a lesser extent, the Secretary of the Treasury.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> Lessig, Readings By Our Unitary Executive, 15 Cardozo L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 175, 183\xe2\x80\x93184 (1993); Teifer, The Constitutionality of Independent Officers as Checks on Abuses of Executive Power, 63 B.\xc2\xa0U.

Fisher, President and Congress: Power and Policy 86\xe2\x80\x9389 (1972).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent fully answer the question presented.  At least it does not clearly invalidate the provision in dispute.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>infra</em>.  In <em>Myers, supra, </em>the Court invalidated\xe2\x80\x94for the first and only time\xe2\x80\x94a congressional statute on the ground that it unduly limited the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to remove an Executive Branch official.  But soon thereafter the Court expressly disapproved most of <em>Myers\xe2\x80\x99 </em>broad reasoning.  See <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em>, 295 U. S., at 626\xe2\x80\x93627, overruling in part <em>Myers, supra</em>; <em>Wiener</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/357/349/index.html"></a><a href="/us/357/349/index.html">357 U. S. 349</a>, 352 (1958) (stating that <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor </em>\xe2\x80\x9cexplicitly \xe2\x80\x98disapproved\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of much of the reasoning in <em>Myers</em>).  Moreover, the Court has since said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe essence of the decision in <em>Myers</em> was the judgment that the Constitution prevents Congress from <em>\xe2\x80\x98draw[ing] to itself</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 the power to remove or the right to participate in the exercise of that power.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morrison</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 686 (emphasis added).  And that feature of the statute\xe2\x80\x94a feature that would <em>aggrandize </em>the power of Congress\xe2\x80\x94is not present here.  Congress has not granted itself any role in removing the members of the Accounting Board.  Cf. <em>Freytag, </em>501 U. S.,<em> </em>at 878 (\xe2\x80\x9cseparation-of-powers jurisprudence generally focuses on the danger of one branch\xe2\x80\x99s <em>aggrandizing its power</em> at the expense of another branch\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>Buckley, </em>424 U. S., at 129 (same); <em>Schor, </em>478 U. S., at 856 (same); <em>Bowsher</em> v. <em>Synar</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/714/index.html">478 U. S. 714</a>, 727 (1986) (same).  Compare <em>Myers, supra,</em> (striking down statute where Congress granted <em>itself</em> removal authority over Executive Branch official), with <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor, supra, </em>(upholding statute where such aggrandizing was absent)<em>; Wiener, supra</em> (same)<em>; Morrison, supra </em>(same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the question presented lies at the intersection of two sets of conflicting, broadly framed constitutional principles.  And no text, no history, perhaps no precedent provides any clear answer.  Cf. <em>Chicago</em> v. <em>Morales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/41/index.html">527 U. S. 41</a>, 106 (1999) (Thomas, J., joined by Rehnquist, C.\xc2\xa0J., and Scalia, J., dissenting) (expressing the view that \xe2\x80\x9cthis Court\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cmost vulnerable\xe2\x80\x9d when \xe2\x80\x9cit deals with judge-made constitutional law\xe2\x80\x9d that lacks \xe2\x80\x9croots in the language\xe2\x80\x9d of the Constitution (internal quotation marks omitted)).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When previously deciding this kind of nontextual question, the Court has emphasized the importance of examining how a particular provision, taken in context, is likely to function.  Thus, in <em>Crowell </em>v. <em>Benson, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/22/index.html">285 U. S. 22</a>, 53 (1932), a foundational separation-of-powers case, the Court said that \xe2\x80\x9cregard must be had, as in other cases where constitutional limits are invoked, not to mere matters of form, but to the substance of what is required.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court repeated this injunction in <em>Schor </em>and again in <em>Morrison.</em>  See <em>Schor, supra, at </em>854 (stating that the Court must look \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98beyond form to the substance of what\xe2\x80\x99 Congress has done\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Morrison, </em>487 U. S., at 689\xe2\x80\x93690 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe analysis contained in our removal cases is designed <em>not to define rigid categories</em> of those officials who may or may not be removed at will by the President,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather asks whether, given the \xe2\x80\x9cfunctions of the officials in question,\xe2\x80\x9d a removal provision \xe2\x80\x9cinterfere[s] with the President\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of the \xe2\x80\x98executive power\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The Court has thereby written into law<em> </em>Justice Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s wise perception that \xe2\x80\x9cthe Constitution \xe2\x80\xa6 contemplates that practice will integrate the dispersed powers into<em> a workable government.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co.</em> v. <em>Sawyer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/343/579/index.html"></a><a href="/us/343/579/index.html">343 U. S. 579</a>, 635 (1952) (opinion concurring in judgment) (emphasis added).  See also <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThe actual art of governing under our Constitution does not and cannot conform to judicial definitions of the power of any of its branches based on isolated clauses or even single Articles torn from context\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is not surprising that the Court in these circumstances has looked to function and context, and not to bright-line rules.  For one thing, that approach embodies the intent of the Framers.  As Chief Justice Marshall long ago observed, our Constitution is fashioned so as to allow the three coordinate branches, including this Court, to exercise practical judgment in response to changing conditions and \xe2\x80\x9cexigencies,\xe2\x80\x9d which at the time of the founding could be seen only \xe2\x80\x9cdimly,\xe2\x80\x9d and perhaps not at all.  <em>McCulloch, </em>4 Wheat., at 415.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another, a functional approach permits Congress and the President the flexibility needed to adapt statutory law to changing circumstances.  That is why the \xe2\x80\x9cpowers conferred upon the Federal Government by the Constitution were phrased in language broad enough to allow for the expansion of the Federal Government\xe2\x80\x99s role\xe2\x80\x9d over time.  <em>New York</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/144/index.html">505 U. S. 144</a>, 157 (1992).  Indeed, the Federal Government at the time of the founding consisted of about 2,000 employees and served a population of about 4 million.  See Kaufman, The Growth of the Federal Personnel System, in The Federal Government Service 7, 8 (W.\xc2\xa0Sayre 2d ed. 1965); Dept. of Commerce, Census Bureau, Historical Statistics of the United States: Colonial Times to 1970, pt. 1, p. 8 (1975).  Today, however, the Federal Government employs about <em>4.4 million workers</em> who serve a Nation of more than 310 million people living in a society characterized by rapid technological, economic, and social change.  See Office of Management and Budget, Analytical Perspectives, Budget of the U. S. Government, Fiscal Year 2010, p.\xc2\xa0368 (2009).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Federal statutes now require or permit Government officials to provide, regulate, or otherwise administer, not only foreign affairs and defense, but also a wide variety of such subjects as taxes, welfare, social security, medicine, pharmaceutical drugs, education, highways, railroads, electricity, natural gas, nuclear power, financial instruments, banking, medical care, public health and safety, the environment, fair employment practices, consumer protection and much else besides.  Those statutes create a host of different organizational structures. Sometimes they delegate administrative authority to the President directly, <em>e.g., </em>10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72031(a)(1); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75192(c); sometimes they place authority in a long-established Cabinet department, <em>e.g., </em>7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71637b(c)(1); 12 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa75221(b)(2) (2006 ed., Supp. II); sometimes they delegate authority to an independent commission or board, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74404(b); 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7994; sometimes they place authority directly in the hands of a single senior administrator, <em>e.g.,</em> 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7657d(c)(4); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7421; sometimes they place it in a sub-cabinet bureau, office, division or other agency, <em>e.g., </em>18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa74048; sometimes they vest it in multimember or multiagency task groups, <em>e.g. </em>5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7593\xe2\x80\x93594; 50 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7402 (2006 ed. and Supp. II); sometimes they vest it in commissions or advisory committees made up of members of more than one branch, <em>e.g., </em>20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa742(a); 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7991(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71975; sometimes they divide it among groups of departments, commissions, bureaus, divisions, and administrators, <em>e.g.,</em> 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa79902(a) (2006 ed., Supp. II); 7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7136i\xe2\x80\x931(g); and sometimes they permit state or local governments to participate as well, <em>e.g., </em>7 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72009aa\xe2\x80\x931(a).  Statutes similarly grant administrators a wide variety of powers\xe2\x80\x94for example, the power to make rules, develop informal practices, investigate, adjudicate, impose sanctions, grant licenses, and provide goods, services, advice, and so forth.  See generally 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7500 <em>et seq.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that today vast numbers of statutes governing vast numbers of subjects, concerned with vast numbers of different problems, provide for, or foresee, their execution or administration through the work of administrators organized within many different kinds of administrative structures, exercising different kinds of administrative authority, to achieve their legislatively mandated objectives.  And, given the nature of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s work, it is not surprising that administrative units come in many different shapes and sizes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The functional approach required by our precedents recognizes this administrative complexity and, more importantly, recognizes the various ways presidential power operates within this context\xe2\x80\x94and the various ways in which a removal provision might affect that power.  As human beings have known ever since Ulysses tied himself to the mast so as safely to hear the Sirens\xe2\x80\x99 song, sometimes it is necessary to disable oneself in order to achieve a broader objective.  Thus, legally enforceable commitments\xe2\x80\x94such as contracts, statutes that cannot instantly be changed, and, as in the case before us, the establishment of independent administrative institutions\xe2\x80\x94hold the potential to empower precisely because of their ability to constrain.  If the President seeks to regulate through impartial adjudication, then insulation of the adjudicator from removal at will can help him achieve that goal.  And to free a technical decisionmaker from the fear of removal without cause can similarly help create legitimacy with respect to that official\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory actions by helping to insulate his technical decisions from nontechnical political pressure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither is power always susceptible to the equations of elementary arithmetic.  A rule that takes power from a President\xe2\x80\x99s friends and allies may weaken him.  But a rule that takes power from the President\xe2\x80\x99s opponents may strengthen him.  And what if the rule takes power from a functionally <em>neutral</em> independent authority?  In that case, it is difficult to predict how the President\xe2\x80\x99s power is affected in the abstract.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These practical reasons not only support our precedents\xe2\x80\x99 determination that cases such as this should examine the specific functions and context at issue; they also indicate that judges should hesitate before second-guessing a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d decision made by the other branches.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Chadha</em>, 462 U. S., at 944 (applying a \xe2\x80\x9cpresumption that the challenged statute is valid\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Bowsher</em>, 478 U. S., at 736 (Stevens, J., concurring in judgment).  Compared to Congress and the President, the Judiciary possesses an inferior understanding of the realities of administration, and the manner in which power, including and most especially political power, operates in context.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no indication that the two comparatively more expert branches were divided in their support for the \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision at issue here.  In this case, the Act embodying the provision was passed by a vote of 423 to 3 in the House of Representatives and a by vote of 99 to 0 in the Senate.  148 Cong. Rec. 14458, 14505 (2002).  The creation of the Accounting Board was discussed at great length in both bodies without anyone finding in its structure any constitutional problem.  See <em>id.,</em> at 12035\xe2\x80\x9312037, 12112\xe2\x80\x9312132, 12315\xe2\x80\x9312323, 12372\xe2\x80\x9312377, 12488\xe2\x80\x9312508, 12529\xe2\x80\x9312534, 12612\xe2\x80\x9312618, 12673\xe2\x80\x9312680, 12734\xe2\x80\x9312751, 12915\xe2\x80\x9312960, 13347\xe2\x80\x9313354, 14439\xe2\x80\x9314458, 14487\xe2\x80\x9314506.  The President signed the Act.  And, when he did so, he issued a signing statement that critiqued multiple provisions of the Act but did not express any separation-of-powers concerns.  See President\xe2\x80\x99s Statement on Signing the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 30 Weekly Comp. of Pres. Doc. 1286 (2002).  Cf. ABA, Report of Task Force on Presidential Signing Statements and the Separation of Powers Doctrine 15 (2006), online at http://www.signingstatementsaba_final_signing_\nstatements_recommendations-report_7-24-06.pdf (all Inter-\nnet materials as visited June 24, 2010, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (noting that President Bush asserted \xe2\x80\x9cover 500\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional objections\xe2\x80\x9d through signing statements \xe2\x80\x9cin his first term,\xe2\x80\x9d including 82 \xe2\x80\x9crelated to his theory of the \xe2\x80\x98unitary executive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, here, as in similar cases, we should decide the constitutional question in light of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s practical functioning in context.  And our decision should take account of the Judiciary\xe2\x80\x99s comparative lack of institutional expertise.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To what extent then is the Act\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision likely, as a practical matter, to limit the President\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of executive authority?  In practical terms no \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision can, in isolation, define the full measure of executive power.  This is because a legislative decision to place ultimate administrative authority in, say, the Secretary of Agriculture rather than the President, the way in which the statute defines the scope of the power the relevant administrator can exercise, the decision as to who controls the agency\xe2\x80\x99s budget requests and funding, the relationships between one agency or department and another, as well as more purely  political factors (including Congress\xe2\x80\x99 ability to assert influence) are more likely to affect the President\xe2\x80\x99s power to get something done.  That is why President Truman complained that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the powers of the President amount to\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d bringing \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98people in and try[ing] to persuade them to do what they ought to do without persuasion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Rossiter, The American Presidency 154 (2d rev. ed. 1960).  And that is why scholars have written that the President \xe2\x80\x9cis neither dominant nor powerless\xe2\x80\x9d in his relationships with many Government entities, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether denominated executive or independent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Strauss, The Place of Agencies in Government: Separation of Powers and the Fourth Branch, 84 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 573, 583 (1984) (hereinafter Strauss).  Those entities \xe2\x80\x9care <em>all</em> subject to presidential direction in significant aspects of their functioning, and [are each] able to resist presidential direction in others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, notwithstanding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that the removal authority is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the</em> key\xe2\x80\x9d mechanism by which the President oversees inferior officers in the independent agencies, <em>ante, </em>at 20, it appears that no President has ever actually sought to exercise that power by testing the scope of a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision.  See Bruff, Bringing the Independent Agencies in from the Cold, 62 Vanderbilt L.\xc2\xa0Rev. En Banc 63, 68 (2009), online at http://vanderbiltlawreview.\norg/articles/2009/11/Bruff-62-Vand-L-Rev-En-Banc-63.pdf (noting that \xe2\x80\x9cPresidents do not test the limits of their power by removing commissioners \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); Lessig &amp; Sunstein 110\xe2\x80\x93112 (noting that courts have not had occasion to define what constitutes \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d because Presidents rarely test removal provisions).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if we put all these other matters to the side, we should still conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d restriction before us will not restrict presidential power significantly.  For one thing, the restriction directly limits, not the President\xe2\x80\x99s power, but the power of an already independent agency.  The Court seems to have forgotten that fact when it identifies its central constitutional problem: According to the Court, the President \xe2\x80\x9cis powerless to intervene\xe2\x80\x9d if he has determined that the Board members\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cconduct merit[s] removal\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat decision is vested instead in other tenured officers\xe2\x80\x94the Commissioners\xe2\x80\x94none of whom is subject to the President\xe2\x80\x99s direct control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  But so long as the President is <em>legitimately</em> foreclosed from removing the <em>Commissioners</em> except for cause (as the majority assumes), nullifying the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s power to remove Board members only for cause will not resolve the problem the Court has identified: The President will <em>still </em>be \xe2\x80\x9cpowerless to intervene\xe2\x80\x9d by removing the Board members if the Commission reasonably decides not to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In other words, the Court fails to show why <em>two</em> layers of \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protection\xe2\x80\x94Layer One insulating the Commissioners from the President, and Layer Two insulating the Board from the Commissioners\xe2\x80\x94impose any more serious limitation upon the <em>President\xe2\x80\x99s</em> powers than <em>one </em>layer.  Consider the four scenarios that might arise:</p>\n<p>\n<left>1.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President and the Commission both want to keep a Board member in office.  Neither layer is relevant.</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>2.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President and the Commission both want to dismiss a Board member<em>.</em>  Layer Two stops them both from doing so without cause.  The President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to remove the Commission (Layer One) is irrelevant, for he and the Commission are in agreement.</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>3.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President wants to dismiss a Board member, but the Commission wants to keep the member.  Layer One allows the Commission to make that determination notwithstanding the President\xe2\x80\x99s contrary view.  Layer Two is irrelevant because the Commission does not seek to remove the Board member.</left></p>\n<p>\n<left>4.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The President wants to keep a Board member, but the Commission wants to dismiss the Board member.  Here, Layer Two <em>helps</em> <em>the President,</em> for it hinders the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s ability to dismiss a Board member whom the President wants to keep in place.</left></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s decision to eliminate only <em>Layer Two</em> accomplishes virtually nothing.  And that is because a removal restriction\xe2\x80\x99s effect upon presidential power depends not on the presence of a \xe2\x80\x9cdouble-layer\xe2\x80\x9d of for-cause removal, as the majority pretends, but rather on the real-world nature of the President\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the Commission.  If the President confronts a Commission that seeks to <em>resist</em> his policy preferences\xe2\x80\x94a distinct possibility when, as here, a Commission\xe2\x80\x99s membership must reflect both political parties, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d(a)\xe2\x80\x94the restriction on the <em>Commission\xe2\x80\x99s </em>ability to remove a Board member is either irrelevant (as in scenario 3) or may actually help the President (as in scenario 4).  And if the President faces a Commission that seeks to <em>implement</em> his policy preferences, Layer One is irrelevant, for the President and Commission see eye to eye.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In order to avoid this elementary logic, the Court creates two alternative scenarios.  In the first,  the Commission and the President <em>both</em> want to remove a Board member, but have varying judgments as to whether they have good \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to do so\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e., </em>the President and the Commission both conclude that a Board member should be removed, but disagree as to whether that conclusion (which they have both reached) is <em>reasonable</em>.  <em>Ante, </em>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.  In the second, the President wants to remove a Board member and the Commission disagrees; but, notwithstanding its freedom to make reasonable decisions independent of the President (afforded by Layer One), the Commission (while apparently telling the President that it agrees with him and would like to remove the Board member) uses Layer Two as an \xe2\x80\x9cexcuse\xe2\x80\x9d to pursue its actual aims\xe2\x80\x94an excuse which, given Layer One, it does not need.  <em>Ante,</em> at 15, n.\xc2\xa04.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Both of these circumstances seem unusual.  I do not know if they have ever occurred.  But I do not deny their logical possibility.  I simply doubt their importance.  And the fact that, with respect to the President\xe2\x80\x99s power, the double layer of for-cause removal sometimes might help, sometimes might hurt, leads me to conclude that its overall effect is at most indeterminate.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But once we leave the realm of hypothetical logic and view the removal provision at issue in the context of the entire Act, its lack of practical effect becomes readily apparent.  That is because the statute provides the Commission with full authority and virtually comprehensive control over all of the Board\xe2\x80\x99s functions.  Those who created the Accounting Board modeled it, in terms of structure and authority, upon the semiprivate regulatory bodies prevalent in the area of financial regulation, such as the New York Stock Exchange and other similar self-regulating organizations.  See generally Brief for Former Chairmen of the SEC as <em>Amici Curiae </em>(hereinafter Brief for Former SEC Chairmen)<em>.</em>  And those organizations\xe2\x80\x94which rely on private financing and on officers drawn from the private sector\xe2\x80\x94exercise rulemaking and adjudicatory authority that is pervasively controlled by, and is indeed \xe2\x80\x9centirely derivative\xe2\x80\x9d of, the SEC.  See <em>National Assn. of Securities Dealers, Inc. </em>v. <em>SEC,</em> 431 F.\xc2\xa03d 803, 806 (CADC 2005).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Adhering to that model, the statute here gives the Accounting Board the power to adopt rules and standards \xe2\x80\x9crelating to the preparation of audit reports\xe2\x80\x9d; to adjudicate disciplinary proceedings involving accounting firms that fail to follow these rules; to impose sanctions; and to engage in other related activities, such as conducting inspections of accounting firms registered as the law requires and investigations to monitor compliance with the rules and related legal obligations.

On the contrary, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s control over the Board\xe2\x80\x99s investigatory and legal functions is virtually absolute.  Moreover, the Commission has general supervisory powers over the Accounting Board itself: It controls the Board\xe2\x80\x99s budget, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77219(b), (d)(1); it can assign to the Board any \xe2\x80\x9cduties or functions\xe2\x80\x9d that it \xe2\x80\x9cdetermines are necessary or appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77211(c)(5); it has full \xe2\x80\x9coversight and enforcement authority over the Board,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77217(a), <em>including the authority to inspect the Board\xe2\x80\x99s activities whenever it believes it \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate\xe2\x80\x9d to do so, </em>\xc2\xa77217(d)(2) (emphasis added).  And it can censure the Board or its members, as well as remove the members from office, if the members, for example, fail to enforce the Act, violate any provisions of the Act, or abuse the authority granted to them under the Act, \xc2\xa77217(d)(3).

What is the practical likelihood of that occurring, or, if it does, of the President\xe2\x80\x99s serious concern about such a matter?

First and foremost, the Board adjudicates cases.  See 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77215.  This Court has long recognized the appropriateness of using \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provisions to protect the personal independence of those who even only sometimes engage in adjudicatory functions.  <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 623\xe2\x80\x93628; see also <em>Wiener</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 355\xe2\x80\x93356; <em>Morrison, </em>487 U.

The Court, however, all but ignores the Board\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory functions when conducting its analysis.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante, </em>at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  And when it finally does address that central function (in a footnote), it simply asserts that the Board <em>does not \xe2\x80\x9cperform</em> adjudicative \xe2\x80\xa6 functions,\xe2\x80\x9d a<em>nte, </em>at 26, n.\xc2\xa010 (emphasis added), an assertion that is inconsistent with the terms of the statute.  See \xc2\xa77215(c)(1) (governing \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding[s] by the Board to determine whether a registered public accounting firm, or an associated person thereof, should be disciplined\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, in addition to their adjudicative functions, the Accounting Board members supervise, and are themselves, technical professional experts.  See \xc2\xa77211(e)(1) (requiring that Board members \xe2\x80\x9chave a demonstrated\xe2\x80\x9d technical \xe2\x80\x9cunderstanding of the responsibilities\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cobligations of accountants with respect to the preparation and issuance of audit reports\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court has recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cdifficulties involved in the preparation of\xe2\x80\x9d sound auditing reports require the application of \xe2\x80\x9cscientific accounting principles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Anderson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/269/422/index.html">269 U.

See <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 624\xe2\x80\x93626; see also Breger &amp; Edles, Established by Practice: The Theory and Operation of Independent Federal Agencies, 52 Admin.

Congress deliberately sought to provide that kind of protection.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 148 Cong. Rec. 12036, 12115, 13352\xe2\x80\x9313355.  It did so for good reason.  See <em>ante, </em>at 3 (noting that the Accounting Board was created in response to \xe2\x80\x9ca series of celebrated accounting debacles\xe2\x80\x9d); H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep.

And historically, this regulatory subject matter\xe2\x80\x94financial regulation\xe2\x80\x94has been thought to exhibit a particular need for independence.  See <em>e.g., </em>51 Cong. Rec. 8857 (1914) (remarks of Sen. Morgan upon creation of the Federal Trade Commission) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is unsafe for an \xe2\x80\xa6 administrative officer representing a great political party \xe2\x80\xa6 to hold the power of life and death over the great business interests of this country\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. That is \xe2\x80\xa6 why I believe in \xe2\x80\xa6 taking these business matters out of politics\xe2\x80\x9d).  And Congress, by, for example, providing the Board with a revenue stream independent of the congressional appropriations process, \xc2\xa77219, helped insulate the Board from congressional, as well as other, political influences.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 148 Cong. Rec. 12036 (statement of Sen. Stabenow).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, Congress and the President could reasonably have thought it prudent to insulate the adjudicative Board members from fear of purely politically based removal.  Cf. <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Letter Carriers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/index.html">413 U. S. 548</a>, 565 (1973) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not only important that the Government and its employees in fact avoid practicing political justice, but it is also critical that they appear to the public to be avoiding it, if confidence in the system of representative Government is not to be eroded to a disastrous extent\xe2\x80\x9d).  And in a world in which we count on the Federal Government to regulate matters as complex as, say, nuclear-power production, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that we should simply learn to get by \xe2\x80\x9cwithout being\xe2\x80\x9d regulated \xe2\x80\x9cby experts\xe2\x80\x9d is, at best, unrealistic\xe2\x80\x94at worst, dangerously so.  <em>Ante, </em>at 18.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Where a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision is so unlikely to restrict presidential power and so likely to further a legitimate institutional need, precedent strongly supports its constitutionality.  First, in considering a related issue in <em>Nixon</em> v. <em>Administrator of General Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/433/425/index.html">433 U. S. 425</a> (1977),<em> </em>the Court made clear that when \xe2\x80\x9cdetermining whether the Act disrupts the proper balance between the coordinate branches, the proper inquiry focuses on the extent to which it prevents the Executive Branch from accomplishing its constitutionally assigned functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 443.  The Court said the same in <em>Morrison, </em>where it upheld a restriction on the President\xe2\x80\x99s removal power.  487 U. S., at 691 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he real question is whether the removal restrictions are of such a nature that they impede the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to perform his constitutional duty, and the functions of the officials in question must be analyzed in that light\xe2\x80\x9d).  Here, the removal restriction may somewhat diminish the <em>Commission\xe2\x80\x99s</em> ability to control the Board, but it will have little, if any, negative effect in respect to the President\xe2\x80\x99s ability to control the Board, let alone to coordinate the Executive Branch.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>.  Indeed, given <em>Morrison, </em>where the Court upheld a restriction that significantly interfered with the President\xe2\x80\x99s important historic power to control criminal prosecutions, a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98purely executive\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d function, 487 U.

The Accounting Board\xe2\x80\x99s functions involve both kinds of responsibility.  And, accordingly, the Accounting Board\xe2\x80\x99s adjudicatory responsibilities, the technical nature of its job, the need to attract experts to that job, and the importance of demonstrating the nonpolitical nature of the job to the public strongly justify a statute that assures that Board members need not fear for their jobs when competently carrying out their tasks, while still maintaining the Commission as the ultimate authority over Board policies and actions.

It has instead sought to <em>limit</em> its own power, by, for example, providing the Accounting Board with a revenue stream independent of the congressional appropriations process.  See <em>supra, </em>at 19; see also Brief for Former SEC Chairmen 16.  And this case thereby falls outside the ambit of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s most serious constitutional concern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior cases impose functional criteria that are readily met here.  Once one goes beyond the Court\xe2\x80\x99s elementary arithmetical logic (<em>i.e., </em>\xe2\x80\x9cone plus one is greater than one\xe2\x80\x9d) our precedent virtually dictates a holding that the challenged \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision is constitutional.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We should ask one further question.  Even if the \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision before us does not itself significantly interfere with the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority or aggrandize Congress\xe2\x80\x99 power, is it nonetheless necessary to adopt a bright-line rule forbidding the provision lest, through a series of such provisions, each itself upheld as reasonable, Congress might undercut the President\xe2\x80\x99s central constitutional role?  Cf. Strauss 625\xe2\x80\x93626.  The answer to this question is that no such need has been shown.  Moreover, insofar as the Court seeks to create such a rule, it fails.  And in failing it threatens a harm that is far more serious than any imaginable harm this \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision might bring about.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court fails to create a bright-line rule because of considerable uncertainty about the scope of its holding\xe2\x80\x94an uncertainty that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion both reflects and generates.  The Court suggests, for example, that its rule may not apply where an inferior officer \xe2\x80\x9cperform[s] adjudicative \xe2\x80\xa6 functions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 26, n.\xc2\xa010.  But the Accounting Board performs adjudicative functions.  <em>See supra,</em> at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  What, then, are we to make of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s potential exception?  And would such an exception apply to an administrative law judge who also has important administrative duties beyond pure adjudication?  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 8 CFR \xc2\xa71003.9, 34 CFR \xc2\xa781.4 (2009).  The Court elsewhere suggests that its rule may be limited to removal statutes that provide for \xe2\x80\x9cjudicial review of a[n] effort to remove\xe2\x80\x9d an official for cause.  <em>Ante, </em>at 22; <em>ante, </em>at 25.  But we have previously stated that <em>all </em>officers protected by a for-cause removal provision and later subject to termination are entitled to \xe2\x80\x9cnotice and [a] hearing\xe2\x80\x9d in the \xe2\x80\x9ccourts,\xe2\x80\x9d as without such review \xe2\x80\x9cthe appointing power\xe2\x80\x9d otherwise \xe2\x80\x9ccould remove at pleasure or for such cause as [only] it deemed sufficient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Reagan</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/182/419/index.html">182 U. S. 419</a>, 425 (1901); <em>Shurtleff</em>, 189 U. S., at 314; cf. <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor, supra</em> (entertaining civil suit challenging removal).  But cf. <em>Bowsher,</em> <em>supra</em>, at 729.  What weight, then, should be given to this hint of an exception?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court further seems to suggest that its holding may not apply to inferior officers who have a different relationship to their appointing agents than the relationship between the Commission and the Board.  See <em>ante, </em>at 22, 24\xe2\x80\x9326.  But the only characteristic of the \xe2\x80\x9crelationship\xe2\x80\x9d between the Commission and the Board that the Court apparently deems relevant is that the relationship includes two layers of for-cause removal.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>ante, </em>at 23 (\xe2\x80\x9cBroad power over Board functions is not equivalent to the power to remove Board members\xe2\x80\x9d).  Why then would any different relationship that also includes two layers of for-cause removal survive where this one has not?  Cf. Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra </em>(describing the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s near absolute control over the Board).  In a word, what differences are relevant?  If the Court means to state that its holding in fact applies only where Congress has \xe2\x80\x9cenacted an <em>unusually</em> <em>high</em> <em>standard</em>\xe2\x80\x9d of for-cause removal\xe2\x80\x94and does not otherwise render two layers of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ordinary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for-cause removal unconstitutional\xe2\x80\x94I should welcome the statement.  <em>Ante, </em>at 22 (emphasis added); see also <em>ante, </em>at 24\xe2\x80\x9325, 15, 22, (underscoring this statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csharply circumscribed definition of what constitutes \xe2\x80\x98good cause\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and its \xe2\x80\x9crigorous,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9csignificant and unusual [removal] protections\xe2\x80\x9d).  But much of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion appears to avoid so narrow a holding in favor of a broad, basically mechanical rule\xe2\x80\x94a rule that, as I have said, is divorced from the context of the case at hand.  Compare Parts III\xe2\x80\x93A, III\xe2\x80\x93B, III\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>ante</em>, with Parts II\xe2\x80\x93A, II\xe2\x80\x93B, II\xe2\x80\x93C, <em>supra.</em>  And such a mechanical rule cannot be cabined simply by saying that, <em>perhaps, </em>the rule does not apply to instances that, at least at first blush, seem highly similar.  A judicial holding by its very nature is not \xe2\x80\x9ca restricted railroad ticket, good for\xe2\x80\x9d one \xe2\x80\x9cday and train only.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Allwright</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/321/649/index.html">321 U. S. 649</a>, 669 (1944) (Roberts, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court begins to reveal the practical problems inherent in its double for-cause rule when it suggests that its rule may not apply to \xe2\x80\x9cthe civil service.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 26.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccivil service\xe2\x80\x9d is defined by statute to include \xe2\x80\x9call appointive positions in \xe2\x80\xa6 the Government of the United States,\xe2\x80\x9d excluding the military, but including <em>all</em> civil \xe2\x80\x9cofficer[s]\xe2\x80\x9d up to and including those who are subject to Senate confirmation. 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72101, 2102(a)(1)(B), 2104.  The civil service thus includes many officers indistinguishable from the members of both the Commission and the Accounting Board.  Indeed, as this Court recognized in <em>Myers, </em>the \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive service\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the class within the broader civil service that enjoys the most robust career protection\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cincludes a <em>vast majority</em> of all the civil officers\xe2\x80\x9d in the United States.  272 U. S., at 173 (emphasis added); 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72102(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if I assume that the majority categorically excludes the competitive service from the scope of its new rule, cf. <em>ante, </em>at 26 (leaving this question open), the exclusion would be insufficient.  This is because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdouble for-cause\xe2\x80\x9d rule applies to appointees who are \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officer[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 2.  And who are they?  Courts and scholars have struggled for more than a century to define the constitutional term \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officers,\xe2\x80\x9d without much success.  See 2 J. Story, Commentaries on the Constitution \xc2\xa71536, pp. 397\xe2\x80\x93398 (3d ed. 1858) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here does not seem to have been any exact line drawn, who are and who are not to be deemed <em>inferior</em> officers, in the sense of the constitution\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Edmond</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/651/index.html"></a><a href="/us/520/651/index.html">520 U.

The Court does not clarify the concept.  But without defining who is an inferior officer, to whom the majority\xe2\x80\x99s new rule applies, we cannot know the scope or the coherence of the legal rule that the Court creates.  I understand the virtues of a common-law case-by-case approach.  But here that kind of approach (when applied without more specificity than I can find in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion) threatens serious harm.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem is not simply that the term \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officer\xe2\x80\x9d is indefinite but also that efforts to define it inevitably conclude that the term\xe2\x80\x99s sweep is unusually broad.  Consider the Court\xe2\x80\x99s definitions: Inferior officers are, <em>inter alia,</em> (1) those charged with \xe2\x80\x9cthe administration and enforcement of the public law,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Buckley, </em>424 U.

Individual Members of the Court would add to the list the Federal Communication Commission\xe2\x80\x99s managing director, the Federal Trade Commission\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csecretary,\xe2\x80\x9d the general counsel of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and more generally, bureau chiefs, general counsels, and administrative law judges, see<em> Freytag</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 918\xe2\x80\x93920 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment), as well as \xe2\x80\x9cordinary commissioned military officers,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Weiss, supra,</em> at 182 (Souter, J., concurring).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Reading the criteria above as stringently as possible, I still see no way to avoid sweeping hundreds, perhaps thousands of high level government officials within the scope of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, putting  their job security and their administrative actions and decisions constitutionally at risk.  To make even a conservative estimate, one would have to begin by listing federal departments, offices, bureaus and other agencies whose heads are by statute removable only \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  I have found 48 such agencies, which I have listed in Appendix A, <em>infra</em>.  Then it would be necessary to identify the senior officials in those agencies (just below the top) who themselves are removable only \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause.\xe2\x80\x9d I have identified 573 such high-ranking officials, whom I have listed in Appendix B, <em>infra</em>.  They include most of the leadership of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (including that agency\xe2\x80\x99s executive director as well as the directors of its Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation and Office of Enforcement), virtually all of the leadership of the Social Security Administration, the executive directors of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as the general counsels of the Chemical Safety Board, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Review Commission, and the National Mediation Board.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This list is a conservative estimate because it consists only of career appointees in the Senior Executive Service (SES), see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72101a, 3132(a)(2), a group of high-ranking officials distinct from the \xe2\x80\x9ccompetitive service,\xe2\x80\x9d see \xc2\xa72101(a)(1)(C), who \xe2\x80\x9cserve in the key positions just below the top Presidential appointees,\xe2\x80\x9d Office of Personnel Management, About the Senior Executive Service, online at http://www.opm.gov/ses/about_ses/index.asp; \xc2\xa72102(a)(1)(C), and who are, without exception, subject to \xe2\x80\x9cremoval\xe2\x80\x9d only for cause.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77542\xe2\x80\x937543; see also \xc2\xa72302(a)(2) (substantially limiting conditions under which \xe2\x80\x9ca career appointee in the Senior Executive Service\xe2\x80\x9d may be \xe2\x80\x9ctransfer[red], or reassign[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d).  SES officials include, for example, the Director of the Bureau of Prisons, the Director of the National Drug Intelligence Center, and the Director of the Office of International Monetary Policy in the Treasury Department.  See Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs, United States Government Policy and Supporting Positions (2008), pp. 99, 103, 129 (hereinafter Plum Book).  And by virtually any definition, essentially all SES officials qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officers,\xe2\x80\x9d for their duties, as defined by statute, require them to \xe2\x80\x9cdirec[t] the work of an organizational unit,\xe2\x80\x9d carry out high-level managerial functions, or \xe2\x80\x9c<em>otherwise exercis[e] important policy-making, policy-determining, or other executive functions</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73132(a)(2) (emphasis added).  Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 2 (describing an \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officer\xe2\x80\x9d as someone who \xe2\x80\x9cdetermines the policy and enforces the laws of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>ante, </em>at 26 (acknowledging that career SES appointees in independent agencies may be rendered unconstitutional in future cases).  Is the SES exempt from today\xe2\x80\x99s rule or is it not?  The Court, after listing reasons why the SES may be different, simply says that it will not \xe2\x80\x9caddres[s]\xe2\x80\x9d the matter.  <em>Ante, </em>at 27.  Perhaps it does not do so because it cannot do so without revealing the difficulty of distinguishing the SES from the Accounting Board and thereby also revealing the inherent instability of the legal rule it creates. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The potential list of those whom today\xe2\x80\x99s decision affects is yet larger.  As Justice Scalia has observed, administrative law judges (ALJs) \xe2\x80\x9care all executive officers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Freytag,</em> 501 U. S., at 910 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (emphasis deleted); see also, <em>e.g., id.,</em> at 881 (majority opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] [tax-court] special trial judge is an \xe2\x80\x98inferior Officer\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Edmond, supra,</em> at 654 (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]ilitary trial and appellate judges are [inferior] officers\xe2\x80\x9d).  But cf. <em>ante, </em>at 26, n.\xc2\xa010.  And ALJs are each removable \xe2\x80\x9conly for good cause established and determined by the Merit Systems Protection Board,\xe2\x80\x9d 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77521(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b).  But the members of the Merit Systems Protection Board are themselves protected from removal by the President absent good cause.  \xc2\xa71202(d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0My research reflects that the Federal Government relies on 1,584 ALJs to adjudicate administrative matters in over 25 agencies.  See Appendix C, <em>infra;</em> see also Memorandum of Juanita Love, Office of Personnel Management, to Supreme Court Library (May 28, 2010) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  These ALJs adjudicate Social Security benefits, employment disputes, and other matters highly important to individuals.  Does every losing party before an ALJ now have grounds to appeal on the basis that the decision entered against him is unconstitutional?  Cf. <em>ante, </em>at 26, n. 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]ur holding also does not address\xe2\x80\x9d this question).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And what about the military?  Commissioned military officers \xe2\x80\x9care \xe2\x80\x98inferior officers.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Weiss,</em> 510 U. S., at 182 (Souter, J., concurring); <em>id.,</em> at 169\xe2\x80\x93170 (majority opinion).  There are over 210,000 active-duty commissioned officers currently serving in the armed forces.  See Dept. of Defense, Active Duty Military Personnel by Rank (Apr. 30, 2010), online at http://siadapp.dmdc.osd.mil/personnel/MILITARY/\nrg1004.pdf.  Numerous statutory provisions provide that such officers may not be removed from office except for cause (at least in peacetime).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 10 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7629\xe2\x80\x93632, 804, 1161, 1181\xe2\x80\x931185.  And such officers can generally be so removed only by <em>other </em>commissioned officers, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7612, 825, 1187, who themselves enjoy the same career protections.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority might simply say that the military is different.  But it will have to explain <em>how </em>it is different. It is difficult to see why the Constitution would provide a President who is the military\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommander-in-chief,\xe2\x80\x9d Art.\xc2\xa0II, \xc2\xa72, cl.\xc2\xa01, with <em>less </em>authority to remove \xe2\x80\x9cinferior\xe2\x80\x9d military \xe2\x80\x9cofficers\xe2\x80\x9d than to remove comparable civil officials.

But what is to happen in the meantime?  Is the work of all these various officials to be put on hold while the courts of appeals determine whether today\xe2\x80\x99s ruling applies to them?  Will Congress have to act to remove the \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provisions?  Cf. <em>Buckley</em>, 424 U. S., at 142\xe2\x80\x93143.  Can the President then restore them via executive order?  And, still, what about the military?  A clearer line would help avoid these practical difficulties.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority asserts that its opinion will not affect the Government\xe2\x80\x99s ability to function while these many questions are litigated in the lower courts because the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding concerns only \xe2\x80\x9cthe conditions under which th[e]se officers might some day be removed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 27.  But this case was not brought by federal officials challenging their potential removal.  It was brought by private individuals who were <em>subject to</em> <em>regulation </em>\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>here-and-now</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and who \xe2\x80\x9cobject to the\xe2\x80\x9d very \xe2\x80\x9cexistence\xe2\x80\x9d of the regulators themselves.  <em>Ante, </em>at 33, 8 (emphasis added).  And those private individuals have prevailed.  Thus, any person similarly regulated by a federal official who is potentially subject to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s amorphous new rule will be able to bring an \xe2\x80\x9cimplied private right of action directly under the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cseeking \xe2\x80\xa6 a declaratory judgment that\xe2\x80\x9d the official\xe2\x80\x99s actions are \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional and an injunction preventing the\xe2\x80\x9d official \xe2\x80\x9cfrom exercising [his] powers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante, </em>at 10, n.\xc2\xa02, 6; cf., <em>e.g., Legal Services Corporation</em> v. <em>Velazquez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/533/index.html">531 U.

For a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cability to devise [such] a judicial remedy \xe2\x80\xa6 often depends on how clearly\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9cbackground constitutional rules at issue\xe2\x80\x9d have been \xe2\x80\x9carticulated\xe2\x80\x9d; severance will be unavailable \xe2\x80\x9cin a murky constitutional context,\xe2\x80\x9d which is precisely the context that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rule creates.  <em>Ayotte</em> v. <em>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/546/320/index.html">546 U.

Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9cthe touchstone\xe2\x80\x9d of the severability analysis \xe2\x80\x9cis legislative intent,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 330, and Congress has repeatedly expressed its judgment \xe2\x80\x9cover the last century that it is in the best interest of the country, indeed essential, that federal service should depend upon meritorious performance rather than political service,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Civil Service Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 413 U.

And so it may well be that courts called upon to resolve the many questions the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion raises will not only apply the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rule to its logical conclusion, but will also determine that the only available remedy to certain double for-cause problems is to invalidate entire agencies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, notwithstanding the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertions to the contrary, the potential consequences of today\xe2\x80\x99s holding are worrying.  The upshot, I believe, is a legal dilemma.  To interpret the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision as applicable only in a few circumstances will make the rule less harmful but arbitrary.  To interpret the rule more broadly will make the rule more rational, but destructive.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One last question: How can the Court simply <em>assume </em>without deciding that the SEC Commissioners themselves are removable only \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause?\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante, </em>at 5 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e decide the case with th[e] <em>understanding\xe2\x80\x9d</em> \xe2\x80\x9cthat the Commissioners cannot themselves be removed by the President except\xe2\x80\x9d for cause (emphasis added)).  Unless the Commissioners themselves are <em>in fact</em> protected by a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the Accounting Board statute, on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s own reasoning, is not constitutionally defective.  I am not aware of any other instance in which the Court has similarly (on its own or through stipulation) <em>created</em> a constitutional defect in a statute and then relied on that defect to strike a statute down as unconstitutional.  Cf. <em>Alabama</em> v. <em>North Carolina</em>, 560 U. S. ___, ___ (2010) (opinion for the Court by Scalia, J.) (slip op., at 20) (\xe2\x80\x9cWe do not\xe2\x80\x94we cannot\xe2\x80\x94add provisions to a federal statute \xe2\x80\xa6 especially [if] \xe2\x80\xa6 separation-of-powers concerns \xe2\x80\xa6 would [thereby] arise\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>The Anaconda</em> v. <em>American Sugar Refining Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/322/42/index.html">322 U.

Unlike the statutes establishing the 48 federal agencies listed in Appendix A, <em>infra</em>, the statue that established the Commission says nothing about removal.  It <em>is</em> <em>silent</em> on the question.  As far as its text is concerned, the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority to remove the Commissioners is no different from his authority to remove the Secretary of State or the Attorney General.  See <em>Shurtleff, </em>189 U. S., at 315 (\xe2\x80\x9cTo take away th[e] power of removal \xe2\x80\xa6 would require very clear and explicit language.  It should not be held to be taken away by mere inference or implication\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Memorandum from David J. Barron, Acting Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel, to the Principal Deputy Counsel to the President: Removability of the Federal Coordinator for Alaska Natural Gas Transportation Projects, p.\xc2\xa02 (Oct. 23, 2009), online at http://justice.gov/olc/2009/gas-transport-\nproject.pdf (\xe2\x80\x9c[Where] Congress did not explicitly provide tenure protection \xe2\x80\xa6 the President, consistent with \xe2\x80\xa6 settled principles, may remove \xe2\x80\xa6 without cause\xe2\x80\x9d); The Constitutional Separation of Powers Between the President and Congress, 20 Op. Legal Counsel 124, 170 (1996) (same).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor is the absence of a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision in the statute that created the Commission likely to have been inadvertent.  Congress created the Commission during the 9-year period <em>after</em> this Court decided <em>Myers, </em>and thereby cast serious doubt on the constitutionality of all \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d removal provisions, but <em>before</em> it decided <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor, </em>which removed any doubt in respect to the constitutionality of making commissioners of independent agencies removable only for cause.  In other words, Congress created the SEC at a time when, under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, it would have been <em>unconstitutional </em>to make the Commissioners removable only for cause.  And, during that 9-year period, Congress created at least three major federal agencies without making <em>any </em>of their officers removable for cause.  See 48 Stat. 885, 15 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778d (Securities and Exchange Commission), 48 Stat. 1066, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7154 (Federal Communications Commission); 46 Stat. 797 (Federal Power Commission) (reformed post-<em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor </em>as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission <em>with </em>\xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protection, 91 Stat. 582, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77171).  By way of contrast, only <em>one month</em> after <em>Humphrey\xe2\x80\x99s Executor </em>was decided, Congress returned to its pre-<em>Myers</em> practice of including such provisions in statutes creating independent commissions.  See \xc2\xa73, 49 Stat. 451, 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7153 (establishing National Labor Relations Board with an explicit removal limitation).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that Congress did not make the SEC Commissioners removable \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d does not mean it intended to create a dependent, rather than an independent agency. Agency independence is a function of several different factors, of which \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d protection is only one.  Those factors include, <em>inter alia,</em> an agency\xe2\x80\x99s separate (rather than presidentially dependent) budgeting authority, its separate litigating authority, its composition as a multimember bipartisan board, the use of the word \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d in its authorizing statute, and, above all, a political environment, reflecting tradition and function, that would impose a heavy political cost upon any President who tried to remove a commissioner of the agency without cause.  See generally Breger &amp; Edles 1135\xe2\x80\x931155.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The absence of a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause\xe2\x80\x9d provision is thus not fatal to agency independence.  Indeed, a \xe2\x80\x9cCongressional Research Service official suggests that there are <em>at least</em> 13 \xe2\x80\x98independent\xe2\x80\x99 agencies without a removal provision in their statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1143, n. 161 (emphasis added) (citing congressional testimony).  But it does draw the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule into further confusion.  For not only are we left without a definition of an \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officer,\xe2\x80\x9d but we are also left to guess which department heads will be deemed by the majority to be subject to for-cause removal notwithstanding statutes containing no such provision.  If any agency deemed \xe2\x80\x9cindependent\xe2\x80\x9d will be similarly treated, the scope of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding is even broader still.  See Appendix D, <em>infra</em> (listing agencies potentially affected).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court then, by assumption, reads <em>into</em> the statute books a \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause removal\xe2\x80\x9d phrase that does not appear in the relevant statute and which Congress probably did not intend to write.  And it does so in order to strike down, not to uphold, another statute.  This is not a statutory construction that seeks to avoid a constitutional question, but its opposite.  See <em>Ashwander</em> v. <em>TVA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/297/288/index.html">297 U. S. 288</a>, 347 (1936) (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the habit of the Court to decide questions of a constitutional nature unless absolutely necessary to a decision of the case\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>NLRB </em>v. <em>Catholic Bishop of Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/440/490/index.html">440 U.

But were that not so, a determination that the silent SEC statute means no more than it says would properly avoid the determination of unconstitutionality that the Court now makes.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision is wrong\xe2\x80\x94very wrong. As Parts II\xe2\x80\x93A, II\xe2\x80\x93B, and II\xe2\x80\x93C of this opinion make clear, if the Court were to look to the proper functional and contextual considerations, it would find the Accounting Board provision constitutional.  As Part II\xe2\x80\x93D shows, insofar as the Court instead tries to create a bright-line rule, it fails to do so.  Its rule of decision is both imprecise and overly broad.  In light of the present imprecision, it must either narrow its rule arbitrarily, leaving it to apply virtually alone to the Accounting Board, or it will have to leave in place a broader rule of decision applicable to many other \xe2\x80\x9cinferior officers\xe2\x80\x9d as well.  In doing the latter, it will undermine the President\xe2\x80\x99s authority.  And it will create an obstacle, indeed pose a serious threat, to the proper functioning of that workable Government that the Constitution seeks to create\xe2\x80\x94in provisions this Court is sworn to uphold.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With respect I dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">APPENDIXES</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are 24 stand-alone federal agencies (<em>i.e., \xe2\x80\x9c</em>departments\xe2\x80\x9d) whose heads are, <em>by</em> <em>statute, </em>removable by the President only \xe2\x80\x9cfor cause.\xe2\x80\x9d  Moreover, there are at least 24 additional offices, boards, or bureaus situated within departments that are similarly subject, <em>by statute,</em> to for-cause removal provisions.
