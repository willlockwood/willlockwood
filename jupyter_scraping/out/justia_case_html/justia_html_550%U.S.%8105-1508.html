The statute prohibits a State from offsetting this federal aid by reducing state aid to a local district.  To avoid unreasonably interfering with a state program that seeks to equalize per-pupil expenditures, the statute contains an exception permitting a State to reduce its own local funding on account of the federal aid where the Secretary of Education finds that the state program \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d among local school districts.  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(1).  The Secretary is required to use a formula that compares the local school district with the greatest per-pupil expenditures in a State to the school district with the smallest per-pupil expenditures.  If the former does not exceed the latter by more than 25 percent, the state program qualifies as one that \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  In making this determination, the Secretary must, <em>inter alia,</em> \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard [school districts] with per-pupil expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  Regulations first promulgated 30 years ago provide that the Secretary will first create a list of school districts ranked in order of per-pupil expenditure; then identify the relevant percentile cutoff point on that list based on a specific (95th or 5th) percentile of <em>student population</em>\xe2\x80\x94essentially identifying those districts whose students account for the 5 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s total student population that lies at both the high and low ends of the spending distribution; and finally compare the highest spending and lowest spending of the remaining school districts to see whether they satisfy the statute\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that the disparity between them not exceed 25 percent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Using this formula, Department of Education officials ranked New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s 89 local school districts in order of per-pupil spending for fiscal year 1998, excluding 17 schools at the top because they contained (cumulatively) less than 5 percent of the student population and an additional 6 districts at the bottom.  The remaining 66 districts accounted for approximately 90 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s student population.  Because the disparity between the highest and lowest of the remaining districts was less than 25 percent, the State\xe2\x80\x99s program \xe2\x80\x9cequalize[d] expenditures,\xe2\x80\x9d and the State could offset federal impact aid by reducing its aid to individual districts.  Seeking further review, petitioner school districts (Zuni) claimed that the calculations were correct under the regulations, but that the regulations were inconsistent with the authorizing statute because the Department must calculate the 95th and 5th percentile cutoffs based solely on the number of school districts without considering the number of pupils in those districts.  A Department Administrative Law Judge and the Secretary both rejected this challenge, and the en banc Tenth Circuit ultimately affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The statute permits the Secretary to identify the school districts that should be \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by looking to the <em>number of the district\xe2\x80\x99s pupils</em> as well as to the size of the district\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures per pupil.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d instruction\xe2\x80\x99s history and purpose indicate that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s calculation formula is a reasonable method that carries out Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent in enacting the statutory provision.  For one thing, that method is the kind of highly technical, specialized interstitial matter that Congress does not decide itself, but delegates to specialized agencies to decide.  For another, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s history strongly supports the Secretary.  The present statutory language originated in draft legislation sent by the Secretary himself, which Congress adopted without comment or clarification.  No one at the time\xe2\x80\x94no Member of Congress, no Department of Education official, no school district or State\xe2\x80\x94expressed the view that this statutory language was intended to require, or did require, the Secretary to change the Department\xe2\x80\x99s system of calculation, a system that the Department and school districts across the Nation had followed for nearly 20 years.  Finally, the purpose of the disregard instruction, which is evident in the language of the present statute, is to exclude statistical outliers.  Viewed in terms of this purpose, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method is reasonable, while the reasonableness of Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s proposed method is more doubtful as the then Commissioner of Education explained when he considered the matter in 1976.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method falls within the scope of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.  Neither the legislative history nor the reasonableness of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method would be determinative if the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language unambiguously indicated Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent to foreclose the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  See <em>Chevron, supra, </em>at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  That is not the case here.  Section 7709(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x99s phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>above the 95th percentile \xe2\x80\xa6 of \xe2\x80\xa6 [per-pupil] expenditures</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added) limits the Secretary to calculation methods involving per-pupil expenditures.  It does not tell the Secretary which of several possible methods the Department must use, nor rule out the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s present formula, which distributes districts in accordance with per-pupil expenditures, while essentially weighting each district to reflect the number of pupils it contains.  This interpretation is supported by dictionary definitions of \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile,\xe2\x80\x9d and by the fact that Congress, in other statutes, has clarified the matter at issue to avoid comparable ambiguity.  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]mbiguity is a creature not [just] of definitional possibilities but [also] of statutory context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U. S. 115</a>, 118.  Context here indicates that both students and school districts are of concern to the statute, and, thus, the disregard instruction can include within its scope the distribution of a ranked population consisting of pupils (or of school districts weighted by pupils), not just a ranked distribution of unweighted school districts alone.  Finally, this Court is reassured by the fact that no group of statisticians, nor any individual statistician, has said directly in briefs, or indirectly through citation, that the language in question cannot be read the way it is interpreted here.

The statute instructs the Secretary to calculate the disparity in per-pupil expenditures among local school districts in the State.  But, when doing so, the Secretary is to \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d school districts \xe2\x80\x9c<em>with per-pupil expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 in the State</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question before us is whether the emphasized statutory language permits the Secretary to identify the school districts that should be \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d by looking to the <em>number of the district\xe2\x80\x99s pupils</em> as well as to the size of the district\xe2\x80\x99s expenditures per pupil.  We conclude that it does.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The federal Impact Aid Act, 108 Stat. 3749, as amended, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77701 <em>et seq.</em>, provides financial assistance to local school districts whose ability to finance public school education is adversely affected by a federal presence.  Federal aid is available to districts, for example, where a significant amount of federal land is exempt from local property taxes, or where the federal presence is responsible for an increase in school-age children (say, of armed forces personnel) whom local schools must educate.  See \xc2\xa77701.  The statute typically prohibits a State from offsetting this federal aid by reducing its own state aid to the local district.  If applied without exceptions, however, this prohibition might unreasonably interfere with a state program that seeks to equalize per-pupil expenditures throughout the State, for instance, by preventing the state program from taking account of a significant source of federal funding that some local school districts receive.  The statute consequently contains an exception that permits a State to compensate for federal impact aid where \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary [of Education] determine[s] and certifies \xe2\x80\xa6 that the State has in effect a program of State aid that <em>equalizes</em> expenditures for free public education among local [school districts] in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statute sets out a formula that the Secretary of Education must use to determine whether a state aid program satisfies the federal \xe2\x80\x9cequaliz[ation]\xe2\x80\x9d requirement.  The formula instructs the Secretary to compare the local school district with the greatest per-pupil expenditures to the school district with the smallest per-pupil expenditures to see whether the former exceeds the latter by more than 25 percent.  So long as it does not, the state aid program qualifies as a program that \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  More specifically the statute provides that \xe2\x80\x9ca program of state aid\xe2\x80\x9d qualifies, <em>i.e.</em>, it \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d among local school districts if,</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cin the second fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made, the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by [the local school district] with the highest such per-pupil expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by [the local school district] with the lowest such expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 by more than 25 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(A) (2000 ed.).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory provision goes on to set forth what we shall call the \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d instruction.  It states that, when \xe2\x80\x9cmaking\xe2\x80\x9d this \xe2\x80\x9cdetermination,\xe2\x80\x9d the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Secretary shall \xe2\x80\xa6 disregard [school districts] with per-pupil expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).  It adds that the Secretary shall further:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9ctake into account the extent to which [the state program reflects the special additional costs that some school districts must bear when they are] geographically isolated [or when they provide education for] particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(ii).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case requires us to decide whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s present calculation method is consistent with the federal statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d instruction.  The method at issue is contained in a set of regulations that the Secretary first promulgated 30 years ago.  Those regulations essentially state the following:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When determining whether a state aid program \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d (thereby permitting the State to reduce its own local funding on account of federal impact aid), the Secretary will first create a list of school districts ranked in order of per-pupil expenditure.  The Secretary will then identify the relevant percentile cutoff point on that list on the basis of a specific (95th or 5th) percentile of <em>student population</em>\xe2\x80\x94essentially identifying those districts whose students account for the 5 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s total student population that lies at both the high and low ends of the spending distribution.

The percentage disparity between the 95th percentile and the 5th percentile [school districts] is 22 percent ($1000$820 = $180/$820).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\nBecause 22 percent is less than the statutory \xe2\x80\x9c25 percent\xe2\x80\x9d requirement, the state program in the example qualifies as a program that \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case concerns the Department of Education\xe2\x80\x99s application of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s  regulations to New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s local district aid program in respect to fiscal year 2000.  As the regulations require, Department officials listed each of New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s 89 local school districts in order of per-pupil spending for fiscal year 1998.  (The calculation in New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s case was performed, as the statute allows, on the basis of per-pupil revenues</em>, rather than per-pupil <em>expenditures</em>.  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(A).  See also Appendix B, <em>infra.</em>  For ease of reference we nevertheless refer, in respect to New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s figures and throughout the opinion, only to \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d)  After ranking the districts, Department officials excluded 17 school districts at the top of the list because those districts contained (cumulatively) less than 5 percent of the student population; for the same reason, they excluded an additional 6 school districts at the bottom of the list.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The remaining 66 districts accounted for approximately 90 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s student population.  Of those, the highest ranked district spent $3,259 per student; the lowest ranked district spent $2,848 per student.  The difference, $411, was less than 25 percent of the lowest per-pupil figure, namely $2,848.  Hence, the officials found that New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s local aid program qualifies as a program that \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  New Mexico was therefore free to offset federal impact aid to individual districts by reducing state aid to those districts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two of New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s public school districts, Zuni Public School District and Gallup-McKinley County Public School District (whom we shall collectively call Zuni), sought further agency review of these findings.  Zuni conceded that the Department\xe2\x80\x99s calculations were correct in terms of the Department\xe2\x80\x99s own regulations.  Zuni argued, however, that the regulations themselves are inconsistent with the authorizing statute.  That statute, in its view, requires the Department to calculate the 95th and 5th percentile cutoffs solely on the basis of the number of school districts (ranked by their per-pupil expenditures), without any consideration of the number of pupils in those districts.  If calculated as Zuni urges, only 10 districts (accounting for less than 2 percent of all students) would have been identified as the outliers that the statute instructs the Secretary to disregard.  The difference, as a result, between the highest and lowest per-pupil expenditures of the remaining districts (26.9 percent) would exceed 25 percent.  Consequently, the statute would forbid New Mexico to take account of federal impact aid as it decides how to equalize school funding across the State.  See N.\xc2\xa0M. Stat. Ann. \xc2\xa722\xe2\x80\x938\xe2\x80\x931 <em>et seq</em>. (2006).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Department of Education Administrative Law Judge rejected Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the regulations.  The Secretary of Education did the same.  Zuni sought review of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s decision in the Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  393 F.\xc2\xa03d 1158 (2004).  Initially, a Tenth Circuit panel affirmed the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s determination by a split vote (2 to 1).  Subsequently, the full Court of Appeals vacated the panel\xe2\x80\x99s decision and heard the matter en banc.  The 12-member en banc court affirmed the Secretary but by an evenly divided court (6 to 6).  437 F.\xc2\xa03d 1289 (2006).  Zuni sought certiorari.  We agreed to decide the matter.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s strongest argument rests upon the literal language of the statute.  Zuni concedes, as it must, that if the language of the statute is open or ambiguous\xe2\x80\x94that is, if Congress left a \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d for the agency to fill\xe2\x80\x94then we must uphold the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation as long as it is reasonable.

For purposes of exposition, we depart from a normal order of discussion, namely an order that first considers Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s statutory language argument.  See <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U. S. 438</a>, 450 (2002).  Instead, because of the technical nature of the language in question, we shall first examine the provision\xe2\x80\x99s background and basic purposes.  That discussion will illuminate our subsequent analysis in Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>infra</em>.  It will also reveal why Zuni concentrates its argument upon language alone.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considerations other than language provide us with unusually strong indications that Congress intended to leave the Secretary free to use the calculation method before us and that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s chosen method is a reasonable one.  For one thing, the matter at issue\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, the calculation method for determining whether a state aid program \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is the kind of highly technical, specialized interstitial matter that Congress often does not decide itself, but delegates to specialized agencies to decide.

(opinion of Scalia, J.).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the history of the statute strongly supports the Secretary.  Congress first enacted an impact aid \xe2\x80\x9cequalization\xe2\x80\x9d exception in 1974.  The exception originally provided that the \xe2\x80\x9cter[m] \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98equaliz[ing] expenditures\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be defined by the [Secretary].\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7240(d)(2)(B) (1970 ed., Supp. IV).  Soon thereafter, in 1976, the Secretary promulgated the regulation here at issue defining the term \xe2\x80\x9cequalizing expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d in the manner now before us.  See Part I\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>supra</em>.  As far as we can tell, no Member of Congress has ever criticized the method the 1976 regulation sets forth nor suggested at any time that it be revised or reconsidered.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The present statutory language originated in draft legislation that the Secretary himself sent to Congress in 1994.  With one minor change (irrelevant to the present calculation controversy), Congress adopted that language without comment or clarification.  No one at the time\xe2\x80\x94no Member of Congress, no Department of Education official, no school district or State\xe2\x80\x94expressed the view that this statutory language (which, after all, was supplied by the Secretary) was intended to require, or did require, the Secretary to change the Department\xe2\x80\x99s system of calculation, a system that the Department and school districts across the Nation had followed for nearly 20 years, without (as far as we are told) any adverse effect.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, viewed in terms of the purpose of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s disregard instruction, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method is reasonable, while the reasonableness of a method based upon the number of districts alone (Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s proposed  method) is more doubtful.  When the Secretary (then Commissioner) of Education considered the matter in 1976, he explained why that is so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Initially the Secretary pointed out that the \xe2\x80\x9cexclusion of the upper and bottom 5 percentile school districts is based upon the accepted principle of statistical evaluation that such percentiles usually represent <em>unique</em> or <em>noncharacteristic</em> situations.\xe2\x80\x9d  41 Fed. Reg. 26320 (1976) (emphasis added).  That purpose, a purpose to exclude statistical outliers, is evident in the language of the present statute.  The provision uses the technical term \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile\xe2\x80\x9d; it refers to cutoff numbers (\xe2\x80\x9c95th\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c5th\xe2\x80\x9d) often associated with scientific calculations; and it directly precedes another statutory provision that tells the Secretary to account for those districts, from among the middle 5th to 95th percentile districts, that remain \xe2\x80\x9cnoncharacteristic\xe2\x80\x9d in respect to geography or the presence of special students (such as disabled students).  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i)\xe2\x80\x93(ii).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Secretary added that under the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s calculation system the \xe2\x80\x9cpercentiles\xe2\x80\x9d would be \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined on the basis of numbers of pupils and not on the basis of numbers of districts.\xe2\x80\x9d  41 Fed. Reg. 26324.  He said that to base \xe2\x80\x9can exclusion on numbers of districts\xe2\x80\x9d alone  \xe2\x80\x9cwould act to apply the disparity standard in an unfair and inconsistent manner among States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  He then elaborated upon his concerns:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the exclusion is to eliminate those anomalous characteristics of a distribution of expenditures.  In States with a small number of large districts, an exclusion based on percentage of school districts might exclude from the measure of disparity a substantial percentage of the pupil population in those States.  Conversely, in States with large numbers of small districts, such an approach might exclude only an insignificant fraction of the pupil population and would not exclude anomalous characteristics.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s first problem, consider an exaggerated example, say a State with 80 school districts of unequal size.  Suppose 8 of the districts include urban areas and together account for 70 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s students, while the remaining 72 districts include primarily rural areas and together account for 30 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s students.  If the State\xe2\x80\x99s greatest funding disparities are among the 8 urban districts, Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s calculation method (which looks only at the number of districts and ignores their size) would require the Secretary to disregard the system\xe2\x80\x99s 8 largest districts (<em>i.e.</em>, 10 percent of the number 80) even though those 8 districts (because they together contain 70 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s pupils) are typical of, indeed characterize, the State\xe2\x80\x99s public school system.  It would require the Secretary instead to measure the system\xe2\x80\x99s expenditure equality by looking only to noncharacteristic districts that are not representative of the system as a whole, indeed districts accounting for only 30 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s pupils.  Thus, according to Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s method, the Secretary would have to certify a state aid program as one that \xe2\x80\x9cequalizes expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d even if there were gross disparities in per-pupil expenditures among urban districts accounting for 70 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s students.  By way of contrast, the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method, by taking into account a district\xe2\x80\x99s size as well as its expenditures, would avoid a calculation that would produce results so contrary to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s objective.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To understand the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s second problem consider this very case.  New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s 89 school districts vary significantly in respect to the number of pupils each contains.  Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s calculation system nonetheless forbids the Secretary to discount more than 10 districts\xe2\x80\x9410 percent of the total number of districts (rounded up).  But these districts taken together account for only 1.8 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s pupils.  To eliminate only those districts, instead of eliminating districts that together account for 10 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s pupils, risks resting the \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard\xe2\x80\x9d calculation upon a few particularly extreme noncharacteristic districts, yet again contrary to the statute\xe2\x80\x99s intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the history and purpose of the disregard instruction indicate that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s calculation formula is a reasonable method that carries out Congress\xe2\x80\x99 likely intent in enacting the statutory provision before us.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s literal language?  The matter is important, for normally neither the legislative history nor the reasonableness of the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method would be determinative if the plain language of the statute unambiguously indicated that Congress sought to foreclose the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  And Zuni argues that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s formula could not possibly effectuate Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent since the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language literally forbids the Secretary to use such a method.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, if the intent of Congress is clear and unambiguously expressed by the statutory language at issue, that would be the end of our analysis.  See <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  A customs statute that imposes a tariff on \xe2\x80\x9cclothing\xe2\x80\x9d does not impose a tariff on automobiles, no matter how strong the policy arguments for treating the two kinds of goods alike.  But we disagree with Zuni\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, for we believe that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method falls within the scope of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain language.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That language says that, when the Secretary compares (for a specified fiscal year) \xe2\x80\x9cthe amount of per-pupil expenditures made by\xe2\x80\x9d (1) the highest-per-pupil-expenditure district and (2) the lowest-per-pupil-expenditure district, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Secretary shall \xe2\x80\xa6 disregard\xe2\x80\x9d local school districts \xe2\x80\x9cwith per-pupil expenditures \xe2\x80\xa6 above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  The word \xe2\x80\x9csuch\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d (or more precisely to \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d in the test year specified by the statute). The question then is whether the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>above the 95th percentile \xe2\x80\xa6 of \xe2\x80\xa6 [per pupil] expenditures</em>\xe2\x80\x9d permits the Secretary to calculate percentiles by (1) ranking local districts, (2) noting the student population of each district, and (3) determining the cutoff point on the basis of districts containing 95 percent (or 5 percent) of the State\xe2\x80\x99s students.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our answer is that this phrase, taken with absolute literalness, limits the Secretary to calculation methods that involve \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  But it does not tell the Secretary which of several different possible methods the Department must use.  Nor does it rule out the present formula, which distributes districts in accordance with per-pupil expenditures, while essentially weighting each district to reflect the number of pupils it contains.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the statute uses technical language (<em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile\xe2\x80\x9d) and seeks a technical purpose (eliminating uncharacteristic, or outlier, districts), we have examined dictionary definitions of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 41 Fed. Reg. 26320 (Congress intended measurements based upon an \xe2\x80\x9caccepted principle of <em>statistical</em> evaluation\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Those definitions make clear that \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile\xe2\x80\x9d refers to a division of a distribution of <em>some</em> population into 100 parts.  Thus, Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third New International Dictionary 1675 (1961) (Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third) defines \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9cthe value of the statistical variable that marks the boundary between any two consecutive intervals in a distribution of 100 intervals each containing one percent of the total population.\xe2\x80\x9d  A standard economics dictionary gives a similar definition for \xe2\x80\x9cpercentiles\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe values separating hundredth parts of a distribution, arranged in order of size.  The 99th percentile of the income distribution, for example, is the income level such that only one percent of the population have larger incomes.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Black, A Dictionary of Economics 348\xe2\x80\x93349 (2d ed. 2002).</p>\n<p align="left">\nA dictionary of mathematics states: \xe2\x80\x9cThe <em>n</em>-th percentile is the value <em>x<font i="1" super="-1">n<font super="-1">/100</font></font></em><font i="1" super="-1"><font super="-1"> such that <em>n</em> per cent of the population is less than or equal to <em>x<font i="1" super="-1">n<font super="-1">/100</font></font></em><font i="1" super="-1"><font super="-1">.\xe2\x80\x9d  It adds that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he terms can be modified, though not always very satisfactorily, to be applicable to a discrete random variable or to a large sample ranked in ascending order.\xe2\x80\x9d  C. Clapham &amp; J. Nicholson, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics 378\xe2\x80\x93379 (3d ed. 2005) (emphasis deleted).  The American Heritage Science Dictionary 468 (2005) explains that a percentile is \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny of the 100 equal parts into which the range of the values of a set of data can be divided in order to show the distribution of those values.\xe2\x80\x9d  And Merriam-Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Medical Desk Dictionary 612 (2002) describes percentile as \xe2\x80\x9ca value on a scale of one hundred that indicates the percent of a distribution that is equal to or below it.\xe2\x80\x9d</font></font></font></font></p><font i="1" super="-1"><font super="-1"><font i="1" super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These definitions, mainstream and technical, all indicate that, in order to identify the relevant percentile cutoffs, the Secretary must construct a distribution of values.  That distribution will consist of a \xe2\x80\x9cpopulation\xe2\x80\x9d ranked according to a characteristic.  That characteristic takes on a \xe2\x80\x9cvalue\xe2\x80\x9d for each member of the relevant population.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s instruction to identify the 95th and 5th \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile of such expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d makes clear that the relevant <em>characteristic</em> for ranking purposes is per-pupil expenditure during a particular year.  But the statute does not specify precisely what <em>population</em> is to be \xe2\x80\x9cdistributed\xe2\x80\x9d (<em>i.e.</em>, ranked according to the population\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding values for the relevant characteristic).  Nor does it set forth various details as to how precisely the distribution is to be constructed (as long as it is ranked according to the specified characteristic).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But why is Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence in respect to these matters significant?  Are there several <em>different </em>populations, relevant here, that one might rank according to \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d (and thereby determine in several <em>different</em> ways a cutoff point such that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>n</em> percent of [that] population\xe2\x80\x9d falls, say below the percentile cutoff)?  We are not experts in statistics, but a statistician is not needed to see what the dictionary does not say.  No dictionary definition we have found suggests that there is any <em>single</em> logical, mathematical, or statistical link between, on the one hand, the characterizing data (used for ranking purposes) and, on the other hand, the nature of the relevant population or how that population might be weighted for purposes of determining a percentile cutoff.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Here, the Secretary has distributed districts, ranked them according to per-pupil expenditure, but compared only those that account for 90 percent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s pupils.  Thus, the Secretary has used\xe2\x80\x94as his predecessors had done for a quarter century before him\xe2\x80\x94the State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>students </em>as the relevant population for calculating the specified percentiles.  Another Secretary might have distributed districts, ranked them by per-pupil expenditure, and made no reference to the number of pupils (a method that satisfies the statute\xe2\x80\x99s <em>language </em>but threatens the problems the Secretary long ago identified, see 41 Fed. Reg. 26324; <em>supra, </em>at 4\xe2\x80\x935).  A third Secretary might have distributed districts, ranked them by per-pupil expenditure, but compared only those that account for 90 percent of total pupil expenditures in the State.  A fourth Secretary might have distributed districts, ranked them by per-pupil expenditure, but calculated the 95th and 5th percentile cutoffs using the per-pupil expenditures of all the individual <em>schools </em>in the State.  See 41 Fed. Reg. 26324 (considering this system of calculation).  A fifth Secretary might have distributed districts, ranked them by per-pupil expenditure, but accounted in his disparity calculation for the sometimes significant differences in per-pupil spending at different grade levels. See 34 CFR \xc2\xa7222.162(b)(1) (2006) (authorizing such a system); <em>id.,</em> pt. 222, subpt. K, App.  See also Appendix B,<em> infra.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Each of these methods amounts to a different way of determining which districts fall between the 5th and 95th \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile of per-pupil expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  For purposes of that calculation, they each adopt different populations\xe2\x80\x94students, districts, schools, and grade levels.  Yet, linguistically speaking, one may attribute the characteristic<em> </em>of per-pupil expenditure to each member of any such population (though the values of that characteristic may be more or less readily available depending on the chosen population, see 41 Fed. Reg. 26324).  Hence, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s literal language covers any or all of these methods.  That language alone does not tell us (or the Secretary of Education), however, which method to use.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s claim that this interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cdefies any semblance of normal English\xe2\x80\x9d depends upon its own definition of the word \xe2\x80\x9cper.\xe2\x80\x9d  That word, according to the dissent, \xe2\x80\x9cconnotes . . . a single average figure assigned to a unit the composite members of which are individual pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 6 (dissenting opinion) (emphasis omitted).  In fact, the word \xe2\x80\x9cper\xe2\x80\x9d simply means \xe2\x80\x9c[f]or each\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfor every.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1171 (8th ed. 1999); see Webster\xe2\x80\x99s Third 1674.  Thus, nothing in the English language forbids the Secretary from considering expenditures <em>for</em> <em>each</em> individual pupil in a district when instructed to look at a district\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures.\xe2\x80\x9d  The remainder of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument, colorful language to the side, rests upon a reading of the statutory language that ignores its basic purpose and history.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We find additional evidence for our understanding of the language in the fact that Congress, in other statutes, has clarified the matter here at issue thereby avoiding comparable ambiguity.  For example, in a different education-related statute, Congress refers to \xe2\x80\x9cthe school at the 20th percentile in the State, <em>based on enrollment</em>, among all schools <em>ranked by the percentage of students at the proficient level</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76311(b)(2)(E)(ii) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added).  In another statute fixing charges for physicians services, Congress specified that the maximum charge \xe2\x80\x9cshall be the 50th percentile of the customary charges for the service <em>(weighted by the frequency of the service)</em> performed by nonparticipating physicians in the locality during the [prior] 12-month period.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71395u(j)(1)(C)(v) (2000 ed.) (emphasis added). In these statutes Congress indicated with greater specificity how a percentile should be determined by stating precisely not only which data values are of interest, but also (in the first) the population that is to be distributed and (in the second) the weightings needed to make the calculation meaningful and to avoid counterproductive results.  In the statute at issue here, however, Congress used more general language (drafted by the Secretary himself), which leaves the Secretary with the authority to resolve such subsidiary matters at the administrative level.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also find support for our view of the language in the more general circumstance that statutory \xe2\x80\x9c[a]mbiguity is a creature not [just] of definitional possibilities but [also] of statutory context.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Brown</em> v. <em>Gardner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/115/index.html">513 U. S. 115</a>, 118 (1994).  See also <em>FDA</em> v. <em>Brown &amp; Williamson Tobacco Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/120/index.html">529 U. S. 120</a>, 132\xe2\x80\x93133 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[m]eaning\xe2\x80\x94<em>or ambiguity</em>\xe2\x80\x94of certain words or phrases may only become evident when placed in context\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  That may be so even if statutory language is highly technical.  After all, the scope of what seems a precise technical chess instruction, such as \xe2\x80\x9cyou must place the queen next to the king,\xe2\x80\x9d varies with context, depending, for example, upon whether the instructor is telling a beginner how to set up the board or telling an advanced player how to checkmate an opponent.  The dictionary acknowledges that, when interpreting technical statistical language, the purpose of the exercise matters, for it says that \xe2\x80\x9cquantile,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cquartile,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdecile\xe2\x80\x9d are  \xe2\x80\x9cterms [that] can be modified, though not always very satisfactorily, to be applicable to \xe2\x80\xa6 a large sample ranked in ascending order.\xe2\x80\x9d  Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics, at 379.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, an instruction to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify schools with average scholastic aptitude test scores below the 5th percentile of such scores\xe2\x80\x9d may vary as to the population to be distributed, depending upon whether the context is one of providing additional counseling and support to <em>students </em>at low-performing schools (in which case the relevant population would likely consist of students), or one of identifying unsuccessful learning protocols at low-performing schools (in which case the appropriate population may well be the schools themselves).  Context here tells us that the instruction to identify school districts with \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d above the 95th percentile \xe2\x80\x9cof such expenditures\xe2\x80\x9d is similarly ambiguous, because both students and school districts are of concern to the statute.  Accordingly, the disregard instruction can include within its scope the distribution of a ranked population that consists of pupils (or of school districts weighted by pupils) and not just a ranked distribution of unweighted school districts alone. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, we draw reassurance from the fact that no group of statisticians, nor any individual statistician, has told us directly in briefs, or indirectly through citation, that the language before us cannot be read as we have read it.  This circumstance is significant, for the statutory language is technical, and we are not statisticians.  And the views of experts (or their absence) might help us understand (though not control our determination of) what Congress had in mind.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The upshot is that the language of the statute is broad enough to permit the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s reading.  That fact requires us to look beyond the language to determine whether the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is a reasonable, hence permissible, implementation of the statute.  See <em>Chevron</em>, 467 U. S., at 842\xe2\x80\x93843.  For the reasons set forth in Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>, we conclude that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s reading is a reasonable reading.

As long as that driving policy is faithful to the intent of Congress (or, as in this case, aims only to give effect to such intent)\xe2\x80\x94which it must be if it is to override a strict interpretation of the text\xe2\x80\x94the decision is also a correct performance of the judicial function.  Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s argument today rests on the incorrect premise that every policy-driven interpretation implements a judge\xe2\x80\x99s personal view of sound policy, rather than a faithful attempt to carry out the will of the legislature.  Quite the contrary is true of the work of the judges with whom I have worked for many years.  If we presume that our judges are intellectually honest\xe2\x80\x94as I do\xe2\x80\x94there is no reason to fear \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy-driven interpretation[s]\xe2\x80\x9d of Acts of Congress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Chevron U.

That text is sufficiently ambiguous to justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s exegesis, but my own vote is the product of a more direct route to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s patently correct conclusion.  This happens to be a case in which the legislative history is pellucidly clear and the statutory text is difficult to fathom.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Moreover, it is a case in which I cannot imagine anyone accusing any Member of the Court of voting one way or the other because of that Justice\xe2\x80\x99s own policy preferences.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the clarity of the evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cintention on the precise question at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d I would affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals even if I thought that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 literal reading of the statutory text was correct.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The only \xe2\x80\x9cpolicy\xe2\x80\x9d by which I have been driven is that which this Court has endorsed on repeated occasions regarding the importance of remaining faithful to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 intent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wisconsin Public Intervenor</em> v. <em>Mortier,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/597/index.html">501 U.

The opinion purports to place a premium on the plain text of the Impact Aid statute, <em>ante</em>, at 11, but it first takes us instead on a roundabout tour of \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsiderations <em>other </em>than language,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7 (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94page after page of unenacted congressional intent and judicially perceived statutory purpose, Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>ante</em>.  Only after we are shown \xe2\x80\x9cwhy Zuni concentrates its argument upon language alone,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante,</em> at 7 (impliedly a shameful practice, or at least indication of a feeble case), are we informed how the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain text does not unambiguously <em>preclude</em> the interpretation the Court thinks best.  Part II\xe2\x80\x93B, <em>ante</em> (beginning \xe2\x80\x9cBut what of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s literal language?  The matter is important . . . \xe2\x80\x9d).  This is a most suspicious order of proceeding, since our case law is full of statements such as \xe2\x80\x9cWe begin, as always, with the language of the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Duncan</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/167/index.html">533 U. S. 167</a>, 172 (2001), and replete with the affirmation that, when \xe2\x80\x9c[g]iven [a] straightforward statutory command, there is no reason to resort to legislative history,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzales</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/1/index.html">520 U. S. 1</a>, 6 (1997).  Nor is this cart-before-the-horse approach justified by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s excuse that the statute before us is, after all, a technical one, <em>ante</em>, at 7.  This Court, charged with interpreting, among other things, the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, and the Clean Air Act, confronts technical language all the time, but we never see fit to pronounce upon what we think Congress <em>meant </em>a statute to say, and what we think sound policy would <em>counsel </em>it to say, before considering what it <em>does</em> say.  As almost a majority of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority worries, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]ere the inversion [of inquiry] to become systemic, it would create the impression that agency policy concerns, rather than the traditional tools of statutory construction, are shaping the judicial interpretation of statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (Kennedy, J., joined by Alito, J., concurring).  True enough\xe2\x80\x94except I see no reason to wait for the distortion to become systemic before concluding that that is precisely what is happening in the present case.  For some, policy-driven interpretation is apparently just fine.  See <em>ante</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932 (Stevens, J., concurring).  But for everyone else, let us return to Statutory Interpretation 101.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We must begin, as we always do, with the text.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Gonzales, supra</em>, at 4.  Under the federal Impact Aid program, 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77701 <em>et seq. </em>(2000 ed. and Supp. IV), States distributing state aid to local school districts (referred to in the statute as \xe2\x80\x9clocal educational agencies,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLEAs\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]) may not take into account the amount of federal Impact Aid that its LEAs receive.  See \xc2\xa77709(a).  But the statute makes an exception if the Secretary of Education certifies that a State \xe2\x80\x9chas in effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education among local educational agencies in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Congress has specified a formula for the Secretary to use when making this equalization determination:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] program of State aid equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies if . . . the amount of per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the highest such per-pupil expenditures or revenues did not exceed the amount of such per-pupil expenditures made by, or per-pupil revenues available to, the local educational agency in the State with the lowest such expenditures or revenues by more than 25 percent.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(A).</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Secretary is further instructed, however, that when making this determination, she shall \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard local educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of such expenditures or revenues in the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  It is this latter subsection which concerns us here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The casual observer will notice that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations do not look much like the statute.  The regulations first require the Secretary to rank all of the LEAs in a State (New Mexico has 89) according to their per-pupil expenditures or revenues.  34 CFR pt. 222, subpt. K, App. \xc2\xb6(1)(a)(i) (2006).  So far so good.  But critically here, the Secretary must then \xe2\x80\x9c[i]dentif[y] those LEAs . . . that fall at the 95th and 5th percentiles <em>of the total number of pupils in attendance</em> in the schools of those LEAs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6(1)(a)(ii) (emphasis added).  Finally, the Secretary compares the per-pupil figures of <em>those two</em> LEAs for the purpose of assessing whether a State exceeds the 25% disparity measure.  <em>Id.,</em> \xc2\xb6(1)(a)(iii).  The majority concludes that this method of calculation, with its focus on student population, is a permissible interpretation of the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It most assuredly is not.  To understand why, one first must look beyond the smokescreen that the Court lays down with its repeated apologies for inexperience in statistics, and its endless recitation of technical mathematical definitions of the word \xe2\x80\x9cpercentile.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98The <em>n</em>-th percentile is the value <em>x<font super="-1">n/100</font></em><font super="-1"> such that <em>n</em> per cent of the population is less than or equal to <em>x<font super="-1">n/100</font></em><font super="-1">.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting C. Clapham &amp; J. Nicholson, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Mathematics 378 (3d ed. 2005))).  This case is not a scary math problem; it is a straightforward matter of statutory interpretation.  And we do not need the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical cadre of number-crunching <em>amici</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 17, to guide our way.</font></font></p><font super="-1"><font super="-1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that for purposes relevant here \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98percentile\xe2\x80\x99 refers to a division of a distribution of <em>some</em> population into 100 parts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 12.  And there is further no dispute that the statute concerns the percentile of \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d for that is what the word \xe2\x80\x9csuch\xe2\x80\x9d refers to.  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) (Secretary shall \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard local educational agencies with <em>per-pupil expenditures or revenues</em> above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile of <em>such</em> expenditures or revenues in the State\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The question is: Whose per-pupil expenditures or revenues?  Or, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s terminology, what \xe2\x80\x9cpopulation\xe2\x80\x9d is assigned the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacteristic\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d?  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  At first blush, second blush, or twenty-second blush, the answer is abundantly clear: local educational agencies.  The statute requires the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9cdisregard local educational agencies with\xe2\x80\x9d certain per-pupil figures above or below specified percentiles of those per-pupil figures.  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  The attribute \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditur[e] or revenu[e]\xe2\x80\x9d is assigned to LEAs\xe2\x80\x94there is no mention of student population whatsoever.  And thus under the statute, \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues\xe2\x80\x9d are to be arrayed using a population consisting of LEAs, so that percentiles are determined from a list of (in New Mexico) 89 per-pupil expenditures or revenues representing the 89 LEAs in the State.  It is just that simple.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes little effort to defend the regulations as they are written.  Instead, relying on a made-for-litigation theory that bears almost no relationship to the regulations themselves, the Court believes it has found a way to shoehorn those regulations into the statute.  The Impact Aid statute is ambiguous, the Court says, because it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not specify precisely what <em>population</em> is to be \xe2\x80\x98distributed\xe2\x80\x99 (<em>i.e.</em>, ranked according to the population\xe2\x80\x99s corresponding values for the relevant characteristic).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13<em>.</em>  Thus the Court finds that it is permissible for the Secretary to attribute the characteristic \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d to pupils, with the result that the Secretary may \xe2\x80\x9cus[e] . . . the State\xe2\x80\x99s <em>students</em> as the relevant population for calculating the specified percentiles.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 14.  Under that interpretation, as the State manages to explain with a straight face, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n New Mexico, during the time at issue, there were approximately 317,777 pupils in the [S]tate and thus there were 317,777 per-pupil revenues in the [S]tate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent New Mexico Public Education Department 37; see also <em>id.,</em> at 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cEach and every student in an LEA and in a [S]tate may be treated as having his or her own \xe2\x80\x98per-pupil\xe2\x80\x99 expenditure or revenue amount\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court consequently concludes that \xe2\x80\x9clinguistically speaking, one may attribute the characteristic of per-pupil expenditure to each [student].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sheer applesauce of this statutory interpretation should be obvious.  It is of course true that every student in New Mexico causes an expenditure or produces a revenue that his LEA either enjoys (in the case of revenues) or is responsible for (in the case of expenditures).  But it simply defies any semblance of normal English usage to say that every pupil has a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>per-pupil</em> expenditure or revenue.\xe2\x80\x9d  The word \xe2\x80\x9cper\xe2\x80\x9d <em>connotes </em>that the expenditure or revenue is a single average figure assigned to a unit the <em>composite members of which</em> are individual pupils.  And the only such unit mentioned in the statute is the local educational agency.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  It is simply irrelevant that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o dictionary definition . . . suggests that there is any <em>single</em> logical, mathematical, or statistical link between [per-pupil expenditures or revenues] and . . . the nature of the relevant population.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  Of course there is not.  It is the <em>text </em>at issue which must identify the relevant population, and it does so here quite unambiguously: \xe2\x80\x9c<em>local educational agencies</em> with per-pupil expenditures or revenues.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) (emphasis added).  That same phrase shows the utter irrelevance of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s excursus upon the meaning of the word \xe2\x80\x9cper.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 15.  It does indeed mean \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98for each or \xe2\x80\x98for every\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and when it is contained in a clause that reads \xe2\x80\x9clocal educational agencies with per-pupil expenditures or revenues\xe2\x80\x9d it refers to (and can only refer to) the average expenditure or revenue \xe2\x80\x9cfor each\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cfor every\xe2\x80\x9d student out of the total expenditures or revenues of the LEA.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The violence done to this statute would be severe enough if the Secretary <em>used</em> the actual expenditure or revenue for each individual pupil.  But in fact the Secretary determines the per-pupil expenditure or revenue for each individual student by (guess what) <em>computing the per-pupil expenditure or revenue of each LEA!</em>  As the New Mexico brief explains:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[A] per-pupil expenditure or revenue is an average number.  It is not the amount actually spent on any given pupil, an amount which would be impossible to calculate in any meaningful way.  It is roughly the total amount expended by an LEA divided by the number of pupils in that LEA.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent New Mexico Public Education Department 36.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe Secretary thus assigns an artificial number to each student that corresponds exactly to <em>his LEA\xe2\x80\x99s</em> per-pupil expenditure or revenue.  In other words, at the end of the day the Secretary herself acknowledges that \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues\xe2\x80\x9d pertains to LEAs, and not students.  And she is interpreting \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d <em>not </em>as the Court suggests (an amount attributable to each student), but rather <em>as I suggest </em>(an average amount for the pupils in a particular LEA).  But she then proceeds to take a step not at all permitted by the statutory formula\xe2\x80\x94in effect applying \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>second </em>time (this time according to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s fanciful interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil\xe2\x80\x9d) in order to reach the result she desires.  Of course, if the Secretary did apply the \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d only once, arraying students by their actual expenditures or revenues, her entire system would collapse.  Students from the same LEA, rather than appearing on the list with the same per-pupil figure, would be located at various points on the spectrum.  And so long as an LEA had at least one student above the 95th or below the 5th percentile of pupil \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues,\xe2\x80\x9d that LEA would have to be excluded from the disparity analysis.  The result would be a serious distortion of the disparity determination, excluding many more LEAs (in fact, perhaps all of them) from the disparity calculation.  This would render the 25% disparity measure in \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(A) all but meaningless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court makes one final attempt to rescue the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, appealing to \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory context.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xe2\x80\x9cContext here tells us,\xe2\x80\x9d it says, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the instruction to identify school districts with \xe2\x80\x98per-pupil expenditures\xe2\x80\x99 above the 95th percentile \xe2\x80\x98of such expenditures\xe2\x80\x99 is . . . ambiguous, because both students and school districts are of concern to the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.  This is a complete non sequitur.  Of course students are a concern to a statute dealing with school funding.  But that does not create any ambiguity with respect to whether, under this statute, pupils can reasonably be said to have their own \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is simply irrational to say that the clear dispositions of a statute with regard to the entities that it regulates (here LEAs) are rendered ambiguous when those entities contain sub-units that are the ultimate beneficiaries of the regulation (here students).  Such a principle of interpretation\xe2\x80\x94if it could be called that\xe2\x80\x94would inject ambiguity into many statutes indeed.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on statutory context is all the more puzzling since the context obviously favors petitioners.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe focus [of the Impact Aid statute] is upon LEAs, not upon the number of pupils.\xe2\x80\x9d  393 F.\xc2\xa03d 1158, 1172 (CA10 2004) (O\xe2\x80\x99Brien, J., dissenting), opinion vacated, 437 F.\xc2\xa03d 1289, 1290 (2006) (en banc) <em>(per curiam).</em>  In fact, the provisions at issue here make not the slightest mention of students.  That is both sensible and predictable, since the Impact Aid program\xe2\x80\x99s equalization formula is designed to address funding disparities between<em> LEAs</em>, not between<em> students</em>.  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(A) (referring to \xe2\x80\x9ca program of State aid [that] equalizes expenditures among local educational agencies\xe2\x80\x9d); see also \xc2\xa77709(d)(1).  Indeed, the whole point of the equalization determination is to figure out whether States may reduce state aid to <em>LEAs</em>.  See \xc2\xa77709(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the plain language of the Impact Aid statute compels the conclusion that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s method of calculation is ultra vires.  Employing the formula that the statute requires, New Mexico is not equalized.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0How then, if the text is so clear, are respondents managing to win this case?  The answer can only be the return of that miraculous redeemer of lost causes, <em>Church of the Holy Trinity</em>.  In order to contort the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language beyond recognition, the Court must believe Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent so crystalline, the spirit of its legislation so glowingly bright, that the statutory text should simply not be read to say what it says.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>ante.</em>  Justice Stevens is quite candid on the point: He is willing to contradict the text.  See <em>ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933 (concurring opinion).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  But Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 candor should not make his philosophy seem unassuming.  He maintains that it is \xe2\x80\x9ca correct performance of the judicial function\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9coverride a strict interpretation of the text\xe2\x80\x9d so long as policy-driven interpretation \xe2\x80\x9cis faithful to the intent of Congress.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1.  But once one departs from \xe2\x80\x9cstrict interpretation of the text\xe2\x80\x9d (by which Justice Stevens means the actual meaning of the text) fidelity to the intent of Congress is a chancy thing.  The only thing we know for certain both Houses of Congress (and the President, if he signed the legislation) agreed upon is the text.  Legislative history can never produce a \xe2\x80\x9cpellucidly clear\xe2\x80\x9d picture, <em>ante, </em>at 3 (Stevens, J., concurring), of what a law was \xe2\x80\x9cintended\xe2\x80\x9d to mean, for the simple reason that it is never voted upon\xe2\x80\x94or ordinarily even seen or heard\xe2\x80\x94by the \xe2\x80\x9cintending\xe2\x80\x9d lawgiving entity, which consists of both Houses of Congress and the President (if he did not veto the bill).  See U. S. Const., Art.\xc2\xa0I, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 7.  Thus, what judges believe Congress \xe2\x80\x9cmeant\xe2\x80\x9d (apart from the text) has a disturbing but entirely unsurprising tendency to be whatever judges think Congress <em>must </em>have meant, <em>i.e., should </em>have meant.  In <em>Church of the Holy Trinity</em>, every Justice on this Court disregarded the plain language of a statute that forbade the hiring of a clergyman from abroad because, after all (they thought), \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a Christian nation,\xe2\x80\x9d 143 U. S., at 471, so Congress could not have meant what it said.  Is there any reason to believe that those Justices were lacking that \xe2\x80\x9cintellectua[l] honest[y]\xe2\x80\x9d that Justice Stevens \xe2\x80\x9cpresume[s]\xe2\x80\x9d all our judges possess, <em>ante</em>, at 2?  Intellectual honesty does not exclude a blinding intellectual bias.  And even if it did, the system of judicial amendatory veto over texts duly adopted by Congress bears no resemblance to the system of lawmaking set forth in our Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens takes comfort in the fact that this is a case in which he \xe2\x80\x9ccannot imagine anyone accusing any Member of the Court of voting one way or the other because of that Justice\xe2\x80\x99s own policy preferences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  I can readily imagine it, given that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion begins with a lengthy description of why the system its judgment approves is the <em>better</em> one.  But even assuming that, in this rare case, the Justices\xe2\x80\x99 departure from the enacted law has nothing to do with their policy view that it is a bad law, nothing in Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 separate opinion limits his approach to such rarities.  Why should we suppose that in matters more likely to arouse the judicial libido\xe2\x80\x94voting rights, antidiscrimination laws, or environmental protection, to name only a few\xe2\x80\x94a judge in the School of Textual Subversion would not find it convenient (yea, <em>righteous!</em>) to assume that Congress <em>must </em>have meant, not what it said, but what he knows to be best?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Lest there be any confusion on the point, I must discuss briefly the two cases Justice Stevens puts forward, <em>ante, </em>at 1, as demonstrating this Court\xe2\x80\x99s recent endorsement of his unorthodox views.  They demonstrate just the opposite.  <em>Griffin</em> v. <em>Oceanic Contractors, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/564/index.html">458 U. S. 564</a> (1982), involved a maritime statute that required the master of a vessel to furnish unpaid wages to a seaman within a specified period after the seaman\xe2\x80\x99s discharge, and further provided that a master who failed to do so without sufficient cause \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98shall pay to the seaman a sum equal to two days\xe2\x80\x99 pay for each and every day during which payment is delayed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 570 (quoting 46 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7596 (1976 ed.)).  We explained that \xe2\x80\x9cCongress intended the statute to mean exactly what its plain language says,\xe2\x80\x9d 458 U. S., at 574, and held that the seaman was entitled to double wages for every day during which payment was delayed, even for the period in which he had obtained alternative employment.  The result was that the seaman would receive approximately $300,000 for his master\xe2\x80\x99s improper withholding of $412.50, <em>id.,</em> at 575, even though \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t [was] probably true that Congress did not precisely envision the grossness of the difference . . . between the actual wages withheld and the amount of the award required by the statute,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 576.  We suggested in dicta that there might be a \xe2\x80\x9crare cas[e]\xe2\x80\x9d in which the Court could relax its steadfastness to statutory text, <em>id.</em>, at 571, but if <em>Griffin</em> itself did not qualify, it is hard to imagine what would.  The principle Justice Stevens would ascribe to <em>Griffin</em> is in fact the one he advocated in dissent.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his is one of the cases in which the exercise of judgment dictates a departure from the literal text in order to be faithful to the legislative will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 586 (Stevens, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second case Justice Stevens relies upon, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ron Pair Enterprises, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/235/index.html">489 U. S. 235</a> (1989), is equally inapt.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion there (unlike the one here) explained that our analysis \xe2\x80\x9cmust begin . . . with the language of the statute itself,\xe2\x80\x9d and concluded that that was \xe2\x80\x9calso where the inquiry should end, for where . . . the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is plain, \xe2\x80\x98the sole function of the courts is to enforce it according to its terms.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 241 (quoting <em>Caminetti</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/242/470/index.html">242 U. S. 470</a>, 485 (1917)).  My \xe2\x80\x9cfifth vote\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Ron Pair</em> was thus only \xe2\x80\x9cdecisive,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 1 (Stevens, J., concurring), in reaffirming this Court\xe2\x80\x99s adherence to statutory text, decisively preventing it from falling off the precipice it plunges over today.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the Court and Justice Stevens, I do not believe that what we are sure the Legislature <em>meant</em> to say can trump what it <em>did</em> say.  Citizens arrange their affairs not on the basis of their legislators\xe2\x80\x99 unexpressed intent, but on the basis of the law as it is written and promulgated.  I think it terribly unfair to expect that the two rural school districts who are petitioners here should have pored over some 30 years of regulatory history to divine Congress\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d objective (and with it the \xe2\x80\x9creal\xe2\x80\x9d intent that a majority of Justices would find honest and true).  To be governed by legislated text rather than legislators\xe2\x80\x99 intentions is what it means to be \xe2\x80\x9ca Government of laws, not of men.\xe2\x80\x9d  And in the last analysis the opposite approach is no more beneficial to the governors than it is to the governed.  By \xe2\x80\x9cdepriving legislators of the assurance that ordinary terms, used in an ordinary context, will be given a predictable meaning,\xe2\x80\x9d we deprive Congress of \xe2\x80\x9ca sure means by which it may work the people\xe2\x80\x99s will.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chisom</em> v. <em>Roemer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/380/index.html">501 U. S. 380</a>, 417 (1991) (Scalia, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I do not purport to know what Congress thought it was doing when it amended the Impact Aid program in 1994.  But even indulging Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 erroneous premise that there exists a \xe2\x80\x9clegislative intent\xe2\x80\x9d separate and apart from the statutory text, <em>ante</em>, at 1 (concurring opinion), I do not see how the Court can possibly say, with any measure of confidence, that Congress wished one thing rather than another.  There is ample evidence, for example, that at the time it amended the Impact Aid statute, Congress knew exactly how to incorporate student population into a disparity calculation.  Most prominently, in the <em>very same</em> Act that added \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) to the Impact Aid program, Congress established the Education Finance Incentive Program, known as EFIG.  See Improving America\xe2\x80\x99s Schools Act of 1994, 108 Stat. 3575.  That statute allocates grants to States based in part on an \xe2\x80\x9cequity factor\xe2\x80\x9d which requires a disparity calculation similar to that in the Impact Aid statute.  See 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa76337(b)(1)(A) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  In EFIG, however, Congress specifically required the Secretary to take student population into account: \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Secretary shall weigh the variation between per-pupil expenditures in each local educational agency . . . <em>according to the number of pupils served by the local educational agency</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa76337(b)(3)(A)(ii)(II) (emphasis added); see also Brief for Federal Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9329.  And there is more.  In EFIG, Congress <em>expressly provided</em> that a State would be accorded a favorable \xe2\x80\x9cequity factor\xe2\x80\x9d rating if it was considered equalized under the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Impact Aid regulations</em>.  See \xc2\xa76337(b)(3)(B) (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Congress thus explicitly incorporated the Impact Aid regulations into EFIG, but did no such thing with respect to the Impact Aid statute itself.  All this on the very same day.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor do I see any significance in the fact that no legislator in 1994 expressed the view that \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i) was designed to upend the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s equalization formula.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (majority opinion).  It is quite plausible\xe2\x80\x94indeed, eminently plausible\xe2\x80\x94that the Members of Congress took the plain meaning of the language <em>which the Secretary himself had proposed </em>to be what the Secretary himself had previously been doing.  It is bad enough for this Court to consider legislative materials beyond the statutory text in aid of resolving ambiguity, but it is truly unreasonable to <em>require</em> such extratextual evidence as a precondition for enforcing an <em>unambiguous</em> congressional mandate.  See <em>Koons Buick Pontiac GMC, Inc.</em> v. <em>Nigh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/50/index.html">543 U. S. 50</a>, 73\xe2\x80\x9374 (2004) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The Court points to the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cno Member of Congress has ever criticized the method the [Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s] regulation[s] sets forth.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  But can it really be that this case turns, in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, on whether a freshman Congressman from New Mexico gave a floor speech that only late-night C\xe2\x80\x93SPAN junkies would witness?  The only fair inference from Congress\xe2\x80\x99s silence is that Congress had nothing further to say, its statutory text doing all of the talking.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the Court expresses its belief that Congress must have intended to adopt the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s pre-1994 disparity test because that test is the more reasonable one, better able to account for States with small numbers of large LEAs, or large numbers of small ones.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  This, to tell the truth, is the core of the opinion.  As I have suggested, it is no accident that the countertextual legislative intent judges perceive <em>invariably</em> accords with what judges think best.  It seems to me, however, that this Court is no more capable of saying with certainty what is best in this area than it is of saying with certainty (apart from the text) what Congress intended.  There is good reason to be concerned\xe2\x80\x94in the implementation of a statute that makes a limited exception for States that have \xe2\x80\x9cin effect a program of State aid that equalizes expenditures for free public education <em>among local educational agencies</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 20 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77709(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV) (emphasis added)\xe2\x80\x94that the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s methodology eliminates from the disparity calculation <em>too many LEAs</em>.  In the certification at issue in this very case, the Secretary excluded 23 of New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s 89 LEAs, approximately 26%.  Is this Court such an expert in school finance that it can affirm the desirability of excluding one in four of New Mexico\xe2\x80\x99s LEAs from consideration?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Secretary\xe2\x80\x99s concerns about the discrepancy between large and small LEAs, does the Court have any basis for its apparent confidence that other parts of the Impact Aid statute do not adequately address the problem?  Immediately after setting forth the 95th and 5th percentile cutoffs, \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i), the statute instructs the Secretary to \xe2\x80\x9ctake into account the extent to which a program of State aid reflects the additional cost of providing free public education in particular types of local educational agencies, such as those that are geographically isolated, or to particular types of students, such as children with disabilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(ii).  Respondents do not explain why the Secretary could not use \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(ii) to temper any unintended effects of \xc2\xa77709(b)(2)(B)(i).  Respondents further maintain that States could take advantage of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s plain meaning by subdividing their LEAs.  But again, the statute itself contains a remedy.  Under \xc2\xa77713(9)(B)(ii), \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he term \xe2\x80\x98local educational agency\xe2\x80\x99 does not include any agency or school authority that the Secretary determines on a case-by-case basis . . . is not constituted or reconstituted for legitimate educational purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only sure indication of what Congress intended is what Congress enacted; and even if there is a difference between the two, the rule of law demands that the latter prevail.  This case will live with <em>Church of the Holy Trinity </em>as an exemplar of judicial disregard of crystal-clear text.  We must interpret the law as Congress has written it, not as we would wish it to be.  I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion has replaced the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98local educational agencies\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98local school districts.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 19.  While I have no objection to that terminology, I will instead use \xe2\x80\x9clocal educational agencies\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cLEAs.\xe2\x80\x9d </p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court maintains that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues\xe2\x80\x9d may also be attributed to schools or grade levels.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  Standing alone and abstracted from the rest of the statute, indeed it may.  But not when it appears in the phrase \xe2\x80\x9c<em>local educational agencies</em> with <em>per-pupil expenditures or revenues</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d (Emphasis added.)  In any case, the fact that \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditures or revenues\xe2\x80\x9d <em>could </em>be applied to composite entities other than LEAs does not establish that speaking of the \xe2\x80\x9cper-pupil expenditure or revenue\xe2\x80\x9d of an individual student makes any sense (it does not).</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Like Justice Stevens, respondents themselves were aboveboard when they litigated this case at the administrative level.  After hearing argument from the Department of Education, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) protested: \xe2\x80\x9cThe problem is I don\xe2\x80\x99t see the ambiguity of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 29.  To this the Department\xe2\x80\x99s counsel responded: \xe2\x80\x9cThe only way I can do that is by reference to the statutory purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Later in the hearing, the ALJ similarly asked the State of New Mexico how its interpretation was consistent with the statute.  The State answered: \xe2\x80\x9cLiterally, on the face of the words, perhaps not, probably not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 53.  Despite his misgivings, the ALJ ultimately decided that he did not possess the authority to invalidate the regulations.
