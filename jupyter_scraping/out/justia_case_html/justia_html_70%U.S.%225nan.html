The vessel agent at Chicago, one Goodenow, who filled the blanks in the Convoy\'s bills of lading and made the entries on the margin, testified to a similar effect, he swearing, moreover, that the expression, "<em>via</em> Welland Railway," entered on the margin, was construed by him as having the same meaning as "<em>care of</em> the Welland Railway."</p>\n<p>The <em>Convoy</em> having arrived at Port Colbourne on the 29th of August, 1860, the master reported her to the Welland Railway Company and informed the agents having charge of the railway and the elevator there that he was ready to discharge his cargo.  There were then thirteen vessels in the port with cargoes to discharge, which had arrived before the <em>Convoy,</em> and the agents replied that they would discharge the <em>Convoy\'s</em> cargo in its turn.  The master made a similar application on the morning of the 30th of August, and received answer as on the morning previous.  There being no elevator but the one at Port Colbourne and no warehouse or place where the wheat could be stored, the <em>Convoy</em> left Port Colbourne on the 30th of August and went to the City of <em>Buffalo, the nearest port to Port Colbourne.</em>  On the 31st of August, she discharged her cargo in <em>that city,</em> and the master stored it at the Hatch elevator there, taking a receipt for its delivery to his order.

The circuit court affirmed its decree.  Appeal here. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="230">Page 70 U. S. 230</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE MILLER delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>It is not necessary to determine whether the libellant in this case, who was owner of the ship, contracted to deliver the wheat to the consignees at Oswego or whether he contracted to deliver it at Port Colbourne.  The bill of lading given by the master of the vessel shows that it was understood that from Chicago to Port Colbourne was only part of the voyage which the wheat was to make, and that from Port Colbourne it was to be forwarded by the Welland Railway on its further voyage.</p>\n<p>The testimony is clear that at Port Colbourne there is an elevator belonging to that railroad company, and that it is the only one and that there is no other warehouse or receptacle in which the wheat could be stored.  The course of the trade demands that wheat shipped to Port Colbourne must go through that elevator, and if the vessels making delivery are so numerous that it cannot relieve them promptly, they must await their turn.  The master of the vessel must be held to have made his contract with a full knowledge of this course of trade, and be governed by it.  He had, therefore, no right, when he found there would be a delay of several days in delivering his cargo at the elevator, to carry it to Buffalo at the expense of the owner.</p>\n<p>There is another matter in which the master failed in his duty.  There was a telegraphic line in operation between Port Colbourne and Oswego, where the consignees resided, and he could, at any time during the three days he lay at Port Colbourne, have notified them of his difficulty, and received their instructions.  He did nothing of the kind, but, after waiting about half the time that would have been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="231">Page 70 U. S. 231</a></p><p> required to enable him to discharge his cargo, he sailed to Buffalo, deposited the wheat there, subject to his own order, and then notified consignees by telegraph that he should libel it for freight and damage unless paid immediately.</p>\n<p><em>Decree affirmed with costs.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
