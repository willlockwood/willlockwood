The prisoner, mistaking a corps of American troops for British, went over to them.

Malin <a href="/cases/federal/us/1/33/case.html">1 U.S. 33</a> (1778) </p><p>could be given of a man\'s sentiments; but that the intention expressed by any words offered in evidence, must relate immediately to the overt act laid and proved on the indictment; that although an adherence to the British troops was treason, yet, an adherence to American troops, even under a supposition that they were British, did not amount to that crime; and that the opinion, that words joined with actions made treason, however ingeniously supported, failed in point of law. See 3 Cro. 332. </p><p> The Attorney General, on the other hand, admitted that words alone do not amount to treason; but, he insisted, that they were proper evidence to explain the Defendant\'s actions on a trial for that crime. 1 Hawk 39.

Cro. C. 247. 4 Bl. C. 301. 3 Inst. 48. 49. 80. And that the circumstance of merely joining the enemy\'s army, being neither treason, nor misprision of treason, unless done with a traiterous intention, no overt act had been proved in chester, which was a prerequisite to any evidence being heard of an overt act committed in any other county. To evince that this was, likewise, the sense of the legislature, the Defendant\'s counsel read the act of Assembly giving the Supreme Court a special power to try offenders in Lancaster, for crimes committed in the counties of Chester and Philadelphia. </p><p> The Attorney General answered, that when an overt act is proved in the county where the trial is held, corroborative evidence may be given of overt acts committed in any other county. Fost. 9. 2 Hawk. 436. And that having established the prisoner\'s presence with the British army, nothing, but the proof of actual force, and its continuance, could excuse him from the charge of adhering to the enemies of the Commonwealth.
