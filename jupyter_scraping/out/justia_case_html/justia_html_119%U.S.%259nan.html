The prayer of the bill was</p>\n<p>"that the defendant may be compelled to account for all sums received under the said deed of trust, and that he may be decreed to hold all land purchased by him in trust for the plaintiff, and that he be decreed to convey to plaintiff his just proportion thereof, and for such other and further relief as may be necessary, and costs of suit."</p>\n<p>The answer admitted the execution and delivery of the deed; denied that any amount due Patterson, Wilson, Crittenden, and Felton, or either of them, was included in the $446,849; denied that defendant was a trustee for either of them; denied entry into any except a portion of the property, and averred that the rest was held adversely; admitted suit, judgment, and sale, and that defendant had become a purchaser of a portion, but not of all the tracts alleged in complaint; denied knowledge of the assignments to plaintiff; admitted demand for account and refusal, and then made the following averment:</p>\n<p>"When the trust deed was drawn, the said sum of forty nine thousand dollars was included in the sum secured by said trust deed, which was to be paid only after this defendant should be reimbursed the whole amount due and to become due him for the principal then due at the date of the trust deed, with the interest thereon and all subsequent advances and expenses with the interest thereon, and the said forty nine thousand dollars was not agreed by anyone to be paid in any other way or in any other event, and it was because of this arrangement that, while it was provided in the said trust deed, in the fifth </p><p><a class="page-number" name="262">Page 119 U.

And afterwards, on or about the 27th day of September, 1871, the said John B.

JUSTICE HARLAN delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The amount secured to be paid by the deed of trust executed on the first day of October, 1870, by Juana M. Estudillo and others to Theodore Le Roy, was $446,849 in gold coin of the United States.  Whether that sum included the $49,000 which is alleged to be due to Patterson, Wilson, Crittenden, and Felton, for legal services rendered cannot be determined by anything in the deed itself.  The plaintiff, who sues as assignee of the claims of said attorneys, is compelled to resort to parol evidence to show that the parties to the deed intended to provide for the payment of the $49,000 out of the proceeds of the sale of the trust property, and, to that end, included it in the aggregate of $446,849.  If that evidence was competent, it was the right of the defendant to show by parol evidence that the intention of the parties was to apply the proceeds of sale to the reimbursement of Le Roy for all advances and payments made and expenses incurred by him before anything was paid on the claims of the attorneys.  Looking at all the evidence, we are satisfied that these propositions are sustained, namely:  1. that the $49,000 was embraced in the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="265">Page 119 U. S. 265</a></p><p> $446,849, 2. the former sum was not to be paid until Le Roy was reimbursed the entire amount due and to become due to him on account of principal, interest, advances, and expenses.  That the sales of the trust property fell short of meeting these latter demands by a large amount is clearly established by the record of the suit in which the accounts of the trustee were audited and settled, and by other evidence in this cause.</p>\n<p>Upon the whole case, we think the decree was right, and it is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
