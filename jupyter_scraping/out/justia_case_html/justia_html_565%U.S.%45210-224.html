The Department of Agriculture\xe2\x80\x99s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), which administers the FMIA, has issued extensive regulations to govern the inspection of animals and meat, as well as other aspects of slaughterhouses\xe2\x80\x99 operations and facilities.  See 9 CFR \xc2\xa7300.1 et\xc2\xa0seq.  The FSIS inspection procedure begins with an \xe2\x80\x9cante-mortem\xe2\x80\x9d inspection of each animal brought to a slaughterhouse.  If, at that inspection, a nonambulatory animal is found to suffer from a particularly severe disease or condition, it must be classified as \xe2\x80\x9cU.\xc2\xa0S. Condemned\xe2\x80\x9d and killed apart from the slaughtering facilities where food is produced.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7309.3, 311.1 et seq.  Nonambulatory animals that are not condemned are classified as \xe2\x80\x9cU.\xc2\xa0S. Suspect.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7309.2(b).  They are set apart, specially monitored, and \xe2\x80\x9cslaughtered separately from other livestock.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7309.2(n).  Following slaughter, an inspector decides at a \xe2\x80\x9cpost-mortem\xe2\x80\x9d examination which parts, if any, of the suspect animal\xe2\x80\x99s carcass may be processed into food for humans. See 9 CFR pts. 310, 311.  FSIS regulations additionally prescribe methods for handling animals humanely at all stages of the slaughtering process, 9 CFR pt. 313, including specific provisions for the humane treatment of nonambulatory animals, 9 CFR 313.2(d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause, \xc2\xa7678, precludes states from imposing requirements that are \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope\xe2\x80\x9d of the FMIA, relate to slaughterhouse \xe2\x80\x9cpremises, facilities and operations,\xe2\x80\x9d and are \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to, or different than those made under\xe2\x80\x9d the FMIA.  In 2008, California amended its penal code to provide that no slaughterhouse shall \xe2\x80\x9cbuy, sell, or receive a nonambulatory animal\xe2\x80\x9d; \xe2\x80\x9cprocess, butcher, or sell meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human  consumption\xe2\x80\x9d; or \xe2\x80\x9chold a nonambulatory animal without taking immediate action to humanely euthanize the animal.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7599f(a)\xe2\x80\x93(c).  Petitioner National Meat Association (NMA), a trade association representing meatpackers and processors, sued to enjoin enforcement of \xc2\xa7599f against swine slaughterhouses, arguing that the FMIA preempts application of the state law.  The District Court agreed, and granted the NMA a preliminary injunction.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that \xc2\xa7599f is not preempted because it regulates only \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of animal that may be slaughtered,\xe2\x80\x9d not the inspection or slaughtering process itself. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0The FMIA expressly preempts \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s application against federally inspected swine slaughterhouses.  Pp. 6\xe2\x88\x9214.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0The FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause sweeps widely, and so blocks the applications of \xc2\xa7599f challenged here.  The clause prevents a State from imposing any additional or different\xe2\x80\x95even if nonconflicting\xe2\x80\x95requirements that fall within the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope and concern slaughterhouse facilities or operations.  Section 599f imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses:  Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.  For example, when a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to a slaughterhouse, \xc2\xa7599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the pig without immediately euthanizing it; and \xc2\xa7599f(b) prohibits the slaughterhouse from \xe2\x80\x9cprocess[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbutcher[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the animal to make food.  By contrast, the FMIA and its regulations allow a slaughterhouse to hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory animal that has not been condemned, and to process and butcher such an animal\xe2\x80\x99s meat, subject to an FSIS official\xe2\x80\x99s approval at post-mortem inspection.  Similarly, when a pig is nonambulatory at the time of delivery, \xc2\xa7599f(a) prohibits a slaughterhouse from \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbuy[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d the pig.  But the FMIA and its regulations expressly allow slaughterhouses to purchase nonambulatory pigs. See \n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7644; 9 CFR \xc2\xa7325.20(c).  And the FSIS inspection regime clearly contemplates that slaughterhouses will receive nonambulatory animals.  So \xc2\xa7599f substitutes a new regulatory regime for the one the FMIA prescribes. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent Humane Society argues that \xc2\xa7599f(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on purchasing nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because it would not be preempted if applied to purchases occurring off slaughterhouse premises.  But the record does not disclose whether \xc2\xa7599f(a) ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s operations.  Moreover, even if the State could regulate off-site purchases, it does not follow that on-site purchases would escape preemption, because the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause expressly focuses on slaughterhouse \xe2\x80\x9cpremises, facilities and operations.\xe2\x80\x9d  And while the Humane Society is correct that the FMIA does not normally regulate slaughterhouse sales activities, \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s sales ban serves to regulate how slaughterhouses must handle nonambulatory pigs on their premises.  Its effect is to make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process.  It is therefore preempted by the FMIA.  Pp. 6\xe2\x88\x9210.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0Also rejected is the broad argument that \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s challenged provisions fall outside the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process, while the FMIA extends only to \xe2\x80\x9canimals that are going to be turned into meat.\xe2\x80\x9d  In fact, the FMIA regulates animals on slaughterhouse premises that will never be turned into meat. For example, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process, e.g., swine with hog cholera, 9 CFR \xc2\xa7309.5(a).  The argument that \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion avoids the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope because it is designed to ensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than meat safety, misunderstands the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  The FMIA addresses not just food safety, but humane treatment, as well.  See, e.g., 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7603, 610(b).

According to that court, the FMIA does not expressly preempt \xc2\xa7599f because the state law regulates only \xe2\x80\x9cthe kind of animal that may be slaughtered,\xe2\x80\x9d and not the inspection or slaughtering process itself.  599 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1098.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe granted certiorari, 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. __ (2011), and now reverse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause sweeps widely\xe2\x80\x94and in so doing, blocks the applications of \xc2\xa7599f challenged here.  The clause prevents a State from imposing any additional or different\xe2\x80\x94even if non-conflicting\xe2\x80\x94requirements that fall within the scope of the Act and concern a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s facilities or operations.  And at every turn \xc2\xa7599f imposes additional or different requirements on swine slaughterhouses: It compels them to deal with nonambulatory pigs on their premises in ways that the federal Act and regulations do not.  In essence, California\xe2\x80\x99s statute substitutes a new regulatory scheme for the one the FSIS uses.  Where under federal law a slaughterhouse may take one course of action in handling a nonambulatory pig, under state law the slaughterhouse must take another.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tConsider first what the two statutes tell a slaughterhouse to do when (as not infrequently occurs) a pig becomes injured and thus nonambulatory sometime after delivery to the slaughterhouse.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Section 599f(c) prohibits the slaughterhouse from \xe2\x80\x9chold[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d such an animal \xe2\x80\x9cwithout taking immediate action to humanely euthanize\xe2\x80\x9d it.  And \xc2\xa7599f(b) provides that no part of the animal\xe2\x80\x99s carcass may be \xe2\x80\x9cprocess[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbutcher[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d to make food.  By contrast, under the FMIA and its regulations, a slaughterhouse may hold (without euthanizing) any nonambulatory pig that has not been condemned.  See supra, at 3.  And the slaughterhouse may process or butcher such an animal\xe2\x80\x99s meat for human consumption, subject to an FSIS official\xe2\x80\x99s approval at a post-mortem inspection.  See ibid.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s proscriptions thus exceed the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s.  To be sure, nothing in the federal Act requires what the state law forbids (or forbids what the state law requires); California is right to note that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he FMIA does not mandate that \xe2\x80\x98U. S. Suspect\xe2\x80\x99 [nonambulatory] animals .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. be placed into the human food production process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for State Respondents 31.  But that is irrelevant, because the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause covers not just conflicting, but also different or additional state requirements.  It therefore precludes California\xe2\x80\x99s effort in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7599f(b) and (c) to im-pose new rules, beyond any the FSIS has chosen to adopt, on what a slaughterhouse must do with a pig that be-comes nonambulatory during the production process.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSimilarly, consider how the state and federal laws address what a slaughterhouse should do when a pig is non-ambulatory at the time of delivery, usually because of harsh transportation conditions.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Section 599f(a) of the California law bars a slaughterhouse from \xe2\x80\x9creceiv[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cbuy[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d such a pig, thus obligating the slaughterhouse to refuse delivery of the animal.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But that directive, too, deviates from any imposed by federal law.  A regulation issued under the FMIA specifically authorizes slaughterhouses to buy disabled or diseased animals (including nonambulatory swine), by exempting them from a general prohibition on such purchases.  See 9 CFR \xc2\xa7325.20(c).  And other regulations contemplate that slaughterhouses will in fact take, rather than refuse, receipt of nonambulatory swine.  Recall that the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations provide for the inspection of all pigs at delivery, see supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x94in the case of nonambulatory pigs, often right on the truck, see Humane Handling and Slaughter of Livestock, FSIS Directive 6900.2, ch. II(I).  They further instruct slaughterhouses to kill and dispose of any nonambulatory pigs labeled \xe2\x80\x9ccondemned,\xe2\x80\x9d and to slaughter separately those marked \xe2\x80\x9csuspect.\xe2\x80\x9d   See supra, at 3.  In short, federal law establishes rules for handling and slaughtering nonam-bulatory pigs brought to a slaughterhouse, rather than ordering them returned to sender.  So \xc2\xa7599f(a) and the FMIA require different things of a slaughterhouse confronted with a delivery truck containing nonambula- tory swine.  The former says \xe2\x80\x9cdo not receive or buy them\xe2\x80\x9d; the latter does not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Humane Society counters that at least \xc2\xa7599f(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on buying nonambulatory animals escapes preemption because that provision applies no matter when or where a purchase takes place.  The argument proceeds in three steps: (1) \xc2\xa7599f(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban covers purchases of non-ambulatory pigs made prior to delivery, away from the slaughterhouse itself (say, at a farm or auction); (2) the State may regulate such offsite purchases because they do not involve a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpremises, facilities and operations,\xe2\x80\x9d which is a condition of preemption under the FMIA; and (3) no different result should obtain just because a slaughterhouse structures its swine purchases to occur at delivery, on its own property.  See Brief for Non-State Respondents 43\xe2\x80\x9345.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut this argument fails on two grounds.  First, its preliminary steps have no foundation in the record.  Until a stray comment at oral argument, see Tr. of Oral Arg. 50, neither the State nor the Humane Society had disputed the NMA\xe2\x80\x99s assertion that slaughterhouses buy pigs at delivery (or still later, upon successful ante-mortem inspection).  See Brief for Petitioner 46, n.\xc2\xa018; Brief for Non-State Respondents 44; Brief for State Respondents 16, n.\xc2\xa05.  Nor had the parties presented evidence that a significant number of pigs become nonambulatory before shipment, when any offsite purchases would occur.  The record therefore does not disclose whether \xc2\xa7599f(a)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on purchase ever applies beyond the slaughterhouse gate, much less how an application of that kind would affect a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s operations.  And because that is so, we have no basis for deciding whether the FMIA would preempt it.  Second, even assuming that a State could regulate offsite purchases, the concluding step of the Humane Society\xe2\x80\x99s argument would not follow.  The FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause expressly focuses on \xe2\x80\x9cpremises, facilities and operations\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94at bottom, the slaughtering and processing of animals at a given location.  So the distinction between a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s site-based activities and its more far-flung commercial dealings is not, as the Humane Society contends, an anomaly that courts should strain to avoid.  It is instead a fundamental feature of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor that reason, the Humane Society\xe2\x80\x99s stronger argument concerns California\xe2\x80\x99s effort to regulate the last stage of a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s business\xe2\x80\x94the ban in \xc2\xa7599f(b) on \xe2\x80\x9csell[ing] meat or products of nonambulatory animals for human consumption.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Government acknowledges that the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause does not usually foreclose \xe2\x80\x9cstate regulation of the commercial sales activities of slaughterhouses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 17.  And the Humane Society asserts, in line with that general rule, that \xc2\xa7599f(b)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on sales does not regulate a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d because it kicks in only after they have ended: Once meat from a slaughtered pig has passed a post-mortem inspection, the Act \xe2\x80\x9cis not concerned with whether or how it is ever actually sold.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Non-State Respondents 45.  At most, the Humane Society claims, \xc2\xa7599f(b)\xe2\x80\x99s ban on sales offers an \xe2\x80\x9cincentiv[e]\xe2\x80\x9d to a slaughterhouse to take nonambulatory pigs out of the meat production process.  Id., at 46.  And California may so \xe2\x80\x9cmotivate[]\xe2\x80\x9d an operational choice without running afoul of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision.  Ibid. (quoting Bates v. Dow Agrosciences LLC, \n\n544 U.\xc2\xa0S. 431, \n443 (2005)\n).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut this argument mistakes how the prohibition on sales operates within \xc2\xa7599f as a whole.  The sales ban is a criminal proscription calculated to help implement and enforce each of the section\xe2\x80\x99s other regulations\xe2\x80\x94its prohibition of receipt and purchase, its bar on butchering and processing, and its mandate of immediate euthanasia.  The idea\xe2\x80\x94and the inevitable effect\xe2\x80\x94of the provision is to make sure that slaughterhouses remove nonambulatory pigs from the production process (or keep them out of the process from the beginning) by criminalizing the sale of their meat.  That, we think, is something more than an \xe2\x80\x9cincentive\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cmotivat[or]\xe2\x80\x9d; the sales ban instead functions as a command to slaughterhouses to structure their operations in the exact way the remainder of \xc2\xa7599f mandates.  And indeed, if the sales ban were to avoid the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause, then any State could impose any regulation on slaughterhouses just by framing it as a ban on the sale of meat produced in whatever way the State disapproved.  That would make a mockery of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision.  Cf. Engine Mfrs. Assn. v. South Coast Air Quality Management Dist., \n\n541 U.\xc2\xa0S. 246, \n255 (2004)\n (stating that it \xe2\x80\x9cwould make no sense\xe2\x80\x9d to allow state regulations to escape preemption because they addressed the purchase, rather than manufacture, of a federally regulated product).  Like the rest of \xc2\xa7599f, the sales ban regulates how slaughterhouses must deal with non-ambulatory pigs on their premises.  The FMIA therefore preempts it for all the same reasons.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCalifornia\xe2\x80\x99s and the Humane Society\xe2\x80\x99s broadest argument against preemption maintains that all of \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s challenged provisions fall outside the \xe2\x80\x9cscope\xe2\x80\x9d of the FMIA because they exclude a class of animals from the slaughtering process.  See \n21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7678 (preempting certain requirements \xe2\x80\x9cwithin the scope of this [Act]\xe2\x80\x9d).  According to this view, the Act (and the FSIS\xe2\x80\x99s authority under it) extends only to \xe2\x80\x9canimals that are going to be turned into meat,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. of Oral Arg. 28\xe2\x80\x94or to use another phrase, animals that will \xe2\x80\x9cbe slaughtered .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for purposes of human food production,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for State Respondents 19 (emphasis deleted).  Section 599f avoids the scope of the Act, respondents claim, by altogether removing nonambulatory pigs from the slaughtering process.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The Ninth Circuit accepted this argument, analogizing \xc2\xa7599f to state laws upheld in two other Circuits banning the slaughter of horses for human consumption.  599 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1098 (discussing Cavel Int\xe2\x80\x99l., Inc. v.

The FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope includes not only \xe2\x80\x9canimals that are going to be turned into meat,\xe2\x80\x9d but animals on a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s premises that will never suffer that fate.  The Act\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations themselves exclude many classes of animals from the slaughtering process.  Swine with hog cholera, for example, are disqualified, see 9 CFR \xc2\xa7309.5(a); so too are swine and other livestock \xe2\x80\x9caffected with anthrax,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7309.7(a).  Indeed, the federal regulations prohibit the slaughter of any nonambulatory cattle for human consumption.  See \xc2\xa7309.3(e).  As these examples demonstrate, one vital function of the Act and its regulations is to ensure that some kinds of livestock delivered to a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s gates will not be turned into meat.  Under federal law, nonambulatory pigs are not among those excluded animals.  But that is to say only that \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s requirements differ from those of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x94not that \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s requirements fall outside the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor are respondents right to suggest that \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s exclusion avoids the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope because it is designed to ensure the humane treatment of pigs, rather than the safety of meat.  See, e.g., Brief for State Respondents 29; Brief for Non-State Respondents 39\xe2\x80\x9340.  That view misunderstands the authority\xe2\x80\x94and indeed responsibility\xe2\x80\x94that the FMIA gives to federal officials.  Since 1978, when Congress incorporated the HMSA\xe2\x80\x99s standards, the FMIA has required slaughterhouses to follow prescribed methods of humane handling, so as to minimize animals\xe2\x80\x99 pain and suffering.  See 21 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7603(b), 610(b); supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x934.  A violation of those standards is a crime, see \xc2\xa7676, and the Secretary of Agriculture can suspend inspections at\xe2\x80\x94and thus effectively shut down\xe2\x80\x94a slaughterhouse that dis-obeys them, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7603(b), 610(c).  To implement the Act\xe2\x80\x99s humane-handling provisions, the FSIS has issued detailed regulations, see 9 CFR pt. 313, including some specifically addressing animals that cannot walk, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7313.2(d), 313.1(c).  Those rules, as earlier noted, apply throughout the time an animal is on a slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s premises, from the moment a delivery truck pulls up to the gate.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  So the FMIA addresses not just food safety, but humane treatment as well.  Even California conceded at oral argument that the FSIS could issue regulations under the FMIA, similar to \xc2\xa7599f, mandating the euthanasia of nonambulatory swine.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 46\xe2\x80\x9347.  If that is so\xe2\x80\x94and it is, because of the FSIS\xe2\x80\x99s authority over humane-handling methods\xe2\x80\x94then \xc2\xa7599f\xe2\x80\x99s requirements must fall within the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Circuit decisions upholding state bans on slaughtering horses, on which the Ninth Circuit relied, do not demand any different conclusion.  We express no view on those decisions, except to say that the laws sustained there differ from \xc2\xa7599f in a significant respect.  A ban on butchering horses for human consumption works at a remove from the sites and activities that the FMIA most directly governs.  When such a ban is in effect, no horses will be delivered to, inspected at, or handled by a slaughterhouse, because no horses will be ordered for purchase in the first instance.  But \xc2\xa7599f does not and cannot work in that way.  As earlier noted, many nonambulatory pigs become disabled either in transit to or after arrival at a slaughterhouse.  See supra, at 6\xe2\x80\x939, and nn. 5\xe2\x80\x936.  So even with \xc2\xa7599f in effect, a swine slaughterhouse will encounter nonambulatory pigs.  In that circumstance, \xc2\xa7599f tells the slaughterhouse what to do with those animals.  Unlike a horse slaughtering ban, the statute thus reaches into the slaughterhouse\xe2\x80\x99s facilities and affects its daily activities.  And in so doing, the California law runs smack into the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s regulations.  So whatever might be said of other bans on slaughter, \xc2\xa7599f imposes requirements within\xe2\x80\x94and indeed at the very heart of\xe2\x80\x94the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s scope.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe FMIA regulates slaughterhouses\xe2\x80\x99 handling and treatment of nonambulatory pigs from the moment of their delivery through the end of the meat production process.  California\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7599f endeavors to regulate the same thing, at the same time, in the same place\xe2\x80\x94except by imposing different requirements.  The FMIA expressly preempts such a state law.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit, and remand this case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The FMIA applies to all slaughterhouses producing meat for in-terstate and foreign commerce.

About 100 million pigs are slaughtered each year in the United States, see Dept. of Agriculture, National Agricultural Statistics Service, Livestock Slaughter 13 (Jan. 2011), so those percentages work out to between 100,000 and 1,000,000 pigs.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">6</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0According to one estimate, almost half of one percent of the pigs slaughtered annually in the United States become nonambulatory during the trip from farm to slaughterhouse.  See National Pork Board, Transport Quality Assurance Handbook 25 (Version 4, 2010).  About half that many die during transport.  See ibid.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">7</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Section 599f(a) also bans \xe2\x80\x9csell[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d nonambulatory animals.  But because slaughterhouses (unlike other entities referenced in the provision) do not typically sell live animals, that prohibition is not at issue in this case.  The statute\xe2\x80\x99s distinct ban on selling meat from nonambula-tory animals that have been slaughtered is discussed infra, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T8" name="F8">8</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s brief sometimes casts its argument in terms of the \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d language of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption clause (although the State appeared to abandon this phrasing at oral argument).  In this version of the claim, California contends that the \xe2\x80\x9coperations\xe2\x80\x9d of a slaughterhouse are only those \xe2\x80\x9cof federal concern,\xe2\x80\x9d and that excluding a class of animals from the slaughtering process does not impinge on such operations.  Brief for State Respondents 20, n.\xc2\xa09; see also id., at 20\xe2\x80\x9321.  We see no real difference between saying that a categorical exclusion of animals does not implicate \xe2\x80\x9coperations of federal concern\xe2\x80\x9d and saying that it does not fall within the scope of the Act.  Accordingly, our answer to both forms of the argument is the same.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T9" name="F9">9</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Indeed, the FSIS recently solicited comment on a rulemaking petition that would require all nonambulatory disabled livestock, including swine, to be humanely euthanized.  See 76 Fed. Reg. 6572 (2011).  The FSIS has taken no further action on that petition.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">10</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0We finally reject California\xe2\x80\x99s argument, see Brief for State Respondents 20, that our reading of the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s preemption provision renders its saving clause insignificant.  That clause provides that States may regulate slaughterhouses as to \xe2\x80\x9cother matters,\xe2\x80\x9d not addressed in the express preemption clause, as long as those laws are \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with\xe2\x80\x9d the FMIA.  \n.  So, for example, the Government acknowledges that state laws of general application (workplace safety regulations, building codes, etc.) will usually apply to slaughterhouses.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22.  Moreover, because the FMIA\xe2\x80\x99s express preemption provision prevents States from imposing only \xe2\x80\x9caddition[al]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent\xe2\x80\x9d requirements, \xc2\xa7678, States may exact civil or criminal penalties for animal cruelty or other conduct that also violates the FMIA.  See \xc2\xa7678; cf. Bates v. Dow Agrosciences, LLC, \n (holding that a preemption clause barring state laws \xe2\x80\x9cin addition to or different\xe2\x80\x9d from a federal Act does not interfere with an \xe2\x80\x9cequivalent\xe2\x80\x9d state provision).  Although the FMIA preempts much state law involving slaughterhouses, it thus leaves some room for the States to regulate.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
