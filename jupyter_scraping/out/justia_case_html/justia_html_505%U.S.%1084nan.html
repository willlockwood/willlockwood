In view of the Government\'s "personal use exception" policy, expressed in the Federal Drug Administration\'s February 1, 1989, revision of its Regulatory Procedures Manual, * the only legitimate governmental interest that is now relevant is the interest in avoiding any "significant health risk" associated with the use of this medication when prescribed by a competent physician. There is no evidence in this record that Benten faces any such risk; indeed, on the specific facts of this case, the Government\'s purported interest actually supports her position. In all events, I am persuaded that the relevant legitimate federal interest is not sufficient to justify the burdensome consequence of this seizure.</p><p>Accordingly, I would grant the application.</p><p>*The Regulatory Procedures Manual provides in pertinent part as follows:</p><p>"In deciding whether to exercise discretion to allow personal shipments of drugs or devices, FDA personnel should consider a more permissive policy in the following situations:</p><p>"when the intended use is appropriately identified, such use is not for treatment of a serious condition, and the product is not known to represent a significant health risk."
