Respondent Chevron U. S. A. Inc., then one of the largest oil companies in Hawaii, brought this suit seeking a declaration that the rent cap effected an unconstitutional taking of its property and an injunction against application of the cap to its stations.  Applying <em>Agins</em> v. <em>City of Tiburon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/index.html">447 U. S. 255</a>, 260\xe2\x80\x94where this Court declared that government regulation of private property \xe2\x80\x9ceffects a taking if [it] does not substantially advance legitimate state interests\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94the District Court held that the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not substantially advance Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in controlling retail gas prices.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em> <em>Agins\xe2\x80\x99</em> \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advance[s]\xe2\x80\x9d formula is not an appropriate test for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a) The paradigmatic taking requiring just compensation is a direct government appropriation or physical invasion of private property.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Pewee Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/341/114/index.html">341 U. S. 114</a>.  Beginning with <em>Pennsylvania Coal Co.</em> v. <em>Mahon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/260/393/index.html">260 U. S. 393</a>, however, the Court recognized that government regulation of private property may be so onerous that its effect is tantamount to a direct appropriation or ouster.  Regulatory actions generally will be deemed <em>per se</em> takings for Fifth Amendment purposes (1) where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property, see <em>Loretto</em> v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/index.html">458 U. S. 419</a>, or (2) where regulations completely deprive an owner of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> economically beneficial us[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of her property, <em>Lucas</em> v. <em>South Carolina Coastal Council</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/505/1003/index.html">505 U. S. 1003</a>, 1019.  Outside these two categories (and the special context of land-use exactions discussed below), regulatory takings challenges are governed by <em>Penn Central Transportation Co.</em> v. <em>New York City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/index.html">438 U. S. 104</a>, 124.  <em>Penn Central</em> identified several factors\xe2\x80\x94including the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s economic impact on the claimant, the extent to which it interferes with distinct investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government action\xe2\x80\x94that are particularly significant in determining whether a regulation effects a taking.  Because the three inquiries reflected in <em>Loretto</em>, <em>Lucas</em>, and <em>Penn Central</em> all aim to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to a direct appropriation of or ouster from private property, each of them focuses upon the severity of the burden<em> </em>that government imposes upon property rights.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b) The \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula is not a valid method of identifying compensable regulatory takings.  It prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process test, which has no proper place in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s takings jurisprudence.  The formula unquestionably was derived from due process precedents, since <em>Agins </em>supported it with citations to <em>Nectow</em> v. <em>Cambridge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/183/index.html">277 U. S. 183</a>, 185, and <em>Village of Euclid</em> v. <em>Ambler Realty Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/272/365/index.html">272 U. S. 365</a>, 395.  Although <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on those precedents is understandable when viewed in historical context, the language the Court selected was imprecise.  It suggests a means-ends test, asking, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is <em>effective</em> in achieving some legitimate public purpose.  Such an inquiry is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\xe2\x80\x9d for Fifth Amendment purposes.  In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry reveals nothing about the <em>magnitude or character of the burden </em>a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights or how any regulatory burden is <em>distributed</em> among property owners.  Thus, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.  Moreover, the <em>Agins </em>formula\xe2\x80\x99s application as a takings test would present serious practical difficulties.  Reading it to demand heightened means-ends review of virtually all regulation of private property would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulations\xe2\x80\x94a task for which they are not well suited.  It would also empower\xe2\x80\x94and might often require\xe2\x80\x94courts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies.  Pp. 10\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c) The Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding here does not require it to disturb any of its prior holdings.  Although it applied a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry in <em>Agins </em>itself, see 447 U. S., at 261\xe2\x80\x93262, and arguably in <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn.</em> v. <em>DeBenedictis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/470/index.html">480 U. S. 470</a>, 485\xe2\x80\x93492, it has never found a compensable taking based on such an inquiry.  Moreover, in most of the cases reciting the <em>Agins</em> formula, the Court has merely assumed its validity when referring to it in dicta.  See, <em>e.g., Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council, Inc.</em> v. <em>Tahoe Regional Planning Agency</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/302/index.html">535 U. S. 302</a>, 334.  Although <em>Nollan</em> v. <em>California Coastal Commission</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/825/index.html">483 U. S. 825</a>, 834, and <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>City of Tigard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/374/index.html">512 U. S. 374</a>, 385, drew upon <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 language, the rule those cases established is entirely distinct from the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d test: They involved a special application of the \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine of unconstitutional conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d which provides that the government may not require a person to give up the constitutional right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use in exchange for a discretionary benefit that has little or no relationship to the property.  <em>Ibid.</em> Pp. 16\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d) A plaintiff seeking to challenge a government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may proceed by alleging a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d taking, a <em>Lucas</em>-type total regulatory taking, a <em>Penn Central </em>taking, or a land-use exaction violating the <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan</em> standards.  Because Chevron argued only a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d theory, it was not entitled to summary judgment on its takings claim.

A quarter century ago, in <em>Agins</em> v. <em>City of Tiburon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/447/255/index.html">447 U. S. 255</a> (1980), the Court declared that government regulation of private property \xe2\x80\x9ceffects a taking if [such regulation] does not substantially advance legitimate state interests\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 260.  Through reiteration in a half dozen or so decisions since <em>Agins</em>, this language has been ensconced in our Fifth Amendment takings jurisprudence.  See <em>Monterey</em> v. <em>Del Monte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/687/index.html">526 U. S. 687</a>, 704 (1999) (citing cases).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the case before us, the lower courts applied <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula to strike down a Hawaii statute that limits the rent that oil companies may charge to dealers who lease service stations owned by the companies.  The lower courts held that the rent cap effects an uncompensated taking of private property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments because it does not substantially advance Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in controlling retail gasoline prices.  This case requires us to decide whether the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula announced in <em>Agins</em> is an appropriate test for determining whether a regulation effects a Fifth Amendment taking.  We conclude that it is not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State of Hawaii, whose territory comprises an archipelago of 132 islands clustered in the midst of the Pacific Ocean, is located over 1,600 miles from the U. S. mainland and ranks among the least populous of the 50 States.  Because of Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s small size and geographic isolation, its wholesale market for oil products is highly concentrated.  When this lawsuit began in 1997, only two refineries and six gasoline wholesalers were doing business in the State.  As of that time, respondent Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. was the largest refiner and marketer of gasoline in Hawaii: It controlled 60 percent of the market for gasoline produced or refined in-state and 30 percent of the wholesale market on the State\xe2\x80\x99s most populous island, Oahu.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Gasoline is sold at retail in Hawaii from about 300 different service stations.  About half of these stations are leased from oil companies by independent lessee-dealers, another 75 or so are owned and operated by \xe2\x80\x9copen\xe2\x80\x9d dealers, and the remainder are owned and operated by the oil companies.  Chevron sells most of its product through 64 independent lessee-dealer stations.  In a typical lessee-dealer arrangement, Chevron buys or leases land from a third party, builds a service station, and then leases the station to a dealer on a turnkey basis.  Chevron charges the lessee-dealer a monthly rent, defined as a percentage of the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s margin on retail sales of gasoline and other goods.  In addition, Chevron requires the lessee-dealer to enter into a supply contract, under which the dealer agrees to purchase from Chevron whatever is necessary to satisfy demand at the station for Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s product.  Chevron unilaterally sets the wholesale price of its product.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Hawaii Legislature enacted Act 257 in June 1997, apparently in response to concerns about the effects of market concentration on retail gasoline prices.  See 1997 Haw. Sess. Laws no. 257, \xc2\xa71.  The statute seeks to protect independent dealers by imposing certain restrictions on the ownership and leasing of service stations by oil companies.  It prohibits oil companies from converting existing lessee-dealer stations to company-operated stations and from locating new company-operated stations in close proximity to existing dealer-operated stations.  Haw. Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7486H\xe2\x80\x9310.4(a), (b) (1998 Cum. Supp.).  More importantly for present purposes, Act 257 limits the amount of rent that an oil company may charge a lessee-dealer to 15 percent of the dealer\xe2\x80\x99s gross profits from gasoline sales plus 15 percent of gross sales of products other than gasoline.  \xc2\xa7486H\xe2\x80\x9310.4(c).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thirty days after Act 257\xe2\x80\x99s enactment, Chevron sued the Governor and Attorney General of Hawaii in their official capacities (collectively Hawaii) in the United States District Court for the District of Hawaii, raising several federal constitutional challenges to the statute.  As pertinent here, Chevron claimed that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s rent cap provision, on its face, effected a taking of Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s property in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Chevron sought a declaration to this effect as well as an injunction against the application of the rent cap to its stations.  Chevron swiftly moved for summary judgment on its takings claim, arguing that the rent cap does not substantially advance any legitimate government interest.  Hawaii filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all of Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s claims.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To facilitate resolution of the summary judgment motions, the parties jointly stipulated to certain relevant facts.  They agreed that Act 257 reduces by about $207,000 per year the aggregate rent that Chevron would otherwise charge on 11 of its 64 lessee-dealer stations.  On the other hand, the statute allows Chevron to collect more rent than it would otherwise charge at its remaining 53 lessee-dealer stations, such that Chevron could increase its overall rental income from all 64 stations by nearly $1.1 million per year.  The parties further stipulated that, over the past 20 years, Chevron has not fully recovered the costs of maintaining lessee-dealer stations in any State through rent alone.  Rather, the company recoups its expenses through a combination of rent and product sales.  Finally, the joint stipulation states that Chevron has earned in the past, and anticipates that it will continue to earn under Act 257, a return on its investment in lessee-dealer stations in Hawaii that satisfies any constitutional standard.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment to Chevron, holding that \xe2\x80\x9cAct 257 fails to substantially advance a legitimate state interest, and as such, effects an unconstitutional taking in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Cayetano</em>, 57 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1003, 1014 (1998).  The District Court accepted Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the rent cap was intended to prevent concentration of the retail gasoline market\xe2\x80\x94and, more importantly, resultant high prices for consumers\xe2\x80\x94by maintaining the viability of independent lessee-dealers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1009\xe2\x80\x931010.  The court concluded that the statute would not substantially advance this interest, however, because it would not actually reduce lessee-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 costs or retail prices.  It found that the rent cap would allow incumbent lessee-dealers, upon transferring occupancy rights to a new lessee, to charge the incoming lessee a premium reflecting the value of the rent reduction.  Accordingly, the District Court reasoned, the incoming lessee\xe2\x80\x99s overall expenses would be the same as in the absence of the rent cap, so there would be no savings to pass along to consumers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1010\xe2\x80\x931012.  Nor would incumbent lessees benefit from the rent cap, the court found, because the oil company lessors would unilaterally raise wholesale fuel prices in order to offset the reduction in their rental income.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1012\xe2\x80\x931014.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the District Court had applied the correct legal standard to Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Cayetano</em>, 224 F.\xc2\xa03d 1030, 1033\xe2\x80\x931037 (2000).  The Court of Appeals vacated the grant of summary judgment, however, on the ground that a genuine issue of material fact remained as to whether the Act would benefit consumers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1037\xe2\x80\x931042.  Judge William Fletcher concurred in the judgment, maintaining that the \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard applicable to \xe2\x80\x9cordinary rent and price control laws\xe2\x80\x9d should instead govern Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1048.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On remand, the District Court entered judgment for Chevron after a 1-day bench trial in which Chevron and Hawaii called competing expert witnesses (both economists) to testify.  198 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1182 (2002).  Finding Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s expert witness to be \xe2\x80\x9cmore persuasive\xe2\x80\x9d than the State\xe2\x80\x99s expert, the District Court once again concluded that oil companies would raise wholesale gasoline prices to offset any rent reduction required by Act 257, and that the result would be an increase in retail gasoline prices.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1187\xe2\x80\x931189.  Even if the rent cap did reduce lessee-dealers\xe2\x80\x99 costs, the court found, they would not pass on any savings to consumers.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1189.  The court went on to reiterate its determination that Act 257 would enable incumbent lessee-dealers to sell their leaseholds at a premium, such that incoming lessees would not obtain any of the benefits of the rent cap.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1189\xe2\x80\x931190.  And while it acknowledged that the rent cap could preclude oil companies from constructively evicting dealers through excessive rents, the court found no evidence that Chevron or any other oil company would attempt to charge such rents in the absence of the cap.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1191.  Finally, the court concluded that Act 257 would in fact decrease the number of lessee-dealer stations because the rent cap would discourage oil companies from building such stations.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1191\xe2\x80\x931192.  Based on these findings, the District Court held that \xe2\x80\x9cAct 257 effect[ed] an unconstitutional regulatory taking given its failure to substantially advance any legitimate state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1193.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding that its decision in the prior appeal barred Hawaii from challenging the application of the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d test to Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim or from arguing for a more deferential standard of review.  363 F.\xc2\xa03d 846, 849\xe2\x80\x93855 (2004).  The panel majority went on to reject Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the application of the standard to the facts of the case.  <em>Id.</em>, at 855\xe2\x80\x93858.  Judge Fletcher dissented, renewing his contention that Act 257 should not be reviewed under the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  <em>Id.</em>, at 859\xe2\x80\x93861.  We granted certiorari, 543 U. S. ___ (2004), and now reverse.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment, made applicable to the States through the Fourteenth, see <em>Chicago, B. &amp; Q. R. Co.</em> v. <em>Chicago</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/166/226/index.html">166 U. S. 226</a> (1897), provides that private property shall not \xe2\x80\x9cbe taken for public use, without just compensation.\xe2\x80\x9d  As its text makes plain, the Takings Clause \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not prohibit the taking of private property, but instead places a condition on the exercise of that power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale</em> v. <em>County of Los Angeles</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/482/304/index.html">482 U.

In other words, it \xe2\x80\x9cis designed not to limit the governmental interference with property rights <em>per se</em>, but rather to secure <em>compensation </em>in the event of otherwise proper interference amounting to a taking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 315 (emphasis in original).  While scholars have offered various justifications for this regime, we have emphasized its role in \xe2\x80\x9cbar[ring] Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Armstrong</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/364/40/index.html">364 U.

First, where government requires an owner to suffer a permanent physical invasion of her property\xe2\x80\x94however minor\xe2\x80\x94it must provide just compensation.  See <em>Loretto</em> v. <em>Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/458/419/index.html">458 U. S. 419</a> (1982) (state law requiring landlords to permit cable companies to install cable facilities in apartment buildings effected a taking).  A second categorical rule applies to regulations that completely deprive an owner of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>all</em> economically beneficial us[e]\xe2\x80\x9d of her property.  <em>Lucas</em>, 505 U. S., at 1019 (emphasis in original).  We held in <em>Lucas</em> that the government must pay just compensation for such \xe2\x80\x9ctotal regulatory takings,\xe2\x80\x9d except to the extent that \xe2\x80\x9cbackground principles of nuisance and property law\xe2\x80\x9d independently restrict the owner\xe2\x80\x99s intended use of the property.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1026\xe2\x80\x931032.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Outside these two relatively narrow categories (and the special context of land-use exactions discussed below, see <em>infra</em>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9318), regulatory takings challenges are governed by the standards set forth in <em>Penn Central Transp. Co.</em> v. <em>New York City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/438/104/index.html"></a><a href="/us/438/104/index.html">438 U. S. 104</a> (1978).  The Court in <em>Penn Central </em>acknowledged that it had hitherto been \xe2\x80\x9cunable to develop any \xe2\x80\x98set formula\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for evaluating regulatory takings claims, but identified \xe2\x80\x9cseveral factors that have particular significance.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 124.  Primary among those factors are \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant and, particularly, the extent to which the regulation has interfered with distinct investment-backed expectations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In addition, the \xe2\x80\x9ccharacter of the governmental action\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94for instance whether it amounts to a physical invasion or instead merely affects property interests through \xe2\x80\x9csome public program adjusting the benefits and burdens of economic life to promote the common good\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94may be relevant in discerning whether a taking has occurred.  <em>Ibid.  </em>The <em>Penn Central </em>factors\xe2\x80\x94though each has given rise to vexing subsidiary questions\xe2\x80\x94have served as the principal guidelines for resolving regulatory takings claims that do not fall within the physical takings or <em>Lucas </em>rules.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Palazzolo</em> v. <em>Rhode Island</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/606/index.html">533 U.

Each aims to identify regulatory actions that are functionally equivalent to the classic taking in which government directly appropriates private property or ousts the owner from his domain.  Accordingly, each of these tests focuses directly upon the severity of the burden<em> </em>that government imposes upon private property rights.  The Court has held that physical takings require compensation because of the unique burden they impose: A permanent physical invasion, however minimal the economic cost it entails, eviscerates the owner\xe2\x80\x99s right to exclude others from entering and using her property\xe2\x80\x94perhaps the most fundamental of all property interests.  See <em>Dolan</em> v. <em>City of Tigard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/374/index.html"></a><a href="/us/512/374/index.html">512 U.

S. 164</a>, 176 (1979).  In the <em>Lucas</em> context, of course, the complete elimination of a property\xe2\x80\x99s value is the determinative factor.  See <em>Lucas</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1017 (positing that \xe2\x80\x9ctotal deprivation of beneficial use is, from the landowner\xe2\x80\x99s point of view, the equivalent of a physical appropriation\xe2\x80\x9d).  And the <em>Penn Central </em>inquiry turns in large part, albeit not exclusively, upon the magnitude of a regulation\xe2\x80\x99s economic impact and the degree to which it interferes with legitimate property interests.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>In <em>Agins</em> v. <em>City of Tiburon</em>, a case involving a facial takings challenge to certain municipal zoning ordinances, the Court declared that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking if the ordinance does not substantially advance legitimate state interests, see <em>Nectow</em> v. <em>Cambridge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/183/index.html"></a><a href="/us/277/183/index.html">277 U.

Because this statement is phrased in the disjunctive, <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d language has been read to announce a stand-alone regulatory takings test that is wholly independent of <em>Penn Central </em>or any other test.  Indeed, the lower courts in this case struck down Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s rent control statute as an \xe2\x80\x9cunconstitutional regulatory taking,\xe2\x80\x9d 198 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1193, based solely upon a finding that it does not substantially advance the State\xe2\x80\x99s asserted interest in controlling retail gasoline prices.  See <em>supra</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Although a number of our takings precedents have recited the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula minted in <em>Agins</em>, this is our first opportunity to consider its validity as a freestanding takings test.  We conclude that this formula prescribes an inquiry in the nature of a due process, not a takings, test, and that it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no question that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula was derived from due process, not takings, precedents.  In support of this new language,<em> Agins </em>cited <em>Nectow</em> v. <em>Cambridge</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/277/183/index.html"></a><a href="/us/277/183/index.html">277 U.

S. 365</a> (1926), a historic decision holding that a municipal zoning ordinance would survive a substantive due process challenge so long as it was not \xe2\x80\x9cclearly arbitrary and unreasonable, having no <em>substantial relation to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395 (emphasis added); see also <em>Nectow</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 188 (quoting the same \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial relation\xe2\x80\x9d language from <em>Euclid</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When viewed in historical context, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Nectow </em>and <em>Euclid </em>is understandable.  <em>Agins </em>was the Court\xe2\x80\x99s first case involving a challenge to zoning regulations in many decades, so it was natural to turn to these seminal zoning precedents for guidance.  See Brief for United States as <em>Amicus Curiae</em> in <em>Agins</em> v. <em>City of Tiburon</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1979, No. 602, pp. 12\xe2\x80\x9313 (arguing that <em>Euclid </em>\xe2\x80\x9cset out the principles applicable to a determination of the facial validity of a zoning ordinance attacked as a violation of the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d).  Moreover, <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 apparent commingling of due process and takings inquiries had some precedent in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s then-recent decision in <em>Penn Central</em>.  See 438 U. S., at 127 (stating in dicta that \xe2\x80\x9c[i]t is \xe2\x80\xa6 implicit in <em>Goldblatt </em>[v. <em>Hempstead</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/369/590/index.html">369 U.

But see <em>Goldblatt</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 594\xe2\x80\x93595 (quoting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonably necessary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d language from <em>Lawton</em> v. <em>Steele</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/152/133/index.html">152 U.

Finally, when <em>Agins </em>was decided, there had been some history of referring to deprivations of property without due process of law as \xe2\x80\x9ctakings,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Rowan</em> v. <em>Post Office Dept.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/397/728/index.html">397 U. S. 728</a>, 740 (1970), and the Court had yet to clarify whether \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory takings\xe2\x80\x9d claims were properly cognizable under the Takings Clause or the Due Process Clause, see <em>Williamson County Regional Planning Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>Hamilton Bank of Jefferson City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/473/172/index.html">473 U. S. 172</a>, 197\xe2\x80\x93199 (1985).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 reliance on due process precedents is understandable, the language the Court selected was regrettably imprecise.  The \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula suggests a means-ends test: It asks, in essence, whether a regulation of private property is <em>effective</em> in achieving some legitimate public purpose.  An inquiry of this nature has some logic in the context of a due process challenge, for a regulation that fails to serve any legitimate governmental objective may be so arbitrary or irrational that it runs afoul of the Due Process Clause.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>County of Sacramento</em> v. <em>Lewis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/523/833/index.html">523 U. S. 833</a>, 846 (1998) (stating that the Due Process Clause is intended, in part, to protect the individual against \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of power without any reasonable justification in the service of a legitimate governmental objective\xe2\x80\x9d).<font b="1">  But such a test is not a valid method of discerning whether private property has been \xe2\x80\x9ctaken\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Fifth Amendment.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In stark contrast to the three regulatory takings tests discussed above, the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry reveals nothing about the <em>magnitude or character of the burden </em>a particular regulation imposes upon private property rights.  Nor does it provide any information about how any regulatory burden is <em>distributed</em> among property owners.  In consequence, this test does not help to identify those regulations whose effects are functionally comparable to government appropriation or invasion of private property; it is tethered neither to the text of the Takings Clause nor to the basic justification for allowing regulatory actions to be challenged under the Clause.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chevron appeals to the general principle that the Takings Clause is meant \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98to bar Government from forcing some people alone to bear public burdens which, in all fairness and justice, should be borne by the public as a whole.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 17\xe2\x80\x9321 (quoting <em>Armstrong</em>, 364 U. S., at 49).  But that appeal is clearly misplaced, for the reasons just indicated.  A test that tells us nothing about the actual burden imposed on property rights, or how that burden is allocated cannot tell us when justice might require that the burden be spread among taxpayers through the payment of compensation.  The owner of a property subject to a regulation that <em>effectively</em> serves a legitimate state interest may be just as singled out and just as burdened as the owner of a property subject to an <em>ineffective</em> regulation.  It would make little sense to say that the second owner has suffered a taking while the first has not.  Likewise, an ineffective regulation may not significantly burden property rights at all, and it may distribute any burden broadly and evenly among property owners.  The notion that such a regulation nevertheless \xe2\x80\x9ctakes\xe2\x80\x9d private property for public use merely by virtue of its ineffectiveness or foolishness is untenable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Instead of addressing a challenged regulation\xe2\x80\x99s effect on private property, the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry probes the regulation\xe2\x80\x99s underlying validity.  But such an inquiry is logically prior to and distinct from the question whether a regulation effects a taking, for the Takings Clause presupposes that the government has acted in pursuit of a valid public purpose.  The Clause expressly requires compensation where government takes private property \xe2\x80\x9c<em>for public use</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not bar government from interfering with property rights, but rather requires compensation \xe2\x80\x9cin the event of <em>otherwise proper interference</em> amounting to a taking.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>First English Evangelical Lutheran Church</em>, 482 U. S., at 315 (emphasis added).  Conversely, if a government action is found to be impermissible\xe2\x80\x94for instance because it fails to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cpublic use\xe2\x80\x9d requirement or is so arbitrary as to violate due process\xe2\x80\x94that is the end of the inquiry.  No amount of compensation can authorize such action.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s challenge to the Hawaii statute in this case illustrates the flaws in the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d theory.  To begin with, it is unclear how significantly Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s rent cap actually burdens Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s property rights.  The parties stipulated below that the cap would reduce Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s aggregate rental income on 11 of its 64 lessee-dealer stations by about $207,000 per year, but that Chevron nevertheless expects to receive a return on its investment in these stations that satisfies any constitutional standard.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4.  Moreover, Chevron asserted below, and the District Court found, that Chevron would recoup any reductions in its rental income by raising wholesale gasoline prices.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5.  In short, Chevron has not clearly argued\xe2\x80\x94let alone established\xe2\x80\x94that it has been singled out to bear any particularly severe regulatory burden.  Rather, the gravamen of Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s claim is simply that Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s rent cap will not actually serve the State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting consumers against high gasoline prices.  Whatever the merits of that claim, it does not sound under the Takings Clause.  Chevron plainly does not seek compensation for a taking of its property for a legitimate public use, but rather an injunction against the enforcement of a regulation that it alleges to be fundamentally arbitrary and irrational.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula is not only <em>doctrinally</em> untenable as a takings test\xe2\x80\x94its application as such would also present serious practical difficulties.  The <em>Agins</em> formula can be read to demand heightened means-ends review of virtually any regulation of private property.  If so interpreted, it would require courts to scrutinize the efficacy of a vast array of state and federal regulations\xe2\x80\x94a task for which courts are not well suited.  Moreover, it would empower\xe2\x80\x94and might often require\xe2\x80\x94courts to substitute their predictive judgments for those of elected legislatures and expert agencies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the instant case is only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, it foreshadows the hazards of placing courts in this role.  To resolve Chevron\xe2\x80\x99s takings claim, the District Court was required to choose between the views of two opposing economists as to whether Hawaii\xe2\x80\x99s rent control statute would help to prevent concentration and supracompetitive prices in the State\xe2\x80\x99s retail gasoline market.  Finding one expert to be \xe2\x80\x9cmore persuasive\xe2\x80\x9d than the other, the court concluded that the Hawaii Legislature\xe2\x80\x99s chosen regulatory strategy would not actually achieve its objectives.  See 198 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1187\xe2\x80\x931193.  Along the way, the court determined that the State was not entitled to enact a prophylactic rent cap without actual evidence that oil companies had charged, or would charge, excessive rents.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1191<em>.</em>  Based on these findings, the District Court enjoined further enforcement of Act 257\xe2\x80\x99s rent cap provision against Chevron.  We find the proceedings below remarkable, to say the least, given that we have long eschewed such heightened scrutiny when addressing substantive due process challenges to government regulation.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Exxon Corp.</em> v. <em>Governor of Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/437/117/index.html">437 U. S. 117</a>, 124\xe2\x80\x93125 (1978); <em>Ferguson</em> v. <em>Skrupa</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/372/726/index.html">372 U. S. 726</a>, 730\xe2\x80\x93732 (1963).  The reasons for deference to legislative judgments about the need for, and likely effectiveness of, regulatory actions are by now well established, and we think they are no less applicable here.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula announced in <em>Agins </em>is not a valid method of identifying regulatory takings for which the Fifth Amendment requires just compensation.  Since Chevron argued only a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d theory in support of its takings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment on that claim.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We emphasize that our holding today\xe2\x80\x94that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula is not a valid takings test\xe2\x80\x94does not require us to disturb any of our prior holdings.  To be sure, we applied a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry in <em>Agins </em>itself, see 447 U. S., at 261\xe2\x80\x93262 (finding that the challenged zoning ordinances \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advance[d] legitimate governmental goals\xe2\x80\x9d), and arguably also in <em>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn.</em> v. <em>DeBenedictis</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/470/index.html">480 U.

But in no case have we found a compensable taking based on such an inquiry.  Indeed, in most of the cases reciting the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula, the Court has merely assumed its validity when referring to it in dicta.

See Brief for Respondent 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  But while the Court drew upon the language of <em>Agins </em>in these cases, it did not apply the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d test that is the subject of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Both <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan </em>involved Fifth Amendment takings challenges to adjudicative land-use exactions\xe2\x80\x94specifically, government demands that a landowner dedicate an easement allowing public access to her property as a condition of obtaining a development permit.  See <em>Dolan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 379\xe2\x80\x93380 (permit to expand a store and parking lot conditioned on the dedication of a portion of the relevant property for a \xe2\x80\x9cgreenway,\xe2\x80\x9d including a bike/pedestrian path); <em>Nollan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 828 (permit to build a larger residence on beachfront property conditioned on dedication of an easement allowing the public to traverse a strip of the property between the owner\xe2\x80\x99s seawall and the mean high-tide line).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In each case, the Court began with the premise that, had the government simply appropriated the easement in question, this would have been a <em>per se </em>physical taking.  <em>Dolan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 384; <em>Nollan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 831\xe2\x80\x93832.  The question was whether the government could, without paying the compensation that would otherwise be required upon effecting such a taking, demand the easement as a condition for granting a development permit the government was entitled to deny.  The Court in <em>Nolan</em> answered in the affirmative, provided that the exaction would substantially advance the same government interest that would furnish a valid ground for denial of the permit.  483 U. S., at 834\xe2\x80\x93837.  The Court further refined this requirement in <em>Dolan</em>, holding that an adjudicative exaction requiring dedication of private property must also be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98rough[ly] proportiona[l]\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 both in nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 391; see also <em>Del Monte Dunes</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 702 (emphasizing that we have not extended this standard \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond the special context of [such] exactions\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan </em>quoted <em>Agins</em>\xe2\x80\x99 language, see <em>Dolan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 385; <em>Nollan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 834, the rule those decisions established is entirely distinct from the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d test we address today.  Whereas the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry before us now is unconcerned with the degree or type of burden a regulation places upon property, <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan </em>both involved dedications of property so onerous that, outside the exactions context, they would be deemed <em>per se </em>physical takings.  In neither case did the Court question whether the exaction would substantially advance <em>some </em>legitimate state interest.  See <em>Dolan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 387\xe2\x80\x93388; <em>Nollan</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 841.  Rather, the issue was whether the exactions substantially advanced the <em>same</em> interests that land-use authorities asserted would allow them to deny the permit altogether.  As the Court explained in <em>Dolan</em>, these cases involve a special application of the \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine of \xe2\x80\x98unconstitutional conditions,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d which provides that \xe2\x80\x9cthe government may not require a person to give up a constitutional right\xe2\x80\x94here the right to receive just compensation when property is taken for a public use\xe2\x80\x94in exchange for a discretionary benefit conferred by the government where the benefit has little or no relationship to the property.\xe2\x80\x9d  512 U. S., at 385.  That is worlds apart from a rule that says a regulation affecting property constitutes a taking on its face solely because it does not substantially advance a legitimate government interest.  In short, <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan </em>cannot be characterized as applying the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d test we address today, and our decision should not be read to disturb these precedents.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Twenty-five years ago, the Court posited that a regulation of private property \xe2\x80\x9ceffects a taking if [it] does not substantially advance [a] legitimate state interes[t].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Agins</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 260.  The lower courts in this case took that statement to its logical conclusion, and in so doing, revealed its imprecision.  Today we correct course.  We hold that the \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d formula is not a valid takings test, and indeed conclude that it has no proper place in our takings jurisprudence.  In so doing, we reaffirm that a plaintiff seeking to challenge a government regulation as an uncompensated taking of private property may proceed under one of the other theories discussed above\xe2\x80\x94by alleging a \xe2\x80\x9cphysical\xe2\x80\x9d taking, a <em>Lucas</em>-type \xe2\x80\x9ctotal regulatory taking,\xe2\x80\x9d a <em>Penn Central </em>taking, or a land-use exaction violating the standards set forth in <em>Nollan </em>and <em>Dolan</em>.  Because Chevron argued only a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially advances\xe2\x80\x9d theory in support of its takings claim, it was not entitled to summary judgment on that claim.  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the Ninth Circuit and remand the case for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n</font></font></div><font b="1"><font b="1">\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1961835">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\n544 U.
