American Civil Liberties Union, \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tContent-based restrictions on speech have been permitted only for a few historic categories of speech, including incitement, obscenity, defamation, speech integral to criminal conduct, so-called \xe2\x80\x9cfighting words,\xe2\x80\x9d child pornography, fraud, true threats, and speech presenting some grave and imminent threat the Government has the power to prevent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAbsent from these few categories is any general exception for false statements.  The Government argues that cases such as Hustler Magazine, Inc., v. Falwell, \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46\n, support its claim that false statements have no value and hence no \n \nFirst Amendment protection.  But all the Government\xe2\x80\x99s quotations derive from cases discussing defamation, fraud, or some other legally cognizable harm associated with a false statement.  In those decisions the falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis, but neither was it determinative.  These prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven when considering some instances of defamation or fraud, the Court has instructed that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the \n \nFirst Amendment; the statement must be a knowing and reckless falsehood.  See New York Times v. Sullivan, \n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254\n.  Here, the Government seeks to convert a rule that limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government\xe2\x80\x99s three examples of false-speech regulation that courts generally have found permissible do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from rigorous \n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny.  The criminal prohibition of a false statement made to Government officials in communications concerning official matters, \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001, does not lead to the broader proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at any time, in any context.  As for perjury statutes, perjured statements lack \n \nFirst Amendment protection not simply because they are false, but because perjury undermines the function and province of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments.  Finally, there are statutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or prohibit impersonating a Government officer.  These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile there may exist \xe2\x80\x9csome categories of speech that have been historically unprotected,\xe2\x80\x9d but that the Court has not yet specifically identified or discussed, United States v. Stevens, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___, the Government has not demonstrated that false statements should constitute a new category.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x88\x9210.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The Act seeks to control and suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and settings without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.  Permitting the Government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.  That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x88\x9211.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The Court applies the \xe2\x80\x9cmost exacting scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d in assessing content-based restrictions on protected speech.  Turner Broadcasting System Inc. v. FCC, \n\n512 U.\xc2\xa0S. 622\n.  The Act does not satisfy that scrutiny.  While the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in protecting the integrity of the Medal of Honor is beyond question, the \n \nFirst Amendment requires that there be a direct causal link between the restriction imposed and the injury to be prevented.  Here, that link has not been shown.  The Government points to no evidence supporting its claim that the public\xe2\x80\x99s general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims such as those made by respondent.  And it has not shown, and cannot show, why counterspeech, such as the ridicule respondent received online and in the press, would not suffice to achieve its interest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the restriction must be the \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 666.  Here, the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system by creating a database of Medal winners accessible and searchable on the Internet, as some private individuals have already done.

Pp. 1\xe2\x88\x9210.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(a)\xc2\xa0In determining whether a statute violates the \n \nFirst Amendment, the Court has often found it appropriate to examine the fit between statutory ends and means, taking into account the seriousness of the speech-related harm the provision will likely cause, the nature and importance of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s countervailing objectives, the extent to which the statute will tend to achieve those objectives, and whether there are other, less restrictive alternatives.  \xe2\x80\x9cIntermediate scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d describes this approach.  Since false factual statements are less likely than true factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the marketplace of ideas, and the government often has good reason to prohibit such false speech, but its regulation can threaten speech-related harm, such an approach is applied here.  Pp.\xc2\xa01\xe2\x88\x923.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(b)\xc2\xa0The Act should be read as criminalizing only false factual statements made with knowledge of their falsity and with intent that they be taken as true.  Although the Court has frequently said or implied that false factual statements enjoy little \n \nFirst Amendment protection, see, e.g., Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc., \n\n418 U.\xc2\xa0S. 323\n, those statements cannot be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9cno protection at all.\xe2\x80\x9d  False factual statements serve useful human objectives in many contexts.  Moreover, the threat of criminal prosecution for making a false statement can inhibit the speaker from making true statements, thereby \xe2\x80\x9cchilling\xe2\x80\x9d a kind of speech that lies at the \n \nFirst Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s heart.  See id., at 340\xe2\x88\x92341.  And the pervasiveness of false factual statements provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to prosecute falsity without more.  Those who are unpopular may fear that the government will use that weapon selectively against them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough there are many statutes and common-law doctrines making the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful, they tend to be narrower than the Act, in that they limit the scope of their application in various ways, for example, by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims.  The Act lacks any such limiting features.  Although it prohibits only knowing and intentional falsehoods about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the speaker, it otherwise ranges broadly, and that breadth means that it creates a significant risk of \n \nFirst Amendment harm.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x88\x928.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(c)\xc2\xa0The Act nonetheless has substantial justification.  It seeks to protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life for their country by seeking to preserve intact the country\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors.  P.\xc2\xa08.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(d)\xc2\xa0It may, however, be possible substantially to achieve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s objective in less burdensome ways.  The \n \nFirst Amendment risks flowing from the Act\xe2\x80\x99s breadth of coverage could be diminished or eliminated by a more finely tailored statute, for example, a statute that requires a showing that the false statement caused specific harm or is focused on lies more likely to be harmful or on contexts where such lies are likely to cause harm.

Xavier Alvarez, the respondent here, lied when he said that he played hockey for the Detroit Red Wings and that he once married a starlet from Mexico.  But when he lied in announcing he held the Con-gressional Medal of Honor, respondent ventured onto new ground; for that lie violates a federal criminal statute, the Stolen Valor Act of 2005.  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2007, respondent attended his first public meeting as a board member of the Three Valley Water District Board.  The board is a governmental entity with headquarters in Claremont, California.  He introduced himself as follows: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m a retired marine of 25 years.  I retired in the year 2001.  Back in 1987, I was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.

For all the record shows, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s statements were but a pathetic attempt to gain respect that eluded him.  The statements do not seem to have been made to secure employment or financial benefits or admission to privileges reserved for those who had earned the Medal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent was indicted under the Stolen Valor Act for lying about the Congressional Medal of Honor at the meeting.  The United States District Court for the Central District of California rejected his claim that the statute is invalid under the \n \nFirst Amendment.  Respondent pleaded guilty to one count, reserving the right to appeal on his \n \nFirst Amendment claim.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act invalid under the \n \nFirst Amendment and reversed the conviction.  Id., at 1218.  With further opinions on the issue, and over a dissent by seven judges, rehearing en banc was denied.  638 F.\xc2\xa03d 666 (2011).  This Court granted certiorari.  565 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAfter certiorari was granted, and in an unrelated case, the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, also in a decision by a divided panel, found the Act constitutional.  United States v. Strandlof, 667 F.\xc2\xa03d 1146 (2012).

See Snyder v. Phelps, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011) (hateful protests directed at the funeral of a serviceman who died in Iraq).  Here the statement that the speaker held the Medal was an intended, undoubted lie.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is right and proper that Congress, over a century ago, established an award so the Nation can hold in its high- est respect and esteem those who, in the course of carrying out the \xe2\x80\x9csupreme and noble duty of contributing to the defense of the rights and honor of the nation,\xe2\x80\x9d Selective Draft Law Cases, \n\n245 U.\xc2\xa0S. 366, \n390 (1918)\n, have acted with extraordinary honor.  And it should be uncontested that this is a legitimate Government objective, indeed a most valued national aspiration and purpose.  This does not end the inquiry, however.  Fundamental constitutional principles require that laws enacted to honor the brave must be consistent with the precepts of the Constitution for which they fought.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government contends the criminal prohibition is a proper means to further its purpose in creating and awarding the Medal.  When content-based speech regulation is in question, however, exacting scrutiny is required.  Statutes suppressing or restricting speech must be judged by the sometimes inconvenient principles of the \n \nFirst Amendment.  By this measure, the statutory provisions under which respondent was convicted must be held invalid, and his conviction must be set aside.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tRespondent\xe2\x80\x99s claim to hold the Congressional Medal of Honor was false.

The Government defends the statute as necessary to preserve the integrity and purpose of the Medal, an integrity and purpose it contends are compromised and frustrated by the false statements the statute prohibits.

This comports with the common understanding that some false statements are inevitable if there is to be an open and vigorous expression of views in public and private con-versation, expression the \n \nFirst Amendment seeks to guarantee.  See Sullivan, supra, at 271 (\xe2\x80\x9cTh[e] erroneous statement is inevitable in free debate\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government disagrees with this proposition.  It cites language from some of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents to support its contention that false statements have no value and hence no \n \nFirst Amendment protection.  See also Brief for Eugene Volokh et al. as Amici Curiae 2\xe2\x80\x9311.  These isolated statements in some earlier decisions do not support the Government\xe2\x80\x99s submission that false statements, as a general rule, are beyond constitutional protection.  That conclusion would take the quoted language far from its proper context.  For instance, the Court has stated \xe2\x80\x9c[f]alse statements of fact are particularly valueless [because] they interfere with the truth-seeking function of the marketplace of ideas,\xe2\x80\x9d Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, \n\n485 U.\xc2\xa0S. 46, \n52 (1988)\n, and that false statements \xe2\x80\x9care not protected by the \n \nFirst Amendment in the same manner as truthful statements,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown v.

See also, e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, supra, at 771 (\xe2\x80\x9cUntruthful speech, commercial or otherwise, has never been protected for its own sake\xe2\x80\x9d); Herbert v.

See Brief for United States 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  In those decisions the falsity of the speech at issue was not irrelevant to our analysis, but neither was it determinative.  The Court has never endorsed the categorical rule the Government advances: that false statements receive no \n \nFirst Amendment protection.  Our prior decisions have not confronted a measure, like the Stolen Valor Act, that targets falsity and nothing more.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven when considering some instances of defamation and fraud, moreover, the Court has been careful to instruct that falsity alone may not suffice to bring the speech outside the \n \nFirst Amendment.  The statement must be a knowing or reckless falsehood.  See Sullivan, supra, at 280 (prohibiting recovery of damages for a defamatory falsehood made about a public official unless the statement was made \xe2\x80\x9cwith knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of whether it was false or not\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Garrison, supra, at 73 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven when the utterance is false, the great principles of the Constitution which secure freedom of expression .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. preclude attaching adverse consequences to any except the knowing or reckless falsehood\xe2\x80\x9d); Illinois ex rel. Madigan v. Telemarketing Associates, Inc., \n\n538 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600, \n620 (2003)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cFalse statement alone does not subject a fundraiser to fraud liability\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government thus seeks to use this principle for a new purpose.  It seeks to convert a rule that limits liability even in defamation cases where the law permits recovery for tortious wrongs into a rule that expands liability in a different, far greater realm of discourse and expression.  That inverts the rationale for the exception.  The requirements of a knowing falsehood or reckless disregard for the truth as the condition for recovery in certain defamation cases exists to allow more speech, not less.  A rule designed to tolerate certain speech ought not blossom to become a rationale for a rule restricting it.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government then gives three examples of regulations on false speech that courts generally have found per-missible: first, the criminal prohibition of a false statement made to a Government official, \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001; second, laws punishing perjury; and third, prohibi-tions on the false representation that one is speaking as a Government official or on behalf of the Government, see, e.g., \xc2\xa7912; \xc2\xa7709.  These restrictions, however, do not establish a principle that all proscriptions of false statements are exempt from exacting \n \nFirst Amendment scrutiny.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe federal statute prohibiting false statements to Government officials punishes \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. makes any mate-rially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or repre-sentation.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71001.  Section 1001\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition on false statements made to Government officials, in communications concerning official matters, does not lead to the broader proposition that false statements are unprotected when made to any person, at any time, in any context.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe same point can be made about what the Court has confirmed is the \xe2\x80\x9cunquestioned constitutionality of perjury statutes,\xe2\x80\x9d both the federal statute, \xc2\xa71623, and its state-law equivalents.  United States v. Grayson, \n\n438 U.\xc2\xa0S. 41, \n54 (1978)\n.  See also Konigsberg v. State Bar of Cal., \n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 36\n, n.\xc2\xa010 (1961).  It is not simply because perjured statements are false that they lack \n \nFirst Amendment protection.  Perjured testimony \xe2\x80\x9cis at war with justice\xe2\x80\x9d because it can cause a court to render a \xe2\x80\x9cjudgment not resting on truth.\xe2\x80\x9d  In re Michael, \n\n326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 224, \n227 (1945)\n.  Perjury undermines the function and province of the law and threatens the integrity of judgments that are the basis of the legal system.  See United States v. Dunnigan, \n\n507 U.\xc2\xa0S. 87, \n97 (1993)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cTo uphold the integrity of our trial system .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the constitutionality of perjury statutes is unquestioned\xe2\x80\x9d).  Unlike speech in other contexts, testi-mony under oath has the formality and gravity necessary to remind the witness that his or her statements will be the basis for official governmental action, action that often affects the rights and liberties of others.  Sworn testimony is quite distinct from lies not spoken under oath and sim-ply intended to puff up oneself.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStatutes that prohibit falsely representing that one is speaking on behalf of the Government, or that prohibit im-personating a Government officer, also protect the integrity of Government processes, quite apart from merely restricting false speech.  Title \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7912, for ex-ample, prohibits impersonating an officer or employee of the United States.  Even if that statute may not require proving an \xe2\x80\x9cactual financial or property loss\xe2\x80\x9d resulting from the deception, the statute is itself confined to \xe2\x80\x9cmaintain[ing] the general good repute and dignity of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. government .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. service itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Lepowitch, \n\n318 U.\xc2\xa0S. 702, \n704 (1943)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  The same can be said for prohibitions on the unauthorized use of the names of federal agencies such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation in a manner calculated to convey that the communication is approved, see \xc2\xa7709, or using words such as \xe2\x80\x9cFederal\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cUnited States\xe2\x80\x9d in the collection of private debts in order to convey that the communication has official authorization, see \xc2\xa7712.  These examples, to the extent that they implicate fraud or speech integral to criminal conduct, are inapplicable here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs our law and tradition show, then, there are instances in which the falsity of speech bears upon whether it is protected.  Some false speech may be prohibited even if analogous true speech could not be.  This opinion does not imply that any of these targeted prohibitions are somehow vulnerable.  But it also rejects the notion that false speech should be in a general category that is presumptively unprotected.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the \n \nFirst Amendment stands against any \xe2\x80\x9cfreewheeling authority to declare new categories of speech outside the scope of the \n \nFirst Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d Stevens, 559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9), the Court has acknowledged that perhaps there exist \xe2\x80\x9csome categories of speech that have been historically unprotected .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. but have not yet been specifically identified or discussed .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in our case law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Before exempting a category of speech from the normal prohibition on content-based re-strictions, however, the Court must be presented with \xe2\x80\x9cper-suasive evidence that a novel restriction on content is part of a long (if heretofore unrecognized) tradition of proscription,\xe2\x80\x9d Brown v. Entertainment Merchants Assn., 564 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 4).  The Government has not demonstrated that false statements generally should constitute a new category of unprotected speech on this basis.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe probable, and adverse, effect of the Act on free- dom of expression illustrates, in a fundamental way, the reasons for the Law\xe2\x80\x99s distrust of content-based speech prohibitions.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Act by its plain terms applies to a false statement made at any time, in any place, to any person.  It can be assumed that it would not apply to, say, a theatrical performance.  See Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., \n\n497 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, \n20 (1990)\n (recognizing that some statements nominally purporting to contain false facts in reality \xe2\x80\x9ccannot reasonably be interpreted as stating actual facts about an individual\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).  Still, the sweeping, quite unprecedented reach of the statute puts it in conflict with the \n \nFirst Amendment.  Here the lie was made in a public meeting, but the statute would apply with equal force to personal, whispered conversations within a home.  The statute seeks to control and suppress all false statements on this one subject in almost limitless times and settings.  And it does so en-tirely without regard to whether the lie was made for the purpose of material gain.  See San Francisco Arts &amp; Athletics, Inc. v. United States Olympic Comm., \n\n483 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522\n\xe2\x80\x93540 (1987) (prohibiting a nonprofit corporation from exploiting the \xe2\x80\x9ccommercial magnetism\xe2\x80\x9d of the word \xe2\x80\x9cOlym-pic\xe2\x80\x9d when organizing an athletic competition (internal quotation marks omitted)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPermitting the government to decree this speech to be a criminal offense, whether shouted from the rooftops or made in a barely audible whisper, would endorse government authority to compile a list of subjects about which false statements are punishable.  That governmental power has no clear limiting principle.  Our constitutional tradition stands against the idea that we need Oceania\xe2\x80\x99s Ministry of Truth.  See G. Orwell, Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949) (Centennial ed. 2003).  Were this law to be sustained, there could be an endless list of subjects the National Government or the States could single out.  Where false claims are made to effect a fraud or secure moneys or other valuable considerations, say offers of employment, it is well established that the Government may restrict speech without affronting the \n \nFirst Amendment.  See, e.g., Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy, 425 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 771 (noting that fraudulent speech generally falls outside the protections of the \n \nFirst Amendment).  But the Stolen Valor Act is not so limited in its reach.  Were the Court to hold that the interest in truthful discourse alone is sufficient to sustain a ban on speech, absent any evidence that the speech was used to gain a material advantage, it would give government a broad censorial power unprecedented in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s cases or in our constitutional tradition.  The mere potential for the exercise of that power casts a chill, a chill the \n \nFirst Amendment cannot permit if free speech, thought, and discourse are to remain a foundation of our freedom.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe previous discussion suffices to show that the Act conflicts with free speech principles.  But even when examined within its own narrow sphere of operation, the Act cannot survive.

It must be acknowledged that when a pretender claims the Medal to be his own, the lie might harm the Government by demeaning the high purpose of the award, diminishing the honor it confirms, and creating the appearance that the Medal is awarded more often than is true.  Furthermore, the lie may offend the true holders of the Medal.  From one perspective it in-sults their bravery and high principles when falsehood puts them in the unworthy company of a pretender.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tYet these interests do not satisfy the Government\xe2\x80\x99s heavy burden when it seeks to regulate protected speech.  See United States v. Playboy Entertainment Group, Inc., \n\n529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 803, \n818 (2000)\n.  The Government points to no evidence to support its claim that the public\xe2\x80\x99s general perception of military awards is diluted by false claims such as those made by Alvarez.  Cf. Entertainment Merchants Assn., supra, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 12\xe2\x80\x9313) (analyzing and rejecting the findings of research psychologists demonstrating the causal link between violent video games and harmful effects on children).  As one of the Government\xe2\x80\x99s amici notes \xe2\x80\x9cthere is nothing that charlatans such as Xavier Alvarez can do to stain [the Medal winners\xe2\x80\x99] honor.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 1.  This general proposition is sound, even if true holders of the Medal might experience anger and frustration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe lack of a causal link between the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated interest and the Act is not the only way in which the Act is not actually necessary to achieve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s stated interest.  The Government has not shown, and cannot show, why counterspeech would not suffice to achieve its interest.  The facts of this case indicate that the dynamics of free speech, of counterspeech, of refutation, can overcome the lie.  Respondent lied at a public meeting.  Even before the FBI began investigating him for his false statements \xe2\x80\x9cAlvarez was perceived as a phony,\xe2\x80\x9d 617 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1211.  Once the lie was made public, he was ridiculed online, see Brief for Respondent 3, his actions were reported in the press, see Ortega, Alvarez Again Denies Claim, Ontario, CA, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin (Sept. 27, 2007), and a fellow board member called for his resignation, see, e.g., Bigham, Water District Rep Requests Alvarez Resign in Wake of False Medal Claim,  San Bernardino Cty., CA, The Sun (May 21, 2008).  There is good reason to believe that a similar fate would befall other false claimants.  See Brief for Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press et al. as Amici Curiae 30\xe2\x80\x9333 (listing numerous examples of public exposure of false claimants).  Indeed, the outrage and contempt expressed for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s lies can serve to reawaken and reinforce the public\xe2\x80\x99s respect for the Medal, its recipients, and its high purpose.  The acclaim that recipients of the Congressional Medal of Honor receive also casts doubt on the proposition that the public will be misled by the claims of charlatans or become cynical of those whose heroic deeds earned them the Medal by right.  See, e.g., Well Done, Washington Post, Feb. 5, 1943, p.\xc2\xa08 (reporting on Pres-ident Roosevelt\xe2\x80\x99s awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to Maj. Gen. Alexander Vandegrift); Devroy, Medal of Honor Given to 2 Killed in Somalia, Washington Post, May 24, 1994, p.\xc2\xa0A6 (reporting on President Clinton\xe2\x80\x99s awarding the Congressional Medal of Honor to two special forces soldiers killed during operations in Somalia).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true.  This is the ordinary course in a free society.  The response to the unreasoned is the rational; to the uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth.  See Whitney v. California, \n\n274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 357, \n377 (1927)\n (Brandeis, J., concurring) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf there be time to expose through discussion the falsehood and fallacies, to avert the evil by the processes of education, the remedy to be ap-plied is more speech, not enforced silence\xe2\x80\x9d).  The theory of our Constitution is \xe2\x80\x9cthat the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market,\xe2\x80\x9d Abrams v. United States, \n\n250 U.\xc2\xa0S. 616, \n630 (1919)\n (Holmes, J., dissenting).  The \n \nFirst Amendment itself ensures the right to respond to speech we do not like, and for good reason.  Freedom of speech and thought flows not from the beneficence of the state but from the inalienable rights of the person.  And suppression of speech by the government can make exposure of falsity more difficult, not less so.  Society has the right and civic duty to engage in open, dynamic, rational discourse.  These ends are not well served when the government seeks to orchestrate public discussion through content-based mandates.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tExpressing its concern that counterspeech is insuf- ficient, the Government responds that because \xe2\x80\x9csome military records have been lost .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. some claims [are] un-verifiable,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for United States 50.  This proves little, however; for without verifiable records, successful criminal prosecution under the Act would be more difficult in any event.  So, in cases where public refutation will not serve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest, the Act will not either.  In addition, the Government claims that \xe2\x80\x9cmany [false claims] will remain unchallenged.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 55.  The Government provides no support for the contention.  And in any event, in order to show that public refutation is not an adequate alternative, the Government must demonstrate that unchallenged claims undermine the public\xe2\x80\x99s perception of the military and the integrity of its awards system.  This showing has not been made.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is a fair assumption that any true holders of the Medal who had heard of Alvarez\xe2\x80\x99s false claims would have been fully vindicated by the community\xe2\x80\x99s expression of outrage, showing as it did the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s high regard for the Medal.  The same can be said for the Government\xe2\x80\x99s interest.  The American people do not need the assistance of a government prosecution to express their high regard for the special place that military heroes hold in our tradi-tion.  Only a weak society needs government protection or intervention before it pursues its resolve to preserve the truth.  Truth needs neither handcuffs nor a badge for its vindication.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition, when the Government seeks to regulate protected speech, the restriction must be the \xe2\x80\x9cleast restrictive means among available, effective alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ashcroft, 542 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 666.  There is, however, at least one less speech-restrictive means by which the Government could likely protect the integrity of the military awards system.\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t  A Government-created database could list Congressional Medal of Honor winners.  Were a database accessible through the Internet, it would be easy to verify and expose false claims.  It appears some private individuals have already created databases similar to this,  see Brief for Respondent 25, and at least one data- base of past winners is online and fully searchable, see Congressional Medal of Honor Society, Full Archive, http://www.cmohs.org/recipient-archive.php.  The Solicitor General responds that although Congress and the Department of Defense investigated the feasibility of establishing a database in 2008, the Government \xe2\x80\x9cconcluded that such a database would be impracticable and insuf-ficiently comprehensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for United States 55.  Without more explanation, it is difficult to assess the Gov-ernment\xe2\x80\x99s claim, especially when at least one database of Congressional Medal of Honor winners already exists.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government may have responses to some of these criticisms, but there has been no clear showing of the necessity of the statute, the necessity required by exacting scrutiny.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Nation well knows that one of the costs of the \n \nFirst Amendment is that it protects the speech we detest as well as the speech we embrace.

Laws restricting false statements about philosophy, religion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and the like raise such concerns, and in many contexts have called for strict scrutiny.  But this case does not involve such a law.  The dangers of suppressing valuable ideas are lower where, as here, the regulations concern false statements about easily verifiable facts that do not concern such subject matter.  Such false factual statements are less likely than are true factual statements to make a valuable contribution to the marketplace of ideas.  And the government often has good reasons to prohibit such false speech.  See infra, at 5\xe2\x80\x937 (listing examples of statutes and doctrines regulating false factual speech).  But its regulation can nonetheless threaten speech-related harms.  Those circumstances lead me to apply what the Court has termed \xe2\x80\x9cintermediate scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Stolen Valor Act makes it a crime \xe2\x80\x9cfalsely\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9crepresen[t]\xe2\x80\x9d oneself \xe2\x80\x9cto have been awarded any decoration or medal authorized by Congress for the Armed Forces of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7704(b).  I would read the statute favorably to the Government as criminalizing only false factual statements made with knowledge of their fal- sity and with the intent that they be taken as true.  See Staples v. United States, \n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 600, \n605 (1994)\n (courts construe statutes \xe2\x80\x9cin light of the background rules of the common law, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in which the requirement of some mens rea for a crime is firmly embedded\xe2\x80\x9d); cf.

As so interpreted the statute covers only lies.  But although this interpretation diminishes the extent to which the statute endangers \n \nFirst Amendment values, it does not eliminate the threat.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI must concede, as the Government points out, that this Court has frequently said or implied that false factual statements enjoy little \n \nFirst Amendment protection.

See, e.g., 638 F.\xc2\xa03d 666, 673\xe2\x80\x93675 (CA9 2011) (Kozinski, J., concurring in denial of rehearing en banc) (providing numerous examples); S.

See, e.g., Gertz, supra, at 340\xe2\x80\x93341.  Hence, the Court emphasizes mens rea requirements that provide \xe2\x80\x9cbreathing room\xe2\x80\x9d for more valuable speech by reducing an honest speaker\xe2\x80\x99s fear that he may accidentally incur liability for speaking.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurther, the pervasiveness of false statements, made for better or for worse motives, made thoughtlessly or de- liberately, made with or without accompanying harm, provides a weapon to a government broadly empowered to prosecute falsity without more.  And those who are unpopular may fear that the government will use that weapon selectively, say by prosecuting a pacifist who sup- ports his cause by (falsely) claiming to have been a war hero, while ignoring members of other political groups who might make similar false claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI also must concede that many statutes and common-law doctrines make the utterance of certain kinds of false statements unlawful.  Those prohibitions, however, tend to be narrower than the statute before us, in that they limit the scope of their application, sometimes by requiring proof of specific harm to identifiable victims; sometimes by specifying that the lies be made in contexts in which a tangible harm to others is especially likely to occur; and sometimes by limiting the prohibited lies to those that are particularly likely to produce harm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFraud statutes, for example, typically require proof of a misrepresentation that is material, upon which the victim relied, and which caused actual injury.  See Restatement (Second) of Torts \xc2\xa7525 (1976).  Defamation statutes focus upon statements of a kind that harm the reputation of another or deter third parties from association or dealing with the victim.  See id., \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7558, 559.

Trademarks identify the source of a good; and infringement causes harm by causing confusion among potential customers (about the source) and thereby diluting the value of the mark to its owner, to consumers, and to the econ- omy.  Similarly, a false claim of possession of a medal or other honor creates confusion about who is entitled to wear it, thus diluting its value to those who have earned it, to their families, and to their country.  But trademark statutes are focused upon commercial and promotional activities that are likely to dilute the value of a mark.  Indeed, they typically require a showing of likely confusion, a showing that tends to assure that the feared harm will in fact take place.

Instead, in virtually all these instances limitations of context, requirements of proof of injury, and the like, narrow the statute to a subset of lies where specific harm is more likely to occur.  The limitations help to make certain that the statute does not allow its threat of liability or criminal punishment to roam at large, discouraging or forbidding the telling of the lie in contexts where harm is unlikely or the need for the prohibition is small.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe statute before us lacks any such limiting features.  It may be construed to prohibit only knowing and intentional acts of deception about readily verifiable facts within the personal knowledge of the speaker, thus reducing the risk that valuable speech is chilled.  Supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  But it still ranges very broadly.  And that breadth means that it creates a significant risk of \n \nFirst Amendment harm.  As written, it applies in family, social, or other private contexts, where lies will often cause little harm.  It also applies in political contexts, where although such lies are more likely to cause harm, the risk of censorious se- lectivity by prosecutors is also high.  Further, given the potential haziness of individual memory along with the large number of military awards covered (ranging from medals for rifle marksmanship to the Congressional Medal of Honor), there remains a risk of chilling that is not completely eliminated by mens rea requirements; a speaker might still be worried about being prosecuted for a careless false statement, even if he does not have the intent required to render him liable.  And so the prohibition may be applied where it should not be applied, for example, to bar stool braggadocio or, in the political arena, subtly but selectively to speakers that the Government does not like.  These considerations lead me to believe that the statute as written risks significant \n \nFirst Amendment harm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tLike both the plurality and the dissent, I believe the statute nonetheless has substantial justification.  It seeks to protect the interests of those who have sacrificed their health and life for their country.  The statute serves this interest by seeking to preserve intact the country\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of that sacrifice in the form of military honors.  To permit those who have not earned those honors to claim otherwise dilutes the value of the awards.  Indeed, the Nation cannot fully honor those who have sacrificed so much for their country\xe2\x80\x99s honor unless those who claim to have received its military awards tell the truth.  Thus, the statute risks harming protected interests but only in order to achieve a substantial countervailing objective.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tC\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe must therefore ask whether it is possible substantially to achieve the Government\xe2\x80\x99s objective in less burdensome ways.  In my view, the answer to this question is \xe2\x80\x9cyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Some potential \n \nFirst Amendment threats can be alleviated by interpreting the statute to require knowledge of falsity, etc.  Supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  But other \n \nFirst Amendment risks, primarily risks flowing from breadth of coverage, remain.  Supra, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, 7\xe2\x80\x938.  As is indicated by the limitations on the scope of the many other kinds of statutes regulating false factual speech, supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x937, it should be possible significantly to diminish or eliminate these re- maining risks by enacting a similar but more finely tailored statute.  For example, not all military awards are alike.  Congress might determine that some warrant greater protection than others.  And a more finely tailored statute might, as other kinds of statutes prohibiting false factual statements have done, insist upon a showing that the false statement caused specific harm or at least was material, or focus its coverage on lies most likely to be harmful or on contexts where such lies are most likely to cause harm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI recognize that in some contexts, particularly political contexts, such a narrowing will not always be easy to achieve.  In the political arena a false statement is more likely to make a behavioral difference (say, by leading the listeners to vote for the speaker) but at the same time criminal prosecution is particularly dangerous (say, by radically changing a potential election result) and consequently can more easily result in censorship of speakers and their ideas.  Thus, the statute may have to be significantly narrowed in its applications.  Some lower courts have upheld the constitutionality of roughly comparable but narrowly tailored statutes in political contexts.  See, e.g., United We Stand America, Inc. v. United We Stand, America New York, Inc., 128 F.\xc2\xa03d 86, 93 (CA2 1997) (upholding against \n \nFirst Amendment challenge application of Lanham Act to a political organization); Treasure of the Committee to Elect Gerald D. Lostracco v. Fox, 150 Mich. App. 617, 389 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 446 (1986) (upholding under \n \nFirst Amendment statute prohibiting campaign material falsely claiming that one is an incumbent).  Without expressing any view on the validity of those cases, I would also note, like the plurality, that in this area more accurate information will normally counteract the lie.  And an accurate, publicly available register of military awards, easily obtainable by political opponents, may well adequately protect the integrity of an award against those who would falsely claim to have earned it.  See ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318.  And so it is likely that a more narrowly tailored statute combined with such information-disseminating devices will effectively serve Congress\xe2\x80\x99 end.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Government has provided no convincing explanation as to why a more finely tailored statute would not work.  In my own view, such a statute could significantly reduce the threat of \n \nFirst Amendment harm while permitting the statute to achieve its important protective objective.  That being so, I find the statute as presently drafted works disproportionate constitutional harm.  It consequently fails intermediate scrutiny, and so violates the \n \nFirst Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFor these reasons, I concur in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970528">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 11\xe2\x80\x93210\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tUNITED STATES, PETITIONER v.

Properly construed, this statute is limited in five significant respects.  First, the Act applies to only a narrow category of false representations about objective facts that can almost always be proved or disproved with near certainty.  Second, the Act concerns facts that are squarely within the speaker\xe2\x80\x99s personal knowledge.  Third, as the Government maintains, see Brief for United States 15\xe2\x80\x9317, and both the plurality, see ante, at 7, and the concurrence, see ante, at 3 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment), seemingly accept, a conviction under the Act requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the speaker actually knew that the representation was false.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Fourth, the Act applies only to statements that could reasonably be interpreted as communicating actual facts; it does not reach dramatic performances, satire, parody, hyperbole, or the like.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Finally, the Act is strictly viewpoint neutral.  The false statements proscribed by the Act are highly unlikely to be tied to any particular political or ideological message.  In the rare cases where that is not so, the Act applies equally to all false statements, whether they tend to disparage or commend the Government, the military, or the system of mil- itary honors.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Stolen Valor Act follows a long tradition of efforts to protect our country\xe2\x80\x99s system of military honors.

But much damage is caused, both to real award recipients and to the system of mili- tary honors, by false statements that are not linked to any financial or other tangible reward.  Unless even a small financial loss\xe2\x80\x94say, a dollar given to a homeless man falsely claiming to be a decorated veteran\xe2\x80\x94is more important in the eyes of the \n \nFirst Amendment than the damage caused to the very integrity of the military awards system, there is no basis for distinguishing between the Stolen Valor Act and the alternative statutes that the plurality and concurrence appear willing to sustain.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tJustice Breyer also proposes narrowing the statute so that it covers a shorter list of military awards, ante, at 9 (opinion concurring in judgment), but he does not provide a hint about where he thinks the line must be drawn.

And in Hill, supra, at 390, the Court concluded that the free speech right allows recovery for the even more modern tort of false-light invasion of privacy, see Prosser and Keeton \xc2\xa7117, at 863.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn line with these holdings, it has long been assumed that the \n \nFirst Amendment is not offended by prominent criminal statutes with no close common-law analog.  The most well known of these is probably \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71001, which makes it a crime to \xe2\x80\x9cknowingly and willfully\xe2\x80\x9d make any \xe2\x80\x9cmaterially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9cany matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Unlike perjury, \xc2\xa71001 is not limited to statements made under oath or before an official government tribunal.  Nor does it require any showing of \xe2\x80\x9cpecuniary or property loss to the government.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Gilliland, \n\n312 U.\xc2\xa0S. 86, \n93 (1941)\n.  Instead, the statute is based on the need to protect \xe2\x80\x9cagencies from the perversion which might result from the deceptive practices described.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.

See, e.g., \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7912 (making it a crime to falsely impersonate a federal officer); \xc2\xa7709 (making it a crime to knowingly use, without authorization, the names of enumerated federal agencies, such as \xe2\x80\x9cFederal Bureau of Investigation,\xe2\x80\x9d in a manner reasonably calculated to convey the impression that a communication is approved or authorized by the agency).  We have recognized that \xc2\xa7912, like \xc2\xa71001, does not require a showing of pecuniary or property loss and that its purpose is to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98maintain the general good repute and dignity\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of Government service.

But respondent\xe2\x80\x99s false claim to have received the Medal of Honor did not fall into any of these categories.

The lies covered by the Stolen Valor Act have no intrinsic value and thus merit no \n \nFirst Amendment protection unless their prohibition would chill other expression that falls within the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s scope.  I now turn to that question.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhile we have repeatedly endorsed the principle that false statements of fact do not merit \n \nFirst Amendment protection for their own sake, we have recognized that it is sometimes necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cexten[d] a measure of strategic protection\xe2\x80\x9d to these statements in order to ensure sufficient \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98breathing space\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d for protected speech.  Gertz, 418 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 342 (quoting NAACP v. Button, \n\n371 U.\xc2\xa0S. 415, \n433 (1963)\n).  Thus, in order to prevent the chilling of truthful speech on matters of public concern, we have held that liability for the defamation of a public official or figure requires proof that defamatory statements were made with knowledge or reckless disregard of their falsity.  See New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, \n\n376 U.\xc2\xa0S. 254\n\xe2\x80\x93280 (1964) (civil liability); Garrison, 379 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 74\xe2\x80\x9375 (criminal liability).  This same requirement applies when public officials and figures seek to recover for the tort of intentional infliction of emotional distress.  See Falwell, 485 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 55\xe2\x80\x9356.  And we have imposed \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xacting proof requirements\xe2\x80\x9d in other contexts as well when necessary to ensure that truthful speech is not chilled.  Madigan, 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 620 (complainant in a fraud action must show that the defendant made a knowingly false statement of material fact with the intent to mislead the listener and that he succeeded in doing so); see also BE&amp;K Constr., 536 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 531 (regulation of baseless lawsuits limited to those that are both \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively baseless and subjectively motivated by an unlawful purpose\xe2\x80\x9d); Hartlage, 456 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 61 (sustaining as-applied \n \nFirst Amendment challenge to law prohibiting certain \xe2\x80\x9cfactual misstatements in the course of political debate\xe2\x80\x9d where there had been no showing that the disputed statement was made \xe2\x80\x9cother than in good faith and without knowledge of its falsity, or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. with reckless disregard as to whether it was false or not\xe2\x80\x9d).  All of these proof requirements inevitably have the effect of bringing some false factual statements within the protection of the \n \nFirst Amendment, but this is justified in order to prevent the chilling of other, valuable speech.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThese examples by no means exhaust the circumstances in which false factual statements enjoy a degree of instrumental constitutional protection.  On the contrary, there are broad areas in which any attempt by the state to penalize purportedly false speech would present a grave and unacceptable danger of suppressing truthful speech.  Laws restricting false statements about philosophy, religion, history, the social sciences, the arts, and other matters of public concern would present such a threat.  The point is not that there is no such thing as truth or falsity in these areas or that the truth is always impossible to ascertain, but rather that it is perilous to permit the state to be the arbiter of truth.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven where there is a wide scholarly consensus concerning a particular matter, the truth is served by allowing that consensus to be challenged without fear of reprisal.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s accepted wisdom sometimes turns out to be mistaken.  And in these contexts, \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ven a false statement may be deemed to make a valuable contribution to public debate, since it brings about \xe2\x80\x98the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Sullivan, supra, at 279,  n.\xc2\xa019 (quoting J.

Statements about history illustrate this point.  If some false statements about historical events may be banned, how certain must it be that a statement is false before the ban may be upheld?  And who should make that calculation?  While our cases prohibiting viewpoint discrimination would fetter the state\xe2\x80\x99s power to some degree, see R. A. V. v. St. Paul, \n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377\n\xe2\x80\x93390 (1992) (explaining that the \n \nFirst Amendment does not permit the government to engage in viewpoint discrimination under the guise of regulating unprotected speech), the potential for abuse of power in these areas is simply too great.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn stark contrast to hypothetical laws prohibiting false statements about history, science, and similar matters, the Stolen Valor Act presents no risk at all that valuable speech will be suppressed.  The speech punished by the Act is not only verifiably false and entirely lacking in intrinsic value, but it also fails to serve any instrumen- tal purpose that the \n \nFirst Amendment might protect.  Tell- ingly, when asked at oral argument what truthful speech the Stolen Valor Act might chill, even respondent\xe2\x80\x99s counsel conceded that the answer is none.

Instead, those opinions appear to be based on the distinct concern that the Act suffers from overbreadth.  See ante, at 10 (plurality opinion) (the Act applies to \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal, whispered conversations within a home\xe2\x80\x9d); ante, at 8 (Breyer, J., concurring in judgment) (the Act \xe2\x80\x9capplies in family, social, or other private contexts\xe2\x80\x9d and in \xe2\x80\x9cpolitical contexts\xe2\x80\x9d).  But to strike down a statute on the basis that it is overbroad, it is necessary to show that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9coverbreadth [is] substantial, not only in an absolute sense, but also relative to [its] plainly legitimate sweep.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v.

The plurality apparently fears that we will see laws making it a crime to lie about civilian awards such as college degrees or certificates of achievement in the arts and sports.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis concern is likely unfounded.  With very good reason, military honors have traditionally been regarded as quite different from civilian awards.  Nearly a century ago, Congress made it a crime to wear a military medal without authorization; we have no comparable tradition regarding such things as Super Bowl rings, Oscars, or Phi Beta Kappa keys.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, if the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s concern is not entirely fanciful, it falls outside the purview of the \n \nFirst Amendment.  The problem that the plurality foresees\xe2\x80\x94that legislative bodies will enact unnecessary and overly intrusive criminal laws\xe2\x80\x94applies regardless of whether the laws in question involve speech or nonexpressive conduct.  If there is a problem with, let us say, a law making it a criminal offense to falsely claim to have been a high school valedictorian, the problem is not the suppression of speech but the misuse of the criminal law, which should be reserved for conduct that inflicts or threatens truly serious societal harm.  The objection to this hypothetical law would be the same as the objection to a law making it a crime to eat potato chips during the graduation ceremony at which the high school valedictorian is recognized.  The safeguard against such laws is democracy, not the \n \nFirst Amendment.  Not every foolish law is unconstitutional.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Stolen Valor Act represents the judgment of the people\xe2\x80\x99s elected representatives that false statements about military awards are very different from false statements about civilian awards.  Certainly this is true with respect to the high honor that respondent misappropri- ated.
