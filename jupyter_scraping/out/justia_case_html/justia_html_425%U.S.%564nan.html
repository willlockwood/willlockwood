CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER announced the judgment of the Court in an opinion in which MR. JUSTICE WHITE, MR. JUSTICE POWELL, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether the warnings called for by <em>Miranda v. Arizona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html">384 U. S. 436</a></span> (1966), must be given to a grand jury witness who is called to testify about criminal activities in which he may have been personally involved; and whether, absent such warnings, false statements made to the grand jury must be suppressed in a prosecution for perjury based on those statements.</p>\n<p><em>(1)\n</em></p>\n<p>During the course of a grand jury investigation into narcotics traffic in San Antonio, Tex., federal prosecutors assigned to the Drug Enforcement Administration Task Force learned of an undercover narcotics officer\'s encounter with respondent in March, 1973.  At that time, the agent had received information that respondent, who was employed as a bartender at a local tavern, was dealing in narcotics.  The agent, accompanied by an informant, met respondent at the tavern and talked for several hours.  During the meeting, respondent agreed to obtain heroin for the agent, and, to that end, placed several phone calls from the bar.  He also requested and received $650 from the agent to make the purchase.  Respondent left the tavern with the money so advanced to secure the heroin.  However, an hour later, respondent returned to the bar without the narcotics and returned the agent\'s money.  Respondent instructed the agent to telephone him at the bar that evening to make arrangements for the transaction.  The agent tried, but was unable to contact respondent as directed.  The record provides no explanation for respondent\'s failure to keep his appointment.  No further action was taken by the agent, and the investigatory file on the matter </p><p><a class="page-number" name="567">Page 425 U. S. 567</a></p><p> was closed.  The agent did, however, report the information to federal prosecutors.  At that time, the Government was seeking information on local drug traffic to present to a special grand jury investigating illicit traffic in the area.</p>\n<p>Respondent was subpoenaed to testify before the grand jury on ay 2, 1973; this was approximately six weeks after the abortive narcotics transaction at the tavern where respondent was employed.  When called into the grand jury room and after preliminary statements, the following colloquy occurred between the prosecutor and respondent:</p>\n<p>"Q.  . . .  Now, you are required to answer all the questions that I ask you except for the ones that you feel would tend to incriminate you.  Do you understand that?"</p>\n<p>"A. Do I answer all the questions you ask?"</p>\n<p>"Q. You have to answer all the questions except for those you think will incriminate you in the commission of a crime.  Is that clear?"</p>\n<p>"A. Yes, sir."</p>\n<p>"Q. You don\'t have to answer questions which would incriminate you.  All other questions you have to answer openly and truthfully.  And, of course, if you do not answer those [questions] truthfully, in other words if you lie about certain questions, you could possibly be charged with perjury.  Do you understand that?"</p>\n<p>"A. Yes, sir."</p>\n<p>"<em>*    *    *    *" </em></p>\n<p>"Q. Have you contacted a lawyer in this matter?"</p>\n<p>"A. I don\'t have one.  I don\'t have the money to get one."</p>\n<p>"Q. Well, if you would like to have a lawyer, he </p><p><a class="page-number" name="568">Page 425 U. S. 568</a></p><p> cannot be inside this room.  He can only be outside.  You would be free to consult with him if you so chose.  Now, if during the course of this investigation, the questions that we ask you, if you feel like you would like to have a lawyer outside to talk to, let me know."</p>\n<p>App. 5-6.</p>\n<p>During the questioning respondent admitted that he had previously been convicted of distributing drugs, that he had recently used heroin himself, and that he had purchased heroin as recently as five months previously.  Despite this admitted experience with San Antonio\'s heroin traffic, respondent denied knowledge of the identity of any dealers, save for a street corner source named Juan.  Respondent steadfastly denied either selling or attempting to sell heroin since the time of his conviction 15 years before.</p>\n<p>Respondent specifically disclaimed having discussed the sale of heroin with anyone during the preceding year and stated that he would not even try to purchase an ounce of heroin for $650.  Respondent refused to amplify on his testimony when directly confronted by the prosecutor:</p>\n<p>"Q. Mr. Mandujano, our information is that you can tell us more about the heroin business here in San Antonio than you have today.  Is there anything you would like to add telling us more about who sells heroin?"</p>\n<p>"A. Well, sir, I couldn\'t help you because, you know, I don\'t get along with the guys and I just can\'t tell you, you know."</p>\n<p>Following this appearance, respondent was charged by a grand jury on June 13, 1973, in a two-count indictment with attempting to distribute heroin in violation of 21 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 841(a)(1), 846, and for willfully and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="569">Page 425 U. S. 569</a></p><p> knowingly making a false material declaration to the grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1623. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The falsity of his statements was conceded; his sole claim was that the testimony before the grand jury should be suppressed because the Government failed to provide the warnings called for by <em>Miranda.</em>  Following an evidentiary hearing, the District Court granted respondent\'s motion to suppress.  The court held that respondent was a "putative" or "virtual" defendant when called before the grand jury; respondent had therefore been entitled to full <em>Miranda</em> warnings.  365 F.Supp. 155 (WD Tex.1973). [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals affirmed. 496 F.2d 1050 (CA5 1974).  It recognized that certain warnings had, in fact, been given to respondent at the outset of his grand jury appearance.  But the court agreed with the District Court that "full <em>Miranda</em> warnings should have been accorded Mandujano who was in the position of a virtual or putative defendant."  <em>Id.</em> at 1052.  The essence of the Court of Appeals\' holding is:</p>\n<p>"In order to deter the prosecuting officers from bringing a putative or virtual defendant before the grand jury, for the purpose of obtaining incriminating or </p><p><a class="page-number" name="570">Page 425 U. S. 570</a></p><p> perjur[i]ous testimony, the accused must be adequately apprised of his rights, <em>or all of his testimony, incriminating and perjur[i]ous, will be suppressed.</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1056. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>In so ruling, the court undertook to distinguish its own holding in <em>United States v. Orta,</em> 253 F.2d 312 (1958), in which Judge Rives, speaking for the court, stated:</p>\n<p>"[A grand jury witness] might answer truthfully and thereafter assert the constitutional guaranty.  <em>Under no circumstances, however, could he commit perjury and successfully claim that the Constitution afforded him protection from prosecution for that crime.</em>  As said in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/us/222/139/case.html">Glickstein v. United States,</a></span></em> [222 U.S. 139,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/us/222/139/case.html#142">222 U. S. 142</a></span> (1911),] \' . . . the immunity afforded by the constitutional guaranty relates to the past, and does not endow the person who testifies with a license to commit perjury.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 314.  (Emphasis added; citations omitted.)  In the <em>Orta</em> opinion, Judge Rives went on to observe:</p>\n<p>"The only debatable question is one of the supervision of the conduct of Government representatives in the interest of fairness.  In <em>United States v. Scully,</em> 2 Cir., 1955, 225 F.2d 113, 116, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held:"</p>\n<p>" . . . the mere possibility that the witness may later be indicated furnishes no basis for requiring that he be advised of his rights under the Fifth Amendment, when summoned to give testimony before a Grand Jury."</p>\n<p>"That holding is applicable to the present record.  There is no showing that the Grand Jury before which Orta testified was seeking to indict him or any other person already identified."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="571">Page 425 U. S. 571</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals concluded that the "totality of the circumstances" commanded suppression of all the testimony on which the charge of perjury rested.</p>\n<p>We agree with the views expressed by Judge Rives in <em>Orta, supra,</em> and disagree with the Court of Appeals in the instant case; accordingly, we reverse.</p>\n<p><em>(2)\n</em></p>\n<p>The grand jury is an integral part of our constitutional heritage which was brought to this country with the common law.  The Framers, most of them trained in the English law and traditions, accepted the grand jury as a basic guarantee of individual liberty; notwithstanding periodic criticism, much of which is superficial, overlooking relevant history, the grand jury continues to function as a barrier to reckless or unfounded charges.</p>\n<p>"Its adoption in our Constitution as the sole method for preferring charges in serious criminal cases shows the high place it held as an instrument of justice."</p>\n<p><em>Costello v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/359/case.html">350 U. S. 359</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/359/case.html#362">350 U. S. 362</a></span> (1956).  Its historic office has been to provide a shield against arbitrary or oppressive action, by insuring that serious criminal accusations will be brought only upon the considered judgment of a representative body of citizens acting under oath and under judicial instruction and guidance.</p>\n<p>Earlier we noted that the law vests the grand jury with substantial powers, because "[t]he grand jury\'s investigative power must be broad if its public responsibility is adequately to be discharged."  <em>United States v. Calandra,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html">414 U. S. 338</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#344">414 U. S. 344</a></span> (1974); <em>Branzburg v.

S. 700</a></span> (1972).  Indispensable to the exercise of its power is the authority to compel the attendance and the testimony of witnesses, <em>Kastigar v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/case.html">406 U. S. 441</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/441/case.html#443">406 U. S. 443</a></span> (1972), and to require the production of evidence, <em>United States v. White,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/322/694/case.html">322 U. S. 694</a></span> (1944). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="572">Page 425 U. S. 572</a></p><p></p>\n<p>When called by the grand jury, witnesses are thus legally bound to give testimony.  <em>Calandra, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#343">414 U. S. 343</a></span>. This principle has long been recognized.  In <em>United States v. Burr,</em> 25 F.Cas. 38 (No. 14,692e) (Va. 1807), Mr. Chief Justice Marshall drew on English precedents, aptly described by Lord Chancellor Hardwicke in the 18th century, and long accepted in America as a hornbook proposition:  "The public has a right to every man\'s evidence."  This Court has repeatedly invoked this fundamental proposition when dealing with the powers of the grand jury.  <em>United States v. Nixon,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html">418 U. S. 683</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/683/case.html#709">418 U. S. 709</a></span> (1974); <em>Branzburg v. Hayes, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/665/case.html#688">408 U. S. 688</a></span>; <em>Kastigar v.

S. 432</a></span> (1943) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>The grand jury\'s authority to compel testimony is not, of course, without limits.  The same Amendment that establishes the grand jury also guarantees that "no person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself. . . ."  The duty to give evidence to a grand jury is therefore conditional; every person owes society his testimony, unless some recognized privilege is asserted.</p>\n<p>Under settled principles, the Fifth Amendment does not confer an absolute right to decline to respond in a grand jury inquiry; the privilege does not negate the duty to testify, but simply conditions that duty.  The privilege cannot, for example, be asserted by a witness to protect others from possible criminal prosecution.  <em>Rogers v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/367/case.html">340 U. S. 367</a></span> (1951); <em>United States v. Murdock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/284/141/case.html">284 U. S. 141</a></span> (1931); <em>Hale v. Henkel,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/201/43/case.html">201 U. S. 43</a></span> (1906).  Nor can it be invoked simply to protect the witness\' interest in privacy.  "Ordinarily, of course, a witness has no right of privacy before the grand jury."  <em>Calandra, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/case.html#353">414 U. S. 353</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="573">Page 425 U. S. 573</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The very availability of the Fifth Amendment privilege to grand jury witnesses, recognized by this Court in <em>Counselman v. Hitchcock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/547/case.html">142 U. S. 547</a></span> (1892), suggests that occasions will often arise when potentially incriminating questions will be asked in the ordinary course of the jury\'s investigation.  Probing questions to all types of witnesses is the stuff that grand jury investigations are made of; the grand jury\'s mission is, after all, to determine whether to make a presentment or return an indictment.</p>\n<p>"The basic purpose of the English grand jury was to provide a fair method for instituting criminal proceedings against persons believed to have committed crimes."</p>\n<p><em>Costello v. United States, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/350/359/case.html#362">350 U. S. 362</a></span>.</p>\n<p>It is in keeping with the grand jury\'s historic function as a shield against arbitrary accusations to call before it persons suspected of criminal activity, so that the investigation can be complete.  This is true whether the grand jury embarks upon an inquiry focused upon individuals suspected of wrongdoing, or is directed at persons suspected of no misconduct but who may be able to provide links in a chain of evidence relating to criminal conduct of others, or is centered upon broader problems of concern to society.  It is entirely appropriate -- indeed imperative -- to summon individuals who may be able to illuminate the shadowy precincts of corruption and crime.  Since the subject matter of the inquiry is crime, and often organized, systematic crime -- as is true with drug traffic -- it is unrealistic to assume that all of the witnesses capable of providing useful information will be pristine pillars of the community untainted by criminality.</p>\n<p>The Court has never ignored this reality of law enforcement.  Speaking for the Court in <em>Kastigar v. United States,</em> MR. JUSTICE POWELL said:</p>\n<p>"[M]any offenses are of such a character that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="574">Page 425 U.

In one of the early cases dealing with the Fifth Amendment privilege, the Court observed:  "[I]t is only from the mouths of those having knowledge of the [unlawful conduct] that the facts can be ascertained."  <em>Brown v.

If the witness interposes his privilege, the grand jury has two choices.  If the desired testimony is of marginal value, the grand jury can pursue other avenues of inquiry; if the testimony is thought sufficiently important, the grand jury can seek a judicial determination as to the <em>bona fides</em> of the witness\' Fifth Amendment claim, <em>Malloy v.

On the other hand, when granted immunity, a witness once again owes the obligation imposed upon all citizens -- the duty to give testimony -- since immunity substitutes for the privilege.\n</em></p>\n<p>In this constitutional process of securing a witness\' testimony, perjury simply has no place whatever.  Perjured testimony is an obvious and flagrant affront to the basic concepts of judicial proceedings.  Effective restraints against this type of egregious offense are therefore imperative.  The power of subpoena, broad as it is, and the power of contempt for refusing to answer, drastic as that is -- and even the solemnity of the oath -- cannot insure truthful answers.  Hence, Congress has made the giving of false answers a criminal act punishable by severe penalties; in no other way can criminal conduct be flushed into the open where the law can deal with it.

S. 577</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Similarly, our cases have consistently -- indeed, without exception -- allowed sanctions for false statements or perjury; they have done so even in instances where the perjurer complained that the Government exceeded its constitutional powers in making the inquiry.  <em>See, e.g., United States v.

In a collateral attack on his conviction, Bryson argued that, since the statute required him either to incriminate himself or lie, he could not lawfully be imprisoned for failure to comply.  This Court rejected the contention:</p>\n<p>"[I]t cannot be thought that as a general principle of our law a citizen has a privilege to answer fraudulently a question that the Government should not have asked.

The court reached this result because the prosecutor failed to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings at the outset of Mandujano\'s interrogation.  Those warnings were required, in the Court of Appeals\' view, because Mandujano was a "virtual" or "putative" defendant -- that is, the prosecutor had specific information concerning Mandujano\'s participation in an attempted sale of heroin and the focus of the grand jury interrogation, as evidenced by the prosecutor\'s questions, centered on Mandujano\'s involvement in narcotics traffic.  The fundamental error of the prosecutor, in the court\'s view, was to treat respondent in such a way as to "<em>smack\' of entrapment"; as a consequence, the court concluded that "elemental fairness" required the perjured </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="579">Page 425 U. S. 579</a></em></p><p><em> testimony.to be suppressed.  496 F.2d at 1058, and n. 8.\n</em></p>\n<p>The court\'s analysis, premised upon the prosecutor\'s failure to give <em>Miranda</em> warnings, erroneously applied the standards fashioned by this Court in <em>Miranda.</em>  Those warnings [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] were aimed at the evils seen by the Court as endemic to police interrogation of a person in custody. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  <em>Miranda</em> addressed extrajudicial confessions or admissions procured in a hostile, unfamiliar environment which lacked procedural safeguards.  The decision expressly rested on the privilege against compulsory self-incrimination; the prescribed warnings sought to negate the "compulsion" thought to be inherent in police station interrogation.  But the <em>Miranda</em> Court simply did not perceive judicial inquiries and custodial interrogation as equivalents:</p>\n<p>"[T]he compulsion to speak in the isolated setting of the police station may well be greater than in courts or other official investigations, where there are often impartial observers to guard against intimidation or trickery."</p>\n<p>384 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#461">384 U.

Indeed, the Court\'s opinion in <em>Miranda</em> reveals a focus on what was seen by the Court as police "coercion" derived from</p>\n<p>"factual studies [relating to] police violence and the \'third degree\' . . . physical brutality -- beating, hanging, whipping -- and to sustained and protracted questioning incommunicado in order to extort confessions. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/case.html#445">384 U.

To extend these concepts to questioning before a grand jury inquiring into criminal activity under the guidance of a judge is an extravagant expansion never remotely contemplated by this Court in <em>Miranda,</em> the dynamics of constitutional interpretation do not compel constant extension of every doctrine announced by the Court.</p>\n<p>The marked contrasts between a grand jury investigation and custodial interrogation have been commented on by the Court from time to time.  MR. JUSTICE MARSHALL observed that the broad coercive powers of a grand jury are justified, because, " -- in contrast to the police -- it is not likely that [the grand jury] will abuse those powers."  <em>United States v. Mara,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/19/case.html">410 U. S. 19</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/19/case.html#46">410 U.

To extend the concepts of <em>Miranda,</em> as contemplated by the Court of Appeals, would require that the witness be told that there was an absolute right to silence, and obviously any such warning would be incorrect, for there is no such right before a grand jury.  Under <em>Miranda,</em> a person in police custody has, of course, an absolute right to decline </p><p><a class="page-number" name="581">Page 425 U.

S. 96</a></span> (1975), whereas a grand jury witness, on the contrary, has an absolute duty to answer all questions, subject only to a valid Fifth Amendment claim.  And even when the grand jury witness asserts the privilege, questioning need not cease, except as to the particular subject to which the privilege has been addressed.  <em>Cf. id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/96/case.html#103">423 U.

Other lines of inquiry may properly be pursued.</p>\n<p>Respondent was also informed that, if he desired, he could have the assistance of counsel, but that counsel could not be inside the grand jury room.  That statement was plainly a correct recital of the law.  No criminal proceedings had been instituted against respondent; hence, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not come into play.  <em>Kirby v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/case.html">406 U. S. 682</a></span> (1972).

Since respondent was already under oath to testify truthfully, this explanation was redundant; it served simply to emphasize the obligation already imposed by the oath.</p>\n<p>"Once a witness swears to give truthful answers, <em>there is no requirement to \'warn him not to commit perjury or, conversely to direct him to tell the truth.\'</em>  It would render the sanctity of the oath quite meaningless </p><p><a class="page-number" name="582">Page 425 U.

Nickels,</em> 502 F.2d 1173, 1176 (CA7 1974).</p>\n<p>Similarly, a witness subpoenaed to testify before a petit jury and placed under oath has never been entitled to a warning that, if he violates the solemn oath to "tell the truth," he may be subject to a prosecution for perjury, for the oath itself is the warning.  Nor has any case been cited to us holding that the absence of such warnings before a petit jury provides a shield against use of false testimony in a subsequent prosecution for perjury or in contempt proceedings. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>In any event, a witness sworn to tell the truth before a duly constituted grand jury will not be heard to call for suppression of false statements made to that jury, any more than would be the case with false testimony before a petit jury or other duly constituted tribunal.

It is no less clear, however, that the grand jury, as with all institutions of Government, is subject to the fundamental restraints which guarantee our liberty, including the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination.  <em>Counselman v. Hitchcock,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/142/547/case.html">142 U. S. 547</a></span> (1892).  And, in delineating the scope and operation of the Fifth Amendment privilege necessary to secure its fundamental policies in the grand jury context, we must note that the nature of the grand jury is, of course, primarily inquisitional, rather than adversary:  the grand jury is "a grand inquest, . . . with powers of investigation and inquisition."  <em>Blair v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/250/273/case.html">250 U.

Given this characterizing principle, we are alerted to the danger that, in the absence of a subtle and flexible mode of constitutional analysis -- an analysis certainly not illustrated in the <em>Monia</em> dictum -- the fundamentals of the Fifth Amendment privilege may be subverted by talismanic invocation of the role of the grand jury in our constitutional system.  A more discriminating analysis is fully in keeping with the historic role of this Court, for, as said by Mr. Chief Justice Marshall in the identical context of conflict between the role of the grand jury and the Fifth Amendment privilege:</p>\n<p>"When two principles come in conflict with each other, the court must give them both a reasonable construction, so as to preserve them both to a reasonable extent."</p>\n<p><em>United States v. Burr,</em> 25 F.Cas. 38, 39 (No. 14,692e) (CC Va. 1807). [<a href="#F2/6" name="T2/6">Footnote 2/6</a>]  Close </p><p><a class="page-number" name="591">Page 425 U.

S. 445</a></span> (1972).</p>\n<p>In my view, the conception of the Fifth Amendment privilege expressed in the <em>Monia</em> dictum is explainable only by reference to the facts and circumstances of the only case cited in support by <em>Monia</em> -- <em>United States ex rel. Vajtauer v. Commissioner of Immigration,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/103/case.html">273 U. S. 103</a></span> (1927).  That case involved questions concerning the Fifth Amendment privilege in a deportation proceeding.  In holding that the prospective deportee\'s privilege against compulsory self-incrimination had not been violated in the circumstances, the Court rested on the failure to assert any claim of privilege in the proceeding.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/273/113/case.html">273 U. S. 113</a></span>.  Essential to the Court\'s holding was the observation:</p>\n<p>"It is for the tribunal conducting the trial to determine what weight should be given to the contention of the witness that the answer sought will incriminate him, . . . a determination which it cannot make if not advised of the contention. . . .  The privilege may not be relied on, and must be deemed waived if not in some manner fairly brought to the attention of the tribunal which must pass upon it."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  It is only in a context where this "lack of notice on the part of the government" rationale has significance that we can possibly justify the <em>Monia</em> dictum that a witness testifying under judicial compulsion -- that classic form of compulsion to which the Fifth Amendment is centrally </p><p><a class="page-number" name="592">Page 425 U. S. 592</a></p><p> addressed [<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>] -- must claim the privilege or else, without any further analysis, "he will not be considered to have been <em>compelled\' within the meaning of the Amendment."  317 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/317/424/case.html#427">317 U. S. 427</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/8" name="T2/8">Footnote 2/8</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p>This view of the nature and scope of the Fifth Amendment privilege was reaffirmed by the Court this very Term:</p>\n<p>"Unless the Government seeks testimony that will subject its giver to criminal liability, the constitutional right to remain silent absent immunity does not arise.  An individual therefore properly may be compelled to give testimony, for example, in a noncriminal investigation of himself. . . .  Unless a witness objects, a government <em>ordinarily may assume</em> that its compulsory processes are not eliciting testimony that he deems to be incriminating.  Only the witness knows whether the <em>apparently innocent</em> disclosure </p><p><a class="page-number" name="593">Page 425 U. S. 593</a></p><p> sought may incriminate him, and the burden appropriately lies with him to make a timely assertion of the privilege. . . ."</p>\n<p>"In addition, the rule that a witness must claim the privilege is consistent with the fundamental purpose of the Fifth Amendment -- the preservation of an adversary system of criminal justice. . . .  <em>That system is undermined when a government deliberately seeks to avoid the burdens of independent investigation by compelling self-incrimination disclosures.</em>  In areas where a government cannot be said to be compelling such information, however, there is no such circumvention of the constitutionally mandated policy of adversary criminal proceedings."</p>\n<p><em>Garner v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html">424 U.

Indeed, in the situation where a prior claim is excused and a knowing and completely voluntary waiver of the privilege is required -- the situation of the <em>Miranda</em>-type custodial interrogation -- the reason is that "the inquiring government is <em>acutely aware</em> of the potentially incriminatory nature of the disclosures sought."  <em>Garner, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#657">424 U. S. 657</a></span> (emphasis added).  Similarly, the prior claim is excused in the <em>Marchetti-Grosso</em> [<a href="#F2/9" name="T2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>] situation, and the privilege confers an absolute right not to file an information return required by the government precisely because the required filing is directed to a class of persons "the great majority of whom [are] likely to incriminate themselves by responding," <em>Garner, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#660">424 U. S. 660</a></span>, and, therefore, "as in the coerced confession cases, any compulsion to disclose [is] likely to compel self-incrimination."  <em>Ibid.</em>  I submit that this more discriminating analysis is also required in the situation in which </p><p><a class="page-number" name="594">Page 425 U. S. 594</a></p><p> a putative or <em>de facto</em> defendant is called to testify under judicial compulsion before a grand jury; otherwise, we countenance a serious erosion of fundamental guarantees of the Constitution.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>It is clear that the government may not, in the absence of an intentional and knowing waiver, call an indicated defendant before a grand jury and there interrogate him concerning the subject matter of a crime for which he already stands formally charged.  <em>Lawn v.

[<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  There can be no doubt that sanctioning unfettered discretion in prosecutors to delay the seeking of criminal indictments pending the calling of criminal suspects before grand juries to be interrogated under conditions of judicial compulsion runs the grave risk of allowing "the prosecution [to] evade its own constitutional restrictions on its powers by turning the grand jury into its agent."  <em>United States v.

Where such prosecutorial tactics are employed, it borders on the absurd to say, as is said in justification of the <em>Monia</em> dictum, that the "government . . . may assume that its compulsory processes are not eliciting" incriminating information, <em>Garner,</em> 424 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/424/648/case.html#655">424 U.

Such a waiver could readily be demonstrated by proof that the individual was warned prior to questioning that he is currently subject to possible criminal prosecution for the commission of a stated crime, that he has a constitutional right to refuse to answer any and all questions that may tend to incriminate him, and by record evidence that the individual understood the nature of his situation and privilege prior to giving testimony.</p>\n<p>"Some courts have reasoned that, because of the investigative function and inquisitorial nature of the grand jury, it cannot be burdened with affording a witness the full panoply of procedural safeguards.

And plainly the requirements of an effective warning and an intelligent waiver by a putative defendant prior to attempts to elicit potentially incriminating information impose no onerous duty on the prosecutor.  The reported decisions of the lower federal courts are replete with examples of prosecuting officials proffering such warnings as an essential element of our fundamental liberties.

That statement was plainly a correct recital of the law.  No criminal proceedings had been instituted against respondent; hence, the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not come into play."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/425/564/case.html#581">425 U.

A citizen may decline to answer the question, or answer it honestly, but he cannot with impunity knowingly and willfully answer with a falsehood."</p>\n<p><em>Bryson v.

The respondent\'s grand jury testimony is relevant only to his prosecution for perjury, and was not introduced in the prosecution for attempting to distribute heroin.
