The Government declined to exercise its statutory right to intervene, the District Court dismissed the complaint and entered judgment for respondents, and petitioner filed a notice of appeal 54 days later.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A) and 28 U.

Indeed, intervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party.  See<em> Marino</em> v. <em>Ortiz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/301/index.html">484 U. S. 301</a>, 304.  To hold otherwise would render the FCA\xe2\x80\x99s intervention provisions superfluous, contradicting the requirement that statutes be construed in a manner that gives effect to all their provisions, see, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U.

The FCA expressly gave the United States discretion to intervene in FCA actions, and the Court cannot disregard that congressional assignment of discretion by designating the United States a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d even after it has declined to assume the rights and burdens attendant to full party status.

Second, the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive pleadings and deposition transcripts when it declines to intervene, see \xc2\xa73730(c)(3), does not support, but weighs against, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument: If the United States were a party to every FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such materials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\xc2\xa05.  Third, the fact that the United States is bound by the judgment in all FCA actions regardless of its participation in the case is not a legitimate basis for disregarding the statute\xe2\x80\x99s intervention scheme.  Finally, given that Rule 4(a)(1)(B) hinges its 60-day time limit on the United States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d status, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the limit\xe2\x80\x99s underlying purpose would be best served by applying it in every FCA case is unavailing.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73729.  The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that the 30-day limit applies.  We affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Irwin Eisenstein and four New York City (City) employees filed this lawsuit against the City to challenge a fee charged by the City to nonresident workers.  They contended, <em>inter alia</em>, that the City deprived the United States of tax revenue that it otherwise would have received if the fee had not been deducted as an expense from the workers\xe2\x80\x99 taxable income.  In their view, this violated the FCA, which creates civil liability for \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person who knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, to an officer or employee of the United States Government \xe2\x80\xa6 a false or fraudulent claim for payment or approval.\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73729(a)(1).  Although the United States is a \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d in a case brought under the FCA, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa017(a), an FCA action does not need to be brought by the United States.  The FCA also allows \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person [to] bring a civil action for a violation of section 3729 for the person and for the United States Government,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(b)(1).  In a case brought by a person rather than the United States, the FCA grants the United States 60 days to review the claim and decide whether it will \xe2\x80\x9celect to intervene and proceed with the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73730(b)(2).  After reviewing the complaint in this case, the United States declined to intervene but requested continued service of the pleadings.  The United States took no other action with respect to the litigation.  The District Court subsequently granted respondents\xe2\x80\x99 motion to dismiss the complaint and entered final judgment in their favor.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner filed a notice of appeal 54 days later.  While the appeal was pending, the Court of Appeals <em>sU. S.onte </em>ordered the parties to brief the issue whether the notice of appeal had been timely filed.  Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1)(A)\xe2\x80\x93(B) and 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72107(a)\xe2\x80\x93(b) generally require that a notice of appeal be filed within 30 days of the entry of judgment but extend the period to 60 days when \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72107(b).  Petitioner argued that his appeal was timely filed under the 60-day limit because the United States is a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to every FCA suit.  Respondents countered that the appeal was untimely under the 30-day limit because the United States is not a party to an FCA action absent formal intervention or other meaningful participation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals agreed with respondents that the 30-day limit applied and dismissed the appeal as untimely.  See 540 F.\xc2\xa03d 94 (CA2 2008).  We granted certiorari, 555 U. S. ___ (2009), to resolve division in the courts of appeals on the question,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A party has 60 days to file a notice of appeal if \xe2\x80\x9cthe United States or an officer or agency thereof is a party\xe2\x80\x9d to the action.

Although the United States is aware of and minimally involved in every FCA action, we hold that it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to an FCA action for purposes of the appellate filing deadline unless it has exercised its right to intervene in the case.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCA establishes a scheme that permits either the Attorney General, \xc2\xa73730(a), or a private party, \xc2\xa73730(b), to initiate a civil action alleging fraud on the Government.  A private enforcement action under the FCA is called a <em>qui tam</em> action, with the private party referred to as the \xe2\x80\x9crelator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</em> v. <em>United States ex rel. Stevens</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/529/765/index.html">529 U. S. 765</a>, 769 (2000).  When a relator initiates such an action, the United States is given 60 days to review the claim and decide whether it will \xe2\x80\x9celect to intervene and proceed with the action,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa73730(b)(2), 3730(b)(4); see also \xc2\xa73730(c)(3) (permitting the United States to intervene even after the expiration of the 60-day period \xe2\x80\x9cupon a showing of good cause\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the United States intervenes, the relator has \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to continue as a party to the action,\xe2\x80\x9d but the United States acquires the \xe2\x80\x9cprimary responsibility for prosecuting the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73730(c)(1).  If the United States declines to intervene, the relator retains \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to conduct the action.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa73730(c)(3).  The United States is thereafter limited to exercising only specific rights during the proceeding.  These rights include requesting service of pleadings and deposition transcripts, \xc2\xa73730(c)(3), seeking to stay discovery that \xe2\x80\x9cwould interfere with the Government\xe2\x80\x99s investigation or prosecution of a criminal or civil matter arising out of the same facts,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa73730(c)(4), and vetoing a relator\xe2\x80\x99s decision to voluntarily dismiss the action, \xc2\xa73730(b)(1).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner nonetheless asserts that the Government is a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to the action even when it has not exercised its right to intervene.  We disagree.  A \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to litigation is \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ne by or against whom a lawsuit is brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 1154 (8th ed. 2004).  An individual may also become a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to a lawsuit by intervening in the action.  See <em>id.</em>, at 840 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cintervention\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he legal procedure by which \xe2\x80\xa6 a third party is allowed to become a party to the litigation\xe2\x80\x9d).  As the Court long ago explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0[w]hen the term [to intervene] is used in reference to legal proceedings, it covers the right of one to interpose in, <em>or become a party to</em>, a proceeding already instituted.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Rocca</em> v. <em>Thompson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/223/317/index.html">223 U. S. 317</a>, 330 (1912) (emphasis added).  The Court has further indicated that intervention is the requisite method for a nonparty to become a party to a lawsuit.  See<em> Marino</em> v. <em>Ortiz</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/484/301/index.html"></a><a href="/us/484/301/index.html">484 U. S. 301</a>, 304 (1988) <em>(per curiam) </em>(holding that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen [a] nonparty has an interest that is affected by the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment \xe2\x80\xa6 the better practice is for such a nonparty <em>to seek intervention </em>for purposes of appeal\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9conly parties to a lawsuit, or those that properly become parties, may appeal an adverse judgment\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added)).  The United States, therefore, is a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to a privately filed FCA action only if it intervenes in accordance with the procedures established by federal law.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To hold otherwise would render the intervention provisions of the FCA superfluous, as there would be no reason for the United States to intervene in an action in which it is already a party.  Such a holding would contradict well-established principles of statutory interpretation that require statutes to be construed in a manner that gives effect to all of their provisions.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Cooper Industries, Inc.</em> v. <em>Aviall Services, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/157/index.html">543 U. S. 157</a>, 166 (2004); <em>Dole Food Co.</em> v. <em>Patrickson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/468/index.html">538 U. S. 468</a>, 476\xe2\x80\x93477 (2003).  Congress expressly gave the United States discretion to intervene in FCA actions\xe2\x80\x94a decision that requires consideration of the costs and benefits of party status.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa026(a) (requiring a party to disclose certain information without awaiting any discovery request); Rule\xc2\xa034 (imposing obligations on parties served with requests for production of information); Rule 37 (providing for sanctions for noncompliance with certain party obligations).  The Court cannot disregard that congressional assignment of discretion by designating the United States a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d even after it has declined to assume the rights and burdens attendant to full party status.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that the United States should be designated a party in all FCA actions irrespective of its decision to intervene are unconvincing.  First, petitioner points to the United States\xe2\x80\x99 status as a \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d in an FCA action and its right to a share of any resulting damages.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa017(a); <em>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources, supra,</em> at 772; see also 6A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71545, pp. 351\xe2\x80\x93353 (2d ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen there has been \xe2\x80\xa6 a partial assignment the assignor and the assignee each retain an interest in the claim and are both real parties in interest\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the United States\xe2\x80\x99 status as a \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d in a <em>qui tam </em>action does not automatically convert it into a \xe2\x80\x9cparty.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The phrase, \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest,\xe2\x80\x9d is a term of art utilized in federal law to refer to an actor with a substantive right whose interests may be represented in litigation by another.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Fed. Rule Civ. Proc.\xc2\xa017(a); see also Cts. Crim. App. Rule Prac. &amp; Proc. 20(b), 44 M.\xc2\xa0J. lxxii (1996) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhen an accused has not been named as a party, the accused \xe2\x80\xa6 shall be designated as the real party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary, <em>supra,</em> at 1154 (defining a \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[a] person entitled under the substantive law to enforce the right sued upon and who generally \xe2\x80\xa6 benefits from the action\xe2\x80\x99s final outcome\xe2\x80\x9d).  Congress\xe2\x80\x99 choice of the term \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d in Rule 4(a)(1)(B) and \xc2\xa72107(b), and not the distinctive phrase, \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest,\xe2\x80\x9d indicates that the 60-day time limit applies only when the United States is an actual \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>qui tam</em> actions\xe2\x80\x94and not when the United States holds the status of \xe2\x80\x9creal party in interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Sigmon Coal Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/534/438/index.html">534 U. S. 438</a>, 452 (2002) (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  Consequently, when, as here, a real party in interest has declined to bring the action or intervene, there is no basis for deeming it a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We likewise reject petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s related claim that the United States\xe2\x80\x99 party status for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B) is controlled by the statutory requirement that an FCA action be \xe2\x80\x9cbrought in the name of the Government.\xe2\x80\x9d  31 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73730(b)(1).  A person or entity can be named in the caption of a complaint without necessarily becoming a party to the action.  See 5A C. Wright &amp; A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71321, p. 388 (3d ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he caption is not determinative as to the identity of the parties to the action\xe2\x80\x9d).  And here, it would make little sense to interpret the naming requirement of \xc2\xa73730(b)(1) to dispense with the specific procedures for intervention provided elsewhere in the statute.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, petitioner relies on the Government\xe2\x80\x99s right to receive pleadings and deposition transcripts in cases where it declines to intervene, see \xc2\xa73730(c)(3). But the existence of this right, if anything, weighs against petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument.  If the United States were a party to every FCA suit, it would already be entitled to such materials under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\xc2\xa05, thus leaving no need for a separate provision preserving this basic right of litigation for the Government.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Third, petitioner relies on the fact that the United States is bound by the judgment in all FCA actions regardless of its participation in the case.  But this fact is not determinative; nonparties may be bound by a judgment for a host of different reasons.  See <em>Taylor </em>v. <em>Sturgell</em>, 553 U. S. ___, ___ (2008) (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9314) (describing \xe2\x80\x9csix established categories\xe2\x80\x9d in which a nonparty may be bound by a judgment); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa741(1)(d), p. 393 (1980) (noting that a nonparty may be bound by a judgment obtained by a party who, <em>inter alia</em>, is \xe2\x80\x9can official or agency invested by law with authority to represent the person\xe2\x80\x99s interests\xe2\x80\x9d).  If the United States believes that its rights are jeopardized by an ongoing <em>qui tam</em> action, the FCA provides for intervention\xe2\x80\x94including \xe2\x80\x9cfor good cause shown\xe2\x80\x9d after the expiration of the 60-day review period.  The fact that the Government is bound by the judgment is not a legitimate basis for disregarding this statutory scheme.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner contends that the underlying purpose of the 60-day time limit would be best served by applying Rule 4(a)(1)(B) in every FCA case.  The purpose of the extended 60-day limit in cases where the United States is a party, he claims, is to provide the Government with sufficient time to review a case and decide whether to appeal.  Petitioner contends that, even in cases where the Government did not intervene before the district court issued its decision, the Government may want to intervene for purposes of appeal, and should have the full 60 days to decide.  But regardless of the purpose of Rule 4(a)(1)(B) and the convenience that additional time may provide to the Government, this Court cannot ignore the Rule\xe2\x80\x99s text, which hinges the applicability of the 60-day period on the requirement that the United States be a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to the action.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We hold that when the United States has declined to intervene in a privately initiated FCA action, it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d to the litigation for purposes of either \xc2\xa72107 or Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure\xc2\xa04.

There, the Court held that in a class-action suit, a class member who was not a named party in the litigation could appeal the approval of a settlement without formally intervening.  See <em>id.</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x9314.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling was premised on the class-action nature of the suit, see <em>id.</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, and specifically noted that party status depends on \xe2\x80\x9cthe applicability of various procedural rules that may differ based on context,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 10.  For the reasons explained above, we conclude that in the specific context of the FCA, intervention is necessary for the United States to obtain status as a \xe2\x80\x9cparty\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of Rule 4(a)(1)(B).</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Petitioner contends that the uncertainty regarding Rule\xc2\xa04(a)(1)(B) has created a \xe2\x80\x9ctra[p] for the unwary,\xe2\x80\x9d and that our decision will unfairly punish those who relied on the holdings of courts adopting the 60-day limit in cases in which the United States was not a party.  See Brief for Petitioner 25\xe2\x80\x9327.  As an initial matter, it is unclear how many pending cases are implicated by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s concern as such cases would have to involve parties who waited more than 30 days to appeal from the judgment in an FCA case in which the United States declined to intervene.  But to the extent that there are such cases, the Court must nonetheless decide the jurisdictional question before it irrespective of the possibility of harsh consequences.
