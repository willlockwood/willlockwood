Md.Laws 1949, c. 86, \xc2\xa7 15, 78 A.2d 660.  The scope of the State law was passed on in <em>Shub v. Simpson,</em> ___ Md. ___, 76 A.2d 332.  We read this decision to hold that to obtain a place on a Maryland ballot a candidate need only make oath that he is not a person who is engaged "in one way or another in the attempt </p><p><a class="page-number" name="57">Page 341 U. S. 57</a></p><p> to overthrow the government by force or violence," and that he is not knowingly a member of an organization engaged in such an attempt. 76 A.2d at 338.  At the bar of this Court, the Attorney General of the Maryland declared that he would advise the proper authorities to accept an affidavit in these terms as satisfying in full the statutory requirement.  Under these circumstances, and with this understanding, the judgment of the Maryland Court of Appeals is</p>\n<p><em>Affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REED concurs in the result.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
