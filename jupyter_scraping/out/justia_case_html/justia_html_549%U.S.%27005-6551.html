Under California\xe2\x80\x99s determinate sentencing law (DSL), that offense is punishable by one of three precise terms of imprisonment: a lower term sentence of 6 years, a middle term sentence of 12 years, or an upper term sentence of 16 years.  The DSL obliged the trial judge to sentence Cunningham to the 12-year middle term unless the judge found one or more additional \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances in aggravation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Court Rules adopted to implement the DSL define \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstances in aggravation\xe2\x80\x9d as facts that justify the upper term.  Those facts, the Rules provide, must be established by a preponderance of the evidence.  Based on a post-trial sentencing hearing, the judge found by a preponderance of the evidence six aggravating facts, including the particular vulnerability of the victim, and one mitigating fact, that Cunningham had no record of prior criminal conduct.  Concluding that the aggravators outweighed the sole mitigator, the judge sentenced Cunningham to the upper term of 16 years.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed.  The State Supreme Court denied review, but in a decision published nine days earlier, <em>People </em>v.<em> Black,</em> 35 Cal 4th 1230, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 534,<em> </em>that court held that the DSL survived Sixth Amendment inspection.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge\xe2\x80\x99s province, violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9322.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0In <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey</em>, this Court held that, under the Sixth Amendment, any fact (other than a prior conviction) that exposes a defendant to a sentence in excess of the relevant statutory maximum must be found by a jury, not a judge, and established beyond a reasonable doubt, not merely by a preponderance of the evidence.  See <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a>, 490.  The Court has applied the rule of <em>Apprendi</em> to facts subjecting a defendant to the death penalty, <em>Ring</em> v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/584/index.html">536 U. S. 584</a>, 602, 609, facts permitting a sentence in excess of the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard range\xe2\x80\x9d under Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act), <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, 304\xe2\x80\x93305, and facts triggering a sentence range elevation under the then-mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U. S. 220</a>, 243\xe2\x80\x93244.  <em>Blakely</em> and <em>Booker</em> bear most closely on the question presented here.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The maximum penalty for Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s offense, under Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Reform Act, was ten years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, but if no facts beyond those reflected in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict were found by the trial judge, Blakely could not receive a sentence above a standard range of 49 to 53 months.  Blakely was sentenced to 90 months, more than three years above the standard range, based on the judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding of deliberate cruelty.  Applying <em>Apprendi, </em>this Court held the sentence unconstitutional.  The State in <em>Blakely</em> endeavored to distinguish <em>Apprendi</em>, contending that Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was within the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion based solely on the guilty verdict.  The Court dismissed that argument.  Blakely could not have been sentenced above the standard range absent an additional fact.  Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee.  It did not matter that Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, though outside the standard range, was within the 10-year maximum.  Because the judge could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range\xe2\x80\x9453 months, not 10 years\xe2\x80\x94was the relevant statutory maximum.  The Court also rejected the State\xe2\x80\x99s arguments that <em>Apprendi</em> was satisfied because the Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of facts on which a judge might base a departure from the standard range, and because it ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Booker was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The facts found by the jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed without undertaking additional factfinding.  The judge did so, making a finding that boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range.  This Court held Booker\xe2\x80\x99s sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amendment.  There was \xe2\x80\x9cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in <em>[Blakely].</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 233.  Both were \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  All Members of the Court agreed, however, that the Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amendment if they were advisory.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Facing the remedial question, the Court concluded that rendering the Guidelines advisory came closest to what Congress would have intended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth Amendment challenge.  Under the advisory Guidelines system described in <em>Booker,</em> judges would no longer be confined to the sentencing range dictated by the Guidelines, but would be obliged to \xe2\x80\x9ctake account\xe2\x80\x9d of that range along with the sentencing goals enumerated in the Sentencing Reform Act (SRA).  <em>Id., </em>at 259, 264.  In place of the SRA provision governing appellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, the Court installed a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review.  <em>Id., </em>at 261.  Pp. 8\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In all material respects, California\xe2\x80\x99s DSL resembles the sentencing systems invalidated in <em>Blakely</em> and <em>Booker.</em>  Following the reasoning in those cases, the middle term prescribed under California law, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum.  Because aggravating facts that authorize the upper term are found by the judge, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, the DSL violates the rule of <em>Apprendi</em>.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While \xe2\x80\x9cthat should be the end of the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Blakely,</em> 542 U. S., at 313, in <em>People </em>v. <em>Black, </em>the California Supreme Court insisted that the DSL survives inspection under our precedents.  The <em>Black</em> court reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL did \xe2\x80\x9cnot represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a judge),\xe2\x80\x9d 35 Cal.\xc2\xa04th, at 1255\xe2\x80\x931256, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 543\xe2\x80\x93544.  This Court cautioned in <em>Blakely, </em>however,<em> </em>that broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in a particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from the force of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.  The <em>Black</em> court also urged that the DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing scheme; because the system is fair to defendants; and because the DSL requires statutory sentence enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators) to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  The <em>Black </em>court\xe2\x80\x99s examination, in short, satisfied it that California\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing system does not implicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions, however, leave no room for such an examination.  Asking whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s basic jury-trial right is preserved, though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge, is the very inquiry <em>Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>bright-line rule was designed to exclude.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the <em>Black</em> court relied on an equation of California\xe2\x80\x99s DSL to the post-<em>Booker</em> federal system.  That attempted comparison is unavailing.  The <em>Booker</em> Court held the Federal Guidelines incompatible with the Sixth Amendment because they were \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges,\xe2\x80\x9d 543 U. S., at 233.  To remedy the constitutional infirmity, the Court excised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as advisory only.  The DSL, however, does not resemble the advisory system the Court in <em>Booker</em> had in view.  Under California\xe2\x80\x99s system, judges are not free to exercise their \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  California\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them.  Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years, but had to impose 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless the judge found facts allowing a sentence of 6 or 16 years.  Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Black </em>court attempted to rescue the DSL\xe2\x80\x99s judicial factfinding authority by typing it a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint operative in the post-<em>Booker</em> federal system.  Reasonableness, however, is not the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis.  The reasonableness requirement <em>Booker</em> anticipated for the federal system operates <em>within</em> the constitutional constraints delineated in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.  Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment.  <em>Booker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for rendering this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment case law toothless.  Further elaboration here on the federal reasonableness standard is neither necessary nor proper.  The Court has granted review in two cases\xe2\x80\x94to be argued and decided later this Term\xe2\x80\x94raising questions trained on that matter.  <em>Claiborne</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x935618; <em>Rita</em> v. <em>United States</em>, No. 06\xe2\x80\x935754.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9321.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0As to the adjustment of California\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing system in light of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s ruling, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ball . . . lies in [California\xe2\x80\x99s] court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 265.  Several States have modified their systems in the wake of <em>Apprendi</em> and <em>Blakely</em> to retain determinate sentencing, by calling upon the jury to find any fact necessary to the imposition of an elevated sentence.  Other States have chosen to permit judges genuinely \xe2\x80\x9cto exercise broad discretion . . . within a statutory range,\xe2\x80\x9d which, \xe2\x80\x9ceveryone agrees,\xe2\x80\x9d encounters no Sixth Amendment shoal.  <em>Id</em>., at 233.  California may follow the paths taken by its sister States or otherwise alter its system, so long as it observes Sixth Amendment limitations declared in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions.

The facts so found are neither inherent in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict nor embraced by the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s plea, and they need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt.  The question presented is whether the DSL, by placing sentence-elevating factfinding within the judge\xe2\x80\x99s province, violates a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to trial by jury safeguarded by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments.  We hold that it does.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions instruct, the Federal Constitution\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee proscribes a sentencing scheme that allows a judge to impose a sentence above the statutory maximum based on a fact, other than a prior conviction, not found by a jury or admitted by the defendant.  <em>Apprendi</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html"></a><a href="/us/530/466/index.html">530 U.

Additional factfinding by the trial judge, however, yielded an upper term sentence of 16 years.  The California Court of Appeal affirmed the harsher sentence.

While the overall statutory maximum for a class B felony was ten years, the State\xe2\x80\x99s Sentencing Reform Act (Reform Act) added an important qualification: If no facts beyond those reflected in the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict were found by the trial judge, a defendant could not receive a sentence above a \xe2\x80\x9cstandard range\xe2\x80\x9d of 49 to 53 months.  <em>Id</em>., at 299\xe2\x80\x93300.  The Reform Act permitted but did not require a judge to exceed that standard range if she found \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98substantial and compelling reasons justifying an exceptional sentence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (quoting<em> </em>Wash. Rev. Code Ann. \xc2\xa79.94A.120(2) (2000)).  The Reform Act set out a nonexhaustive list of aggravating facts on which such a sentence elevation could be based.  It also clarified that a fact taken into account in fixing the standard range\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, any fact found by the jury\xe2\x80\x94could under no circumstances count in the determination whether to impose an exceptional sentence.  542 U. S., at 299\xe2\x80\x93300.  Blakely was sentenced to 90 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, more than three years above the standard range, based on the trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s finding that he had acted with deliberate cruelty.  <em>Id</em>., at 300.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying the rule of <em>Apprendi</em>, this Court held Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s sentence unconstitutional.  The State in <em>Blakely</em> had endeavored to distinguish <em>Apprendi</em> on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nder the Washington guidelines, an exceptional sentence is within the court\xe2\x80\x99s discretion as a result of a guilty verdict.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent in <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, O.T. 2003, No. 02\xe2\x80\x931632, p.\xc2\xa015.  We rejected that argument.  The judge could not have sentenced Blakely above the standard range without finding the additional fact of deliberate cruelty.  Consequently, that fact was subject to the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee.  542 U. S., at 304\xe2\x80\x93314.  It did not matter, we explained, that Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s sentence, though outside the standard range, was within the 10-year maximum for class B felonies:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cOur precedents make clear . . . that the \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi</em> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</em> . . . . In other words, the relevant \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 is not the maximum sentence a judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose <em>without</em> any additional findings.  When a judge inflicts punishment that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not allow, the jury has not found all the facts \xe2\x80\x98which the law makes essential to the punishment,\xe2\x80\x99 . . . and the judge exceeds his proper authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 303 (emphasis in original) (quoting 1 J. Bishop, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa787, p. 55 (2d ed. 1872)).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because the judge in Blakely\xe2\x80\x99s case could not have imposed a sentence outside the standard range without finding an additional fact, the top of that range\xe2\x80\x9453 months, and not 10 years\xe2\x80\x94was the relevant statutory maximum.  542 U. S., at 304.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The State had additionally argued in <em>Blakely</em> that <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule was satisfied because Washington\xe2\x80\x99s Reform Act did not specify an exclusive catalog of potential facts on which a judge might base a departure from the standard range.  This Court rejected that argument as well.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the judge\xe2\x80\x99s authority to impose an enhanced sentence depends on finding a specified fact\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6 one of several specified facts . . . or <em>any</em> aggravating fact (as here),\xe2\x80\x9d we observed, \xe2\x80\x9cit remains the case that the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  542 U. S., at 305 (emphasis in original).  Further, we held it irrelevant that the Reform Act ultimately left the decision whether or not to depart to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s discretion: \xe2\x80\x9cWhether the judicially determined facts <em>require</em> a sentence enhancement or merely <em>allow</em> it,\xe2\x80\x9d we noted, \xe2\x80\x9cthe verdict alone does not authorize the sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>., n.\xc2\xa08 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Freddie Booker was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine and was sentenced under the Federal Sentencing Guidelines.  The facts found by Booker\xe2\x80\x99s jury yielded a base Guidelines range of 210 to 262 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment, a range the judge could not exceed without undertaking additional factfinding.  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 227, 233\xe2\x80\x93234.  The judge did so, finding by a preponderance of the evidence that Booker possessed an amount of drugs in excess of the amount determined by the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  That finding boosted Booker into a higher Guidelines range.  Booker was sentenced at the bottom of the higher range, to 360 months in prison.  <em>Id</em>., at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an opinion written by Justice Stevens for a five-Member majority, the Court held Booker\xe2\x80\x99s sentence impermissible under the Sixth Amendment.  In the majority\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, there was \xe2\x80\x9cno distinction of constitutional significance between the Federal Sentencing Guidelines and the Washington procedures at issue in <em>[Blakely]</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 233.  Both systems were \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and impose[d] binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 opinion for the Court, it bears emphasis, next expressed a view on which there was no disagreement among the Justices.  He acknowledged that the Federal Guidelines would not implicate the Sixth Amendment were they advisory:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.  We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range.  Indeed, everyone agrees that the constitutional issues presented by [this case] would have been avoided entirely if Congress had omitted from the [federal Sentencing Reform Act] the provisions that make the Guidelines binding on district judges . . . . For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe Guidelines as written, however, are not advisory; they are mandatory and binding on all judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an opinion written by Justice Breyer, also garnering a five-Member majority, the Court faced the remedial question, which turned on an assessment of legislative intent: What alteration would Congress have intended had it known that the Guidelines were vulnerable to a Sixth Amendment challenge?  Three choices were apparent: the Court could invalidate in its entirety the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (SRA), the law comprehensively delineating the federal sentencing system; or it could preserve the SRA, and the mandatory Guidelines regime the SRA established, by attaching a jury-trial requirement to any fact increasing a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s base Guidelines range; finally, the Court could render the Guidelines advisory by severing two provisions of the SRA, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) and 3742(e) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV).  543 U. S., at 246\xe2\x80\x93249.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9creasonable minds can, and do, differ\xe2\x80\x9d on the remedial question, the majority concluded that the advisory Guidelines solution came closest to the congressional mark.  <em>Id</em>., at 248\xe2\x80\x93258.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the system described in Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court in <em>Booker</em>, judges would no longer be tied to the sentencing range indicated in the Guidelines.  But they would be obliged to \xe2\x80\x9ctake account of\xe2\x80\x9d that range along with the sentencing goals Congress enumerated in the SRA at 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a).  543 U. S., at 259, 264.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Having severed \xc2\xa73742(e), the provision of the SRA governing appellate review of sentences under the mandatory Guidelines scheme, see <em>supra</em>, at 13, and n.\xc2\xa011, the Court installed, as consistent with the Act and the sound administration of justice, a \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d standard of review.  543 U. S., at 261.  Without attempting an elaborate discussion of that standard, Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s remedial opinion for the Court observed: \xe2\x80\x9cSection 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing.  Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  The Court emphasized the provisional character of the <em>Booker</em> remedy.  Recognizing that authority to speak \xe2\x80\x9cthe last word\xe2\x80\x9d resides in Congress, the Court said: </p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe ball now lies in Congress\xe2\x80\x99 court.  The National Legislature is equipped to devise and install, long term, the sentencing system, compatible with the Constitution, that Congress judges best for the federal system of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 265.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We turn now to the instant case in light of both parts of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Booker</em> opinion, and our earlier decisions in point.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under California\xe2\x80\x99s DSL, an upper term sentence may be imposed only when the trial judge finds an aggravating circumstance.  See <em>supra</em>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935.  An element of the charged offense, essential to a jury\xe2\x80\x99s determination of guilt, or admitted in a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s guilty plea, does not qualify as such a circumstance.  See <em>supra</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Instead, aggravating circumstances depend on facts found discretely and solely by the judge.  In accord with <em>Blakely</em>, therefore, the middle term prescribed in California\xe2\x80\x99s statutes, not the upper term, is the relevant statutory maximum.  542 U.

Because circumstances in aggravation are found by the judge, not the jury, and need only be established by a preponderance of the evidence, not beyond a reasonable doubt, see <em>supra</em>, at 5, the DSL violates <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s bright-line rule: Except for a prior conviction, \xe2\x80\x9cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  530 U.

The <em>Black</em> court acknowledged that California\xe2\x80\x99s system appears on surface inspection to be in tension with the rule of <em>Apprendi</em>.  But in \xe2\x80\x9coperation and effect,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, the DSL \xe2\x80\x9csimply authorize[s] a sentencing court to engage in the type of factfinding that traditionally has been incident to the judge\xe2\x80\x99s selection of an appropriate sentence within a statutorily prescribed sentencing range.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 Cal. 4th, at 1254, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 543.  Therefore, the court concluded, \xe2\x80\x9cthe upper term is the \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 and a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s imposition of an upper term sentence does not violate a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to a jury trial under the principles set forth in <em>Apprendi</em>, <em>Blakely</em>, and <em>Booker</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.

First, the court reasoned that, given the ample discretion afforded trial judges to identify aggravating facts warranting an upper term sentence, the DSL</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cdoes not represent a legislative effort to shift the proof of particular facts from elements of a crime (to be proved to a jury) to sentencing factors (to be decided by a judge). . . . Instead, it afforded the sentencing judge the discretion to decide, with the guidance of rules and statutes, whether the facts of the case and the history of the defendant justify the higher sentence.  Such a system does not diminish the traditional power of the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1256, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 544 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We cautioned in <em>Blakely</em>, however, that broad discretion to decide what facts may support an enhanced sentence, or to determine whether an enhanced sentence is warranted in any particular case, does not shield a sentencing system from the force of our decisions.  If the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict alone does not authorize the sentence, if, instead, the judge must find an additional fact to impose the longer term, the Sixth Amendment requirement is not satisfied.  <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at 305, and n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Black</em> court also urged that the DSL is not cause for concern because it reduced the penalties for most crimes over the prior indeterminate sentencing regime.  35 Cal. 4th, at 1256\xe2\x80\x931258, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 544\xe2\x80\x93545.

Furthermore, California\xe2\x80\x99s system is not unfair to defendants, for they \xe2\x80\x9ccannot reasonably expect a guarantee that the upper term will not be imposed\xe2\x80\x9d given judges\xe2\x80\x99 broad discretion to impose an upper term sentence or to keep their punishment at the middle term.  35 Cal. 4th, at 1258\xe2\x80\x931259, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 545\xe2\x80\x93546.  The <em>Black </em>court additionally noted that the DSL requires statutory enhancements (as distinguished from aggravators)\xe2\x80\x94<em>e.g.</em>, the use of a firearm or other dangerous weapon, infliction of great bodily injury, Penal Code \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa712022, 12022.7\xe2\x80\x93.8 (West 2000 and Supp. 2006)\xe2\x80\x94to be charged in the indictment and proved to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.  35 Cal. 4th, at 1257, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 545.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Black</em> court\xe2\x80\x99s examination of the DSL, in short, satisfied it that California\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing system does not implicate significantly the concerns underlying the Sixth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s jury-trial guarantee.  Our decisions, however, leave no room for such an examination.  Asking whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s basic jury-trial right is preserved, though some facts essential to punishment are reserved for determination by the judge, we have said, is the <em>very</em> inquiry <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line rule\xe2\x80\x9d was designed to exclude.  See <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at 307\xe2\x80\x93308.  But see <em>Black</em>, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1260, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 547 (stating, remarkably, that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he high court precedents do not draw a bright line\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ultimately, the <em>Black</em> court relied on an equation of California\xe2\x80\x99s DSL system to the post-<em>Booker</em> federal system.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe level of discretion available to a California judge in selecting which of the three available terms to impose,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, \xe2\x80\x9cappears comparable to the level of discretion that the high court has chosen to permit federal judges in post-<em>Booker</em> sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  35 Cal. 4th, at 1261, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 548.  The same equation drives Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s dissent.  See <em>post</em>, at 1 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe California sentencing law . .\xc2\xa0. is indistinguishable in any constitutionally significant respect from the advisory Guidelines scheme that the Court approved in <em>[Booker]</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attempted comparison is unavailing.  As earlier explained, see <em>supra</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, this Court in <em>Booker</em> held the Federal Sentencing Guidelines incompatible with the Sixth Amendment because the Guidelines were \xe2\x80\x9cmandatory and imposed binding requirements on all sentencing judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  543 U. S., at 233.  \xe2\x80\x9c[M]erely advisory provisions,\xe2\x80\x9d recommending but not requiring \xe2\x80\x9cthe selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts,\xe2\x80\x9d all Members of the Court agreed, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not implicate the Sixth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  To remedy the constitutional infirmity found in <em>Booker</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s majority excised provisions that rendered the system mandatory, leaving the Guidelines in place as advisory only.  <em>Id</em>., at 245\xe2\x80\x93246.  See also <em>supra</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California\xe2\x80\x99s DSL does not resemble the advisory system the <em>Booker</em> Court had in view.  Under California\xe2\x80\x99s system, judges are not free to exercise their \xe2\x80\x9cdiscretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U. S., at 233.  California\xe2\x80\x99s Legislature has adopted sentencing triads, three fixed sentences with no ranges between them.  Cunningham\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing judge had no discretion to select a sentence within a range of 6 to 16 years.  His instruction was to select 12 years, nothing less and nothing more, unless he found facts allowing the imposition of a sentence of 6 or 16 years.  Factfinding to elevate a sentence from 12 to 16 years, our decisions make plain, falls within the province of the jury employing a beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard, not the bailiwick of a judge determining where the preponderance of the evidence lies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the <em>Black</em> court attempted to rescue the DSL\xe2\x80\x99s judicial factfinding authority by typing it simply a reasonableness constraint, equivalent to the constraint operative in the federal system post-<em>Booker</em>.  See 35 Cal. 4th, at 1261, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 548 (\xe2\x80\x9cBecause an aggravating factor under California law may include any factor that the judge reasonably deems relevant, the [DSL\xe2\x80\x99s] requirement that an upper term sentence be imposed only if an aggravating factor exists is comparable to <em>Booker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that a federal judge\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing decision not be unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d).  Reasonableness, however, is not, as the <em>Black</em> court would have it, the touchstone of Sixth Amendment analysis.  The reasonableness requirement <em>Booker</em> anticipated for the federal system operates <em>within</em> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.  Because the DSL allocates to judges sole authority to find facts permitting the imposition of an upper term sentence, the system violates the Sixth Amendment.  It is comforting, but beside the point, that California\xe2\x80\x99s system requires judge-determined DSL sentences to be reasonable.  <em>Booker</em>\xe2\x80\x99s remedy for the Federal Guidelines, in short, is not a recipe for rendering our Sixth Amendment case law toothless.[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To summarize: Contrary to the <em>Black</em> court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, our decisions from <em>Apprendi</em> to <em>Booker</em> point to the middle term specified in California\xe2\x80\x99s statutes, not the upper term, as the relevant statutory maximum.  Because the DSL authorizes the judge, not the jury, to find the facts permitting an upper term sentence, the system cannot withstand measurement against our Sixth Amendment precedent.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As to the adjustment of California\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing system in light of our decision, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he ball . . . lies in [California\xe2\x80\x99s] court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>, 543 U.

S. 466</a> (2000).  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States</em> v. <em>Booker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/543/220/index.html">543 U.

S. 227</a>, 264\xe2\x80\x93272 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  The discussion in his dissenting opinion is fully sufficient to show why, in my respectful view, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis and holding are mistaken.  It does seem appropriate to add this brief, further comment.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In my view the <em>Apprendi</em> line of cases remains incorrect.  Yet there may be a principled rationale permitting those cases to control within the central sphere of their concern, while reducing the collateral, widespread harm to the criminal justice system and the corrections process now resulting from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s wooden, unyielding insistence on expanding the <em>Apprendi</em> doctrine far beyond its necessary boundaries.  The Court could distinguish between sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offense, where the <em>Apprendi</em> principle would apply, and sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offender, where it would not.  California attempted to make this initial distinction.  Compare Cal. Rule of Court 4.421(a) (Criminal Cases) (West 2006) (listing aggravating \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acts relating to the crime\xe2\x80\x9d), with Rule 4.421(b) (listing aggravating \xe2\x80\x9c[f]acts relating to the defendant\xe2\x80\x9d).  The Court should not foreclose its efforts.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California, as the Court notes, experimented earlier with an indeterminate sentencing system.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3.  The State reposed vast power and discretion in a nonjudicial agency to set a release date for convicted felons.  That system, it seems, would have been untouched by <em>Apprendi</em>.  When the State sought to reform its system, it might have chosen to give its judges the authority to sentence to a maximum but to depart downward for unexplained reasons.  That too, by considerable irony, would be untouched by <em>Apprendi</em>.  Instead, California sought to use a system based on guided discretion.  <em>Apprendi</em>, the Court holds today, forecloses this option.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As dissenting opinions have suggested before, the Constitution ought not to be interpreted to strike down all aspects of sentencing systems that grant judicial discretion with some legislative direction and control.  Judges and legislators must have the capacity to develop consistent standards, standards that individual juries empaneled for only a short time cannot elaborate in any permanent way.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Blakely</em>, 542 U. S., at 314 (opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J.); <em>id.,</em> at 326\xe2\x80\x93327 (opinion of Kennedy, J.) (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9c[s]entencing guidelines are a prime example of [the] collaborative process\xe2\x80\x9d between courts and legislatures).  Judges and sentencing officials have a broad view and long-term commitment to correctional systems.  Juries do not.  Judicial officers and corrections professionals, under the guidance and control of the legislature, should be encouraged to participate in an ongoing manner to improve the various sentencing schemes in our country.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This system of guided discretion would be permitted to a large extent if the Court confined the <em>Apprendi</em> rule to sentencing enhancements based on the nature of the offense.  These would include, for example, the fact that a weapon was used; violence was employed; a stated amount of drugs or other contraband was involved; or the crime was motivated by the victim\xe2\x80\x99s race, gender, or other status protected by statute.  Juries could consider these matters without serious disruption because these factors often are part of the statutory definition of an aggravated crime in any event and because the evidence to support these enhancements is likely to be a central part of the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s case.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the other hand, judicial determination is appropriate with regard to factors exhibited by the defendant.  These would include, for example, prior convictions; cooperation or noncooperation with law enforcement; remorse or the lack of it; or other aspects of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s history bearing upon his background and contribution to the community.  This is so even if the relevant facts were to be found by the judge by a preponderance of the evidence.  These are facts that should be taken into account at sentencing but have little if any significance for whether the defendant committed the crime.  See Berman &amp; Bibas, Making Sentencing Sensible, 4 Ohio St. J. Crim. L. 37, 55\xe2\x80\x9357 (2006).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The line between offense and offender would not always be clear, but in most instances the nature of the offense is defined in a manner that ensures the problem of categories would not be difficult.  <em>Apprendi</em> suffers from a similar line-drawing problem between facts that must be considered by the jury and other considerations that a judge can take into account.  The main part of the <em>Apprendi</em> holding could be retained with far less systemic disruption.  It is to be regretted that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision today appears to foreclose consideration of this approach or other reasonable efforts to develop systems of guided discretion within the general constraint that <em>Apprendi </em>imposes.</f></p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962218">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nALITO, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nCUNNINGHAM V.

S. 220</a> (2005).  Both sentencing schemes grant trial judges considerable discretion in sentencing; both subject the exercise of that discretion to appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d; and both\xe2\x80\x94the California law explicitly, and the federal scheme implicitly\xe2\x80\x94require a sentencing judge to find some factor to justify a sentence above the minimum that could be imposed based solely on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict.  Because this Court has held unequivocally that the post-<em>Booker </em>federal sentencing system satisfies the requirements of the Sixth Amendment, the same should be true with regard to the California system.  I therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Apprendi </em>v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/530/466/index.html">530 U. S. 466</a> (2000), and the cases that have followed in its wake, the Court has held that under certain circumstances a criminal defendant possesses the Sixth Amendment right to have a jury find facts that result in an increased sentence.  The Court, however, has never suggested that all factual findings that affect a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s sentence must be made by a jury.  On the contrary, in <em>Apprendi </em>and later cases, the Court has consistently stated that when a trial court makes a fully discretionary sentencing decision (such as a sentencing decision under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 federal sentencing system), the Sixth Amendment permits the court to base the sentence on its own factual findings.  See <em>id.,</em> at 481; <em>Blakely</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/542/296/index.html">542 U. S. 296</a>, 305 (2004); <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 233; see also <em>Harris </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/545/index.html">536 U. S. 545</a>, 558 (2002).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Applying this rule, the <em>Booker </em>Court unanimously agreed that judicial factfinding under a purely advisory guidelines system would likewise comport with the Sixth Amendment.  Writing for the five Justices who struck down the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines system, Justice Stevens stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf the Guidelines as currently written could be read as merely advisory provisions that recommended, rather than required, the selection of particular sentences in response to differing sets of facts, their use would not implicate the Sixth Amendment.  We have never doubted the authority of a judge to exercise broad discretion in imposing a sentence within a statutory range\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  For when a trial judge exercises his discretion to select a specific sentence within a defined range, the defendant has no right to a jury determination of the facts that the judge deems relevant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Booker</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 233<em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a similar vein, the remedial portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in Booker</em>, written by Justice Breyer, held that the Sixth Amendment permits a system of advisory guidelines with reasonableness review.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion avoided a blanket invalidation of the Guidelines by excising the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act, 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) (2000 ed., Supp. IV), that required a sentencing judge to impose a sentence within the applicable Guidelines range.  See <em>Booker</em>,<em> </em>543 U. S., at 259.  As Justice Breyer explained, \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of \xc2\xa73553(b)(1) is a necessary condition of the constitutional violation.  That is to say, without this provision \xe2\x80\xa6 the statute falls outside the scope of <em>Apprendi</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the post-<em>Booker</em> federal sentencing system, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he district courts, while not bound to apply the Guidelines, must consult those Guidelines and take them into account when sentencing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 264.  In addition, sentencing courts must take account of the general sentencing goals set forth by Congress, including avoiding unwarranted sentencing disparities, providing restitution to victims, reflecting the seriousness of the offense, promoting respect for the law, providing just punishment, affording adequate deterrence, protecting the public, and effectively providing the defendant with needed educational or vocational training and medical care.  See <em>id., </em>at 260 (citing 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73553(a) (2000 ed. and Supp. IV)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is significant that <em>Booker</em>, while rendering the Guidelines advisory, did not reinstitute the pre-Guidelines federal sentencing system, under which \xe2\x80\x9cwell-established doctrine bar[red] review of the exercise of sentencing discretion\xe2\x80\x9d within the broad sentencing ranges imposed by the criminal statutes.  <em>Dorszynski </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/418/424/index.html">418 U. S. 424</a>, 443 (1974).  Rather, <em>Booker</em> conditioned a district court\xe2\x80\x99s sentencing discretion on appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the Guidelines and the \xc2\xa73553(a) factors.  See <em>Booker,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 261 (\xe2\x80\x9cSection 3553(a) remains in effect, and sets forth numerous factors that guide sentencing.  Those factors in turn will guide appellate courts, as they have in the past, in determining whether a sentence is unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although the <em>Booker </em>Court did not spell out in detail how sentencing judges are to proceed under the new advisory Guidelines regime, it seems clear that this regime permits\xe2\x80\x94and, indeed, requires\xe2\x80\x94sentencing judges to make factual findings and to base their sentences on those findings.  The federal criminal statutes generally set out wide sentencing ranges, and thus in each case a sentencing judge must use some criteria in selecting the sentence to be imposed.  In doing this, federal judges have generally made and relied upon factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offender\xe2\x80\x94and it is impossible to imagine how federal judges could reasonably carry out their sentencing responsibilities without making such factual determinations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the mandatory Federal Sentencing Guidelines regime, these factual determinations were relatively formal and precise.  (For example, a trial judge under that regime might have found based on a post-trial proceeding that a drug offense involved six kilograms of cocaine or that the loss caused by a mail fraud offense was $2.5 million.)  By contrast, under the pre-Sentencing Reform Act federal system, the factual determinations were often relatively informal and imprecise.  (A trial judge might have concluded from the presentence report that an offense involved \xe2\x80\x9ca large quantity of drugs\xe2\x80\x9d or that a mail fraud scheme caused \xe2\x80\x9ca great loss.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Under both systems, however, the judges made factual determinations about the nature of the offense and the offender and determined the sentence accordingly.  And as the Courts of Appeals have unanimously concluded, the post-<em>Booker</em> federal sentencing regime also permits trial judges to make such factual findings and to rely on those findings in selecting the sentences that are appropriate in particular cases.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under the post-<em>Booker</em> system, if a defendant believes that his or her sentence was based on an erroneous factual determination, it seems clear that the defendant may challenge that finding on appeal.  As noted, the post-<em>Booker </em>system permits a defendant to obtain appellate review of the reasonableness of a sentence, and a sentence that the sentencing court justifies solely on the basis of an erroneous finding of fact can hardly be regarded as reasonable.  Thus, under the post-<em>Booker</em> system, there will be cases\xe2\x80\x94and, in all likelihood, a good many cases\xe2\x80\x94in which the question whether a defendant will be required to serve a greater or lesser sentence depends on whether a court of appeals sustains a finding of fact made by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A simple example illustrates this point.  Suppose that a defendant is found guilty of 10 counts of mail fraud in that the defendant made 10 mailings in furtherance of a scheme to defraud.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV).  Under the mail fraud statute, the district court would have discretion to sentence the defendant to any sentence ranging from probation up to 50 years of imprisonment (5 years on each count).  Suppose that the sentencing judge imposes the maximum sentence allowed by statute\xe2\x80\x9450 years of imprisonment\xe2\x80\x94without identifying a single fact about the offense or the offender as a justification for this lengthy sentence.  Surely that would be an unreasonable sentence that could not be sustained on appeal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Suppose, alternatively, that the sentencing court finds that the mail fraud scheme caused a loss of $1 million and that the victims were elderly people of limited means, and suppose that the court, based on these findings, imposes a sentence of 10 years of imprisonment.  If the defendant challenges the sentence on appeal on the ground that these findings are erroneous, the question whether the defendant will be required to serve 10 years or some lesser sentence may well depend on the validity of the district court\xe2\x80\x99s findings of fact.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Booker</em>, then, approved a sentencing system that (1) requires a sentencing judge to \xe2\x80\x9cconsult\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ctake into account\xe2\x80\x9d legislatively defined sentencing factors and guidelines; (2) subjects a sentencing judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of sentencing discretion to appellate review for \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d; and (3) requires sentencing judges to make factual findings in order to support the exercise of this discretion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The California sentencing law that the Court strikes down today is not meaningfully different from the federal scheme upheld in <em>Booker</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the California law gives a judge at least as much sentencing discretion as does the post-<em>Booker</em> federal scheme.  California\xe2\x80\x99s system of sentencing triads and separate \xe2\x80\x9cenhancements\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>] was enacted to achieve sentences \xe2\x80\x9cin proportion to the seriousness of the offense as determined by the Legislature to be imposed by the court with specified discretion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71170(a)(1) (West Supp. 2006).  This \xe2\x80\x9cspecified discretion\xe2\x80\x9d is quite broad.  Under the statute, a sentencing court \xe2\x80\x9cshall order imposition of the middle term\xe2\x80\x9d of the base-term triad, \xe2\x80\x9cunless there are circumstances in aggravation or mitigation of the crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71170(b).  While the court may not rely on any fact that is an essential element of the crime or of a proven enhancement, the \xe2\x80\x9csentencing judge retains considerable discretion to identify aggravating factors.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People </em>v. <em>Black</em>,<em> </em>35 Cal. 4th 1238, 1247, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d 534, 538 (2005).</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>In exercising its sentencing discretion, a California court can look to any of the 16 specific aggravating circumstances, see Cal. Rule of Court (Criminal Cases) 4.421 (West 2006), or 15 specific mitigating circumstances, see Rule 4.423, itemized in the California Rules of Court.  A California trial court can also consider the \xe2\x80\x9c[g]eneral objectives of sentencing,\xe2\x80\x9d including protecting society, punishing the defendant, encouraging the defendant to lead a law-abiding life and deterring the defendant from committing future offenses, deterring others from criminal conduct by demonstrating its consequences, preventing the defendant from committing new crimes by means of incarceration, securing restitution for crime victims, and achieving uniformity in sentencing.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Rule 4.410(a).  And if a California trial court finds that its sentencing authority is unduly restricted by these factors, which the California Supreme Court has recognized \xe2\x80\x9care largely the articulation of considerations sentencing judges have always used in making these decisions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>People </em>v. <em>Hernandez</em>, 46 Cal. 3d 194, 205, 757 P.\xc2\xa02d 1013, 1019, (1988) (in bank), overruled on other grounds,<em> People</em> v. <em>King</em>, 5 Cal. 4th 59, 78, n.\xc2\xa05, 851 P.\xc2\xa02d 27, 39, n.\xc2\xa05 (1993) (in banc), a California sentencing judge is also authorized to consider any \xe2\x80\x9cadditional criteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 4.408(a); see also <em>Black</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 1256, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 544 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Legislature did not identify all of the particular facts that could justify the upper term\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, under California law, the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98circumstances\xe2\x80\x99 the sentencing judge may look to in aggravation or in mitigation of the crime include \xe2\x80\xa6 \xe2\x80\x98practically everything which has a legitimate bearing\xe2\x80\x99 on the matter in issue.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>People </em>v. <em>Guevara</em>, 88 Cal.

Indeed, as one California court has explained, sentencing discretion may even be guided by a \xe2\x80\x9cjudge\xe2\x80\x99s subjective determination of \xe2\x80\xa6 the appropriate aggregate sentence\xe2\x80\x9d based on his \xe2\x80\x9cexperiences with prior cases and the record in the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People </em>v. <em>Stevens</em>, 205 Cal.

Indeed, the California Supreme Court, authoritatively construing the California statute,[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] has explained that \xc2\xa71170(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that an aggravating factor exist is merely a requirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <em>reasonable</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Black</em>, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1255, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 544 (emphasis in original); see also <em>id., </em>at 1257\xe2\x80\x931258, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 545<em> </em>(\xe2\x80\x9cThe jury\xe2\x80\x99s verdict of guilty on an offense authorizes the judge to sentence a defendant to any of the three terms specified by statute as the potential punishments for that offense, as long as the judge exercises his or her discretion in a reasonable manner that is consistent with the requirements and guidelines contained in statutes and court rules\xe2\x80\x9d).  Even when a court imposes the \xe2\x80\x9cpresumptive\xe2\x80\x9d middle term, its decision is reviewable for abuse of discretion\xe2\x80\x94that is, its decision to sentence at the \xe2\x80\x9cstandard\xe2\x80\x9d term must be reasonable.  See <em>People</em> v. <em>Cattaneo</em>, 217 Cal. App. 3d 1577, 1587\xe2\x80\x931588, 266 Cal. Rptr. 710, 716 (1990).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the California system, like the post-<em>Booker </em>federal regime, recognizes that a sentencing judge must have the ability to look at <em>all</em> the relevant facts\xe2\x80\x94even those outside the trial record and jury verdict\xe2\x80\x94in exercising his or her discretion.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe judicial factfinding that occurs during that selection process is the same type of judicial factfinding that traditionally has been a part of the sentencing process.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Black</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 1258, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 545.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite these similarities between the California system and the \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory Guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d scheme approved in <em>Booker</em>, the Court nevertheless holds that the California regime runs afoul of the Sixth Amendment.  The Court reasons as follows: (1) California requires that some aggravating fact, apart from the elements of the offense found by the jury, must support an upper term sentence; (2) <em>Blakely</em> defined the \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory maximum\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum sentence a judge may impose<em> solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original); and therefore (3) the California regime violates \xe2\x80\x9c<em>Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>bright-line rule,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 308, that \xe2\x80\x9cany fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Apprendi</em>, 530 U. S., at 490.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is flawed.  For one thing, it is not at all clear that a California court must find some case-specific, adjudicative \xe2\x80\x9cfact\xe2\x80\x9d (as opposed to identifying a relevant policy consideration) before imposing an upper term sentence.  What a California sentencing court must find is a \xe2\x80\x9c<em>circumstanc[e]</em> <em>in aggravation</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d Cal. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa71170(b) (emphasis added), which, California\xe2\x80\x99s Court Rules make clear, can include any \xe2\x80\x9ccriteria reasonably related to the decision being made.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 4.408(a).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0California courts are thus empowered to take into account the full panoply of factual and policy considerations that have traditionally been considered by judges operating under fully discretionary sentencing regimes\xe2\x80\x94the constitutionality of which the Court has repeatedly reaffirmed.  California law explicitly authorizes a sentencing court to take into account, for example, broad sentencing objectives like punishment, deterrence, restitution, and uniformity, see Rule 4.410, and even a judge\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9csubjective belief\xe2\x80\x9d as to the appropriateness of the sentence, see <em>Stevens</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 1457, 253 Cal. Rptr., at 177, as long as the final result is reasonable.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Policy considerations like these have always been outside the province of the jury and do not implicate the Sixth Amendment concerns expressed in <em>Apprendi</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In short, the requirement that a California court find some \xe2\x80\x9ccircumstanc[e] in aggravation\xe2\x80\x9d before imposing an upper term sentence is not the same as a requirement that it find an aggravating <em>fact</em>.  And if a California sentencing court need not find a fact beyond those \xe2\x80\x9creflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Blakely, supra,</em> at 303 (emphasis deleted), then <em>Apprendi\xe2\x80\x99</em>s \xe2\x80\x9cbright-line rule\xe2\x80\x9d plainly does not apply.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if the California law did require that a sentencing court find some aggravating \xe2\x80\x9cfact\xe2\x80\x9d before imposing an upper term sentence, that would not make this case constitutionally distinguishable from <em>Booker</em>.  As previously explained, the \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory Guidelines,\xe2\x80\x9d bounded by reasonableness review, effectively (albeit less explicitly) impose the same requirement on federal judges.  <em>Booker\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>reasonableness review necessarily supposes that some sentences will be unreasonable in the absence of additional facts justifying them.  (Recall the prior hypothetical case in which it was posited that the district court imposed a sentence of 50 years of imprisonment for mail fraud without citing a single aggravating fact about the offense or the offender.)  Thus, although the post-<em>Booker </em>Guidelines are labeled \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory,\xe2\x80\x9d reasonableness review imposes a very real constraint on a judge\xe2\x80\x99s ability to sentence across the full statutory range without finding some aggravating fact.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court downplays the significance of <em>Booker</em> reasonableness review on the ground that <em>Booker</em>-style \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness \xe2\x80\xa6 operates <em>within</em> the Sixth Amendment constraints delineated in our precedent, not as a substitute for those constraints.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 20 (emphasis in original).  But this begs the question, which concerns the scope of those \xe2\x80\x9cSixth Amendment constraints.\xe2\x80\x9d  That question is answered by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s remedial holding in <em>Booker</em>, which necessarily stands for the proposition that it is consistent with the Sixth Amendment for the imposition of an enhanced sentence to be conditioned on a factual finding made by a sentencing judge and not by a jury.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court relies heavily on <em>Blakely\xe2\x80\x99</em>s admonition that \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98statutory maximum\xe2\x80\x99 for <em>Apprendi</em> purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose <em>solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d 542 U. S., at 303 (emphasis in original).  But the Court fails to recognize how this statement must be understood in the wake of <em>Booker</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For each statutory offense, there must be a sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that can be regarded as reasonable in light of the bare statutory elements found by the jury.  To return to our prior example of a mail fraud offense, there must be some sentence that represents the least onerous sentence that would be appropriate in a case in which the statutory elements of mail fraud are satisfied but in which the offense and the offender are as little deserving of punishment as can be imagined.  (Whether this sentence is the statutory minimum (probation, see 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71341 (2000 ed., Supp. IV)) or the minimum under the advisory Guidelines (also probation, see United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual \xc2\xa72B1.1 and Sentencing Table (Nov. 2006)) is irrelevant for present purposes; what is relevant is that there must be <em>some</em> minimum reasonable sentence.)  This sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cthe maximum sentence\xe2\x80\x9d that could reasonably be imposed \xe2\x80\x9csolely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Blakely</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 303 (emphasis deleted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Booker\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>reasonableness review necessarily anticipates that the imposition of sentences above this level may be conditioned upon findings of fact made by a judge and not by the jury.  <em>Booker</em> held that a system of \xe2\x80\x9cadvisory Guidelines\xe2\x80\x9d with reasonableness review is consistent with the Sixth Amendment, and the same analysis should govern California\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crequirement that the decision to impose the upper term be <em>reasonable</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Black</em>, 35 Cal. 4th, at 1255, 113 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 544 (emphasis in original).  That the California requirement is explicit, while the federal aggravating factor requirement is (at least for now) implicit, should not be constitutionally dispositive.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unless the Court is prepared to overrule the remedial decision in <em>Booker</em>, the California sentencing scheme at issue in this case should be held to be consistent with the Sixth Amendment.  I would therefore affirm the decision of the California Court of Appeal.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s recognition of this is hardly surprising since, as Judge McConnell has pointed out, \xe2\x80\x9cfully discretionary sentencing \xe2\x80\xa6 was the system [that was] in place when the Sixth Amendment was adopted\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9cprevailed in the federal courts from the Founding until enactment of the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 \xe2\x80\xa6 without anyone ever suggesting a conflict with the Sixth Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  McConnell, The <em>Booker </em>Mess, 83 Denver U.
