That act declares that all navigable waters within the said state shall forever remain public highways, free to the citizens of said state and the United States.  What is the footing on which the original states stand in regard to the shores of their navigable rivers, and the soil covered by them?  That footing is certainly the perfect and absolute control of the shores of those rivers in the respective states, except so far as the United States government may find it necessary to use them in the legitimate exercise of its constitutional rights.  For the purpose of enabling itself to do this, so far as Alabama is concerned, it has not thought proper to assert any rights of ownership in the shore, but has rather relinquished the idea of such ownership in itself, and recognized it in the state, by stipulating for a free use of said shores by the citizens of the United States."</p>\n<p>"What has been said is based upon the assumption that, by the treaty with Spain, the United States acquired the same property in the shores of navigable rivers that Spain had, and that they had, by the act of 1819, transferred the rights acquired under the treaty to the State of Alabama, reserving only the easement of navigation to the citizens of the United States.  The question then arises could the United States, in contravention of the obligation they had incurred under the Spanish treaty, ratify and confirm these Spanish grants?"</p>\n<p>"If Spain could have granted the shores of navigable rivers, and the same power that Spain had had been conferred upon the United States by the treaty of 1819, and in pursuance of that treaty and the pledges therein given, the United States had confirmed this grant prior to the admission of Alabama into the Union, there can be no doubt that the plaintiff\'s title would have been valid; but this was not done."</p>\n<p>"Before it is done, the United States place themselves in a position where they cannot do it.

S. 477</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This is an action of ejectment brought by the plaintiff in error to recover a lot of ground in the Town of Mobile, in the State of Alabama.  The plaintiff claimed title under an inchoate Spanish grant dated December 12, 1809, and an Act of Congress confirming this title passed July 2, 1836, and a patent from the United States dated March 15, 1837, which issued in pursuance of the act of Congress.</p>\n<p>The validity of this title was disputed by the defendant upon the ground that the premises were a part of the shore of a navigable tidewater river, lying below high water mark, when the State of Alabama was admitted into the Union in 1819, and that therefore, at the time of the passage of the act of Congress, the sovereignty and dominion over the place in question </p><p><a class="page-number" name="478">Page 50 U. S. 478</a></p><p> were in the state, and not in the United States.  And the court instructed the jury that if the land described in the plaintiff\'s declaration was below ordinary high water mark at the time Alabama was admitted into the Union, the confirming act of Congress and the patent conveyed no title to the patentee.</p>\n<p>The question decided in the state court cannot be regarded as an open one.  The same question upon the same act of Congress and patent was brought before this Court in the case of <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/44/212/case.html">Pollard v. Hagan,</a></span></em> at January term, 1845, reported in 3 How. 212.  That case was fully and deliberately considered, as will appear by the report, and the Court then decided that the act of Congress and patent conveyed no title.  The decision of the Supreme Court of Alabama, from which this case has been brought by writ of error, conforms to the opinion of this Court in the case of <em>Pollard v. Hagan.</em>  And it must be a very strong case indeed, and one where mistake and error had been evidently committed, to justify this Court, after the lapse of five years, in reversing its own decision, thereby destroying rights of property which may have been purchased and paid for in the meantime upon the faith and confidence reposed in the judgment of this Court.  But upon a review of the case we see no reason for doubting its correctness, and are entirely satisfied with the judgment then pronounced.</p>\n<p>It has been supposed in the argument for the plaintiff that the proceedings in Congress upon the report of the commissioners in relation to the title claimed under the Spanish authorities which have now been referred to distinguish this case from that of <em>Pollard v. Hagan.</em>  But this Spanish title was acquired in 1809, and it has been repeatedly decided that a Spanish grant in this territory, whether inchoate or complete, made after the Treaty of St. Ildefonso in 1800 did not convey any right in the soil to the grantee.  And this subject was again considered and decided, after careful research and examination, at the present term, in the case of <em>Reynes v. United States,</em> and the former decisions reaffirmed.  Undoubtedly, Congress might have granted this land to the patentee, or confirmed his Spanish grant, before Alabama became a state.  But this was not done.  And the existence of this imperfect and inoperative Spanish grant could not enlarge the power of the United States over the place in question after Alabama became a state, nor authorize the general government to grant or confirm a title to land when the sovereignty and dominion over it had become vested in the state.</p>\n<p><em>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Alabama is therefore affirmed.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Supreme Court of the State of Alabama and was argued by counsel.  n consideration whereof it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that the judgment of the said supreme court in this cause be and the same is hereby affirmed with costs.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
