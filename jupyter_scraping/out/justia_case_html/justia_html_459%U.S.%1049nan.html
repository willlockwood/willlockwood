It would be more accurate to say that the Second Circuit held that lack of reference to federal law does not control the determination whether a federal claim is presented by the complaint. In the present case, as the dissent explains, post, at 1052, the issue, is whether "a defendant\'s federal pre-emption claim presents a federal question." In other words, the issue is </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1050">Page 459 U.S. 1049 , 1050</a></p><p> whether a federal question is presented by a federal defense to a state law claim. If a federal claim is presented by the complaint, there is federal question jurisdiction even if the complaint is phrased in state law terms; if, however, the complaint presents only a state law claim, a federal defense does not create federal question jurisdiction. </p><p> I thus perceive no conflict between the present case and North American Phillips, and no conflict between the present case and other cases cited by petitioner. In each of those cases, the courts followed Mottley and focused on the federal basis for the plaintiff\'s claim. Here, in contrast, the plaintiff\'s claim has no federal basis. The plaintiff could not have stated a federal cause of action no matter how it pleaded its case.

The United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois denied the State\'s motion to remand the case to the state court. The District Court found that the complaint necessarily involved the interpretation of federal law and thus was a claim "arising under . . . the laws of the United States" within the meaning of the removal statute, 28 U.S.C. 1441( b).* The complaint was dismissed by the District Court on preemption grounds. </p><p> On appeal, the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that removal was improper. The Court of Appeals found that the State\'s complaint did not rely on or even allude to federal statutes or case law and that there was no basis for concluding that the State had drafted the complaint in order to defeat removal. Illinois v. Kerr-McGee Chemical Corp., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/677/571/">677 F.2d 571</a>, 577 (CA7 1982). The issue of federal preemption, the court held, is "merely a defense to state law claims;" a defense based on federal law cannot be a ground for removal. Id., at 578. The District Court\'s decision was reversed and remanded with instructions to remand the case to the state court. Petitioner now seeks review of the Seventh Circuit\'s decision. </p><p> The holding in the present case is in direct conflict with a decision in the Second Circuit, North American Phillips Corp. v. Emery Air Freight Corp., <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/579/229/">579 F.2d 229</a> (CA2 1978). In North American Phillips, the Second Circuit found that the lack of reference to federal law in the complaint does not control the determination whether a federal question is presented . The court held that the substance of the allegations </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1052">Page 459 U.S. 1049 , 1052</a></p><p> must be reviewed in order to determine "whether a federal law is a pivotal issue in the case, one that is basic in the determination of the conflict between the parties." Id., at 233. </p><p> The issue whether, or under what circumstances, a defendant\'s federal preemption claim presents a federal question sufficient to support removal of a state plaintiff\'s complaint which on its face raises only state claims, is a substantial one going to the heart of the power of federal courts to determine claims raised in state court proceedings. The Court should grant this case to resolve the conflict. Accordingly, I dissent from the denial of certiorari. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p>[<a href="#T*" name="F*">Footnote *</a>] Section 1441(b) provides:</p><ul>"Any civil action of which the district courts have original jurisdiction founded on a claim or right arising under the Constitution, treaties or laws of the United States shall be removable without regard to the citizenship or residence of the parties. Any other such action shall be removable only if none of the parties in interest properly joined and served as defendants is a citizen of the State in which such action is brought." 28 U.S.C. 1441(b). </ul> <p>\n</p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
