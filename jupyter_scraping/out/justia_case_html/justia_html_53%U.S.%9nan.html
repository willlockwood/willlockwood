It would not be admissible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="18">Page 53 U.

Where a statute may be ambiguous in its language or may have reference to facts or conclusions dependent on usage, the influence of opinion or the proof of established usage may be proper or even indispensable in fixing the just interpretation of the law, but it is only in instances like these last mentioned that such a rule of interpretation can be tolerated.</p>\n<p>The question presented upon the certificate from the circuit court will be considered 1st with reference to the language of the Tariff Act of July 30, 1846, and next upon the import of the facts proved in the case, upon the hypothesis that those facts could at all affect the rule of interpretation.</p>\n<p>In schedule B, part of the act above-mentioned, laying an impost of 40 percentum on all articles embraced within it, the only description of glass mentioned is that designated as <em>"glass cut."</em>  Its distinguishing characteristic that brings the article within the purview of that schedule is that it be cut; the figure or the extent in which the process of cutting should have been applied was nowhere defined by the statute, and it must be obvious that any attempt to define or describe that which may and must indeed be as diverse as the skill, the taste, or the prospect of profit on the part of the manufacturer would have been utterly nugatory.  But it could be easily understood both by the lawmaker and by others that the beauty, the quality, and the price of glass are heightened by the process of cutting, and it was equally notorious or susceptible of proof that the process of cutting is accomplished by but one species of operation, <em>viz.,</em> the operation of grinding.  It would appear plain then, that all glass subjected to this one known process, as being enhanced in value, was designed to fall within the description in the statute of <em>"glass cut."</em></p>\n<p>The articles of glassware enumerated in schedule C as being subject to an impost of 30 percentum are thus described, <em>viz.,</em> glass tumblers plain, moulded, or pressed, <em>"not cut or punted."</em>  Upon the language of the description just quoted it would seem too clear for cavil that cut or punted tumblers cannot be placed in the same class with those that are enumerated as "<em>plain, moulded,</em> or <em>pressed,</em>" but are carefully contradistinguished from these last denominations.  <em>Cut</em> or <em>punted</em> tumblers, therefore, even if these two terms could be understood as having different significations and were not applicable merely to different degrees of cutting or grinding, do not fall under the lower rate of duty -- but all </p><p><a class="page-number" name="19">Page 53 U. S. 19</a></p><p> cut tumblers, no matter in what part, in what figures or to what extent they are cut, and all <em>punted</em> tumblers were by the Act of Congress of July 30, 1846, subject to a duty of 40 percent upon the proper construction of the language of the statute.  An effort has been made to control this language by introducing the opinions of certain dealers in glass and of other persons in the City of New York to show that tumblers, the entire bottom of which are ground or smoothed by the glass-cutter, and tumblers the sides of which are wrought and ornamented by the same means, are not considered as <em>cut,</em> but are held to be the first <em>plain,</em> and the second <em>engraved</em> tumblers.  The sum of the argument thus attempted, when tested by common sense, amounts to this:  that the process of grinding or cutting, when applied to the entire surface of the bottom of tumblers or to the ornamenting of their sides, although it be the identical process and the only one by which cut glass is manufactured, is not cutting, but something less, and that the manufacturing of cut glass means something else or beyond the only process by which cut glass is ever made.  The integrity or indeed the intelligibility of this argument this Court is unable to perceive.  It cannot be sustained in opposition to the language of the statute, in violation of consistency, and against the weight of the testimony in the cause, upon mere arbitrary and unfounded assumption or upon opinion entertained within a limited theater, and this by persons whose interests are involved in and would be advanced by that assumption.  The weakness of this assumption is further exposed by recurrence to facts stated by manufacturers and found in the record, in strict conformity with which the distinction made in the statute appears to have been taken.</p>\n<p>Thus it is proved that tumblers are manufactured either entirely by the glass-blower or in part by the glass-blower and in part by the cutter or grinder, and <em>that glass-blowing and glass-cutting are distinct and separate trades and processes of manufacture.</em>  It is further shown in proof that the bottoms of tumblers manufactured entirely by the glass-blower are rough in the center, being there broken off from the punt or stick in which they are made; that after their completion as far as can be by the glass-blower, they pass into the hands of the cutter or grinder, by whom the center of the bottom is cut or smoothed, and that the process of thus cutting or smoothing the center of the bottoms of these tumblers is called <em>punting.</em>  Again it is in proof that the tumblers, as made by the glass-blower, are frequently passed to the cutter or grinder, by whom the <em>entire surface</em> of the bottom is cut or smoothed, and it is the tumbler, thus cut and finished by the glass cutter, that is said to be known in the trade in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="20">Page 53 U. S. 20</a></p><p> New York as "the plain tumbler" or as the "plain, smoothed-bottomed tumbler."  It is also proved that the cutting and smoothing the bottom of the tumbler is effected by the identical process which is applied in <em>punting,</em> the only difference consisting in the fact that in the former operation, it extends to the <em>entire surface,</em> instead of being limited to the point at which the tumbler was separated from the punt or stick.  "Cut or punted tumblers are expressly distinguished in the statute from glass tumblers, <em>plain, moulded, or pressed.</em>"  Punted tumblers, it is clearly shown by the facts certified, are made by the operation of cutting or grinding the center of the bottom; the smoothing of the entire bottoms of tumblers is merely the application of the same process to a greater extent; how this extended application can cause those tumblers subjected to it to be considered less as <em>cut glass</em> than if they were merely punted or cut at a small point of the bottom presents a problem not easy of solution.  Could these tumblers, with the entire bottom or sides cut or ground, be, with any propriety of language denominated "plain tumblers," or "plain, smoothed-bottomed tumblers," they still are not the less "plain tumblers," or "plain, smoothed-bottomed tumblers," or "plain tumblers with flattened bottoms," or "engraved tumblers" so constituted by the operation of <em>cutting or grinding.</em>  In this view of the question certified, it is the opinion of this Court that glass tumblers having the entire surface or bottom smoothed or polished, or their sides figured or ornamented by cutting or grinding, come regularly within the operation of schedule B of the Tariff Act of July 30, 1846, and are, within the intent and meaning of that schedule, subject to a duty of 40 percentum <em>ad valorem,</em> as <em>glass cut,</em> and we order it to be</p>\n<p><em>So certified to the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York.</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Order</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of New York, and on the point or question on which the judges of the said circuit court were opposed in opinion, and which was certified to this Court for its opinion, agreeably to the act of Congress in such case made and provided, and was argued by counsel.  On consideration whereof, it is the opinion of this Court that according to the true construction of the Act of Congress of 30 July, 1846, entitled "An act reducing the duty on imports, and for other purposes," glass tumblers the bottoms of which have been smoothed or flattened by the process of cutting or grinding, and glass tumblers which have been </p><p><a class="page-number" name="21">Page 53 U. S. 21</a></p><p> engraved on the sides by a similar process, should be charged with the duty of 40 percentum <em>ad valorem</em> under schedule B of said act as cut glass.  Whereupon it is now here ordered and adjudged by this Court that it be so certified to the said circuit court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
