S. 392</a>, 405, 406.  While Rubina Husain (hereinafter respondent) and her husband, Dr. Hanson, were traveling overseas, she requested that petitioner Olympic Airways provide seats away from the smoking section because Dr. Hanson had asthma and was sensitive to secondhand smoke.  After boarding, they discovered that their seats were only three rows in front of the smoking section.  A flight attendant refused respondent\xe2\x80\x99s three requests to move Dr. Hanson.  As the smoking noticeably increased, Dr. Hanson walked toward the front of the plane to get fresher air.  He then received medical assistance but died.  Respondents filed a wrongful-death suit in state court, which was removed to federal court.  The District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death, and the Ninth Circuit affirmed, concluding that, under <em>Saks\xe2\x80\x99</em> definition of \xe2\x80\x9caccident,\xe2\x80\x9d the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson was clearly external to him, and unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of the requested accommodation.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The conduct here constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17.

The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Saks</em> sheds light on whether the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to assist a passenger in a medical crisis is the proper focus of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  In <em>Saks</em>, the Court focused on \xe2\x80\x9cwhat causes can be considered accidents,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 U. S., at 404, and did not suggest that only one event could be the \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, the Court recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny injury is the product of a chain of causes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 406.  Thus, for purposes of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, a plaintiff need only prove that \xe2\x80\x9csome link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Petitioner does not dispute that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was unusual or unexpected, arguing only that her conduct was irrelevant to the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  Petitioner argues that ambient cigarette smoke was the relevant injury producing event.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the ambient cigarette smoke neglects the reality that multiple interrelated factual events often combine to cause a given injury.  Any one of these events or happenings may be a link in the chain of causes and\xe2\x80\x94so long as it is unusual or unexpected\xe2\x80\x94could constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17.  470 U. S., at 406.  The flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal on three separate occasions to move Dr. Hanson was a factual event that the District Court correctly found to be a \xe2\x80\x9clink in the chain\xe2\x80\x9d of causes leading to his death.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the attendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d because only affirmative acts are events or happenings under <em>Saks</em> is also unavailing.  The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chappening\xe2\x80\x9d under these terms\xe2\x80\x99 ordinary and usual definitions, and other provisions of the Convention suggest that there is often no distinction between action and inaction on the ultimate liability issue, see, <em>e.g.,</em> Art. 25.  Finally, although the Ninth Circuit improperly seemed to approve of a negligence-based approach to the accident inquiry, no party disputes that court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected and unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d which is the operative language under <em>Saks</em> and the correct Article 17 analysis.

In <em>Air France </em>v. <em>Saks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/392/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/392/index.html">470 U. S. 392</a> (1985), the Court explained that the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d in the Convention refers to an \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger,\xe2\x80\x9d and not to \xe2\x80\x9cthe passenger\xe2\x80\x99s own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 405, 406.  The issue we must decide is whether the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d condition precedent to air carrier liability under Article 17 is satisfied when the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s unusual and unexpected refusal to assist a passenger is a link in a chain of causation resulting in a passenger\xe2\x80\x99s pre-existing medical condition being aggravated by exposure to a normal condition in the aircraft cabin.  We conclude that it is.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following facts are taken from the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings, which, being unchallenged by either party, we accept as true.  In December 1997, Dr. Abid Hanson and his wife, Rubina Husain (hereinafter respondent), traveled with their children and another family from San Francisco to Athens and Cairo for a family vacation.  During a stopover in New York, Dr. Hanson learned for the first time that petitioner allowed its passengers to smoke on international flights.  Because Dr. Hanson had suffered from asthma and was sensitive to secondhand smoke, respondent requested and obtained seats away from the smoking section.  Dr. Hanson experienced no problems on the flights to Cairo.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the return flights, Dr. Hanson and respondent arrived early at the Cairo airport in order to request non-smoking seats.  Respondent showed the check-in agent a physician\xe2\x80\x99s letter explaining that Dr. Hanson \xe2\x80\x9chas [a] history of recurrent anaphylactic reactions,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 81, and asked the agent to ensure that their seats were in the non-smoking section.  The flight to Athens was uneventful.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After boarding the plane for the flight to San Francisco, Dr. Hanson and respondent discovered that their seats were located only three rows in front of the economy-class smoking section.  Respondent advised Maria Leptourgou, a flight attendant for petitioner, that Dr. Hanson could not sit in a smoking area, and said, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98You have to move him.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  116 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1121, 1125 (ND Cal. 2000).  The flight attendant told her to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98have a seat.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  After all the passengers had boarded but prior to takeoff, respondent again asked Ms. Leptourgou to move Dr. Hanson, explaining that he was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98allergic to smoke.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Ms. Leptourgou replied that she could not reseat Dr. Hanson because the plane was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98totally full\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and she was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo busy\xe2\x80\x9d to help.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Shortly after takeoff, passengers in the smoking section began to smoke, and Dr. Hanson was soon surrounded by ambient cigarette smoke.  Respondent spoke with Ms. Leptourgou a third time, stating, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98You have to move my husband from here.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 1126.  Ms. Leptourgou again refused, stating that the plane was full.  Ms. Leptourgou told respondent that Dr. Hanson could switch seats with another passenger, but that respondent would have to ask other passengers herself, without the flight crew\xe2\x80\x99s assistance.  Respondent told Ms. Leptourgou that Dr. Hanson had to move even if the only available seat was in the cockpit or in business class, but Ms. Leptourgou refused to provide any assistance.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About two hours into the flight, the smoking noticeably increased in the rows behind Dr. Hanson.  Dr. Hanson asked respondent for a new inhaler because the one he had been using was empty.  Dr. Hanson then moved toward the front of the plane to get some fresher air.  While he was leaning against a chair near the galley area, Dr. Hanson gestured to respondent to get his emergency kit.  Respondent returned with it and gave him a shot of epinephrine.  She then awoke Dr. Umesh Sabharwal, an allergist, with whom Dr. Hanson and respondent had been traveling.  Dr. Sabharwal gave Dr. Hanson another shot of epinephrine and began to administer CPR and oxygen.  Dr. Hanson died shortly thereafter.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 1128.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents filed a wrongful-death suit in California state court.  Petitioner removed the case to federal court, and the District Court found petitioner liable for Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death.  The District Court held that Ms. Leptourgou\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson constituted an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of Article 17.  Applying <em>Saks</em>\xe2\x80\x99 definition of that term, the court reasoned that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was external to Dr. Hanson and, because it was in \xe2\x80\x9cblatant disregard of industry standards and airline policies,\xe2\x80\x9d was not expected or usual.  116 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1134.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Ninth Circuit affirmed.  Applying <em>Saks</em>\xe2\x80\x99 definition of \xe2\x80\x9caccident,\xe2\x80\x9d the Ninth Circuit agreed that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to reseat Dr. Hanson \xe2\x80\x9cwas clearly external to Dr. Hanson, and it was unexpected and unusual in light of industry standards, Olympic policy, and the simple nature of Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s requested accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 F.\xc2\xa03d 829, 837 (2002).  We granted certiorari, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/1056/index.html">538 U. S. 1056</a> (2003), and now affirm.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We begin with the language of Article 17 of the Convention, which provides:[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe carrier shall be liable for damage sustained in the event of the death or wounding of a passenger or any other bodily injury suffered by a passenger, if the accident which caused the damage so sustained took place on board the aircraft or in the course of any of the operations of embarking or disembarking.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 Stat. 3018.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn <em>Saks</em>, the Court recognized that the text of the Convention does not define the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d and that the context in which it is used is not \xe2\x80\x9cilluminating.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U. S., at 399.  The Court nevertheless discerned the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d from the Convention\xe2\x80\x99s text, structure, and history as well as from the subsequent conduct of the parties to the Convention.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither party here contests <em>Saks</em>\xe2\x80\x99 definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17 of the Convention.  Rather, the parties differ as to which <em>event</em> should be the focus of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Saks</em> sheds light on whether the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to assist a passenger in a medical crisis is the proper focus of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Saks</em>, the Court addressed whether a passenger\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98loss of hearing proximately caused by normal operation of the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s pressurization system\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d was an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98accident.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 395.  The Court concluded that it was not, because the injury was her \xe2\x80\x9cown internal reaction\xe2\x80\x9d to the normal pressurization of the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.  <em>Id</em>., at 406.  The Court noted two textual clues to the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  First, the Convention distinguishes between liability under Article 17 for death or injuries to passengers caused by an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d and liability under Article 18 for destruction or loss of baggage caused by an \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 398.  The difference in these provisions implies that the meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d is different from that of \xe2\x80\x9coccurrence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Second, the Court found significant the fact that Article 17 focuses on the \xe2\x80\x9caccident which caused\xe2\x80\x9d the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s injury and not an accident that is the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s injury.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The Court explained that it is the cause of the injury\xe2\x80\x94rather than the occurrence of the injury\xe2\x80\x94that must satisfy the definition of \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 399.  And recognizing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s responsibility to read the treaty in a manner \xe2\x80\x9cconsistent with the shared expectations of the contracting parties,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., the Court also looked to the French legal meaning of the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident,\xe2\x80\x9d which when used to describe the cause of an injury, is usually defined as a \xe2\x80\x9cfortuitous, unexpected, unusual, or unintended event.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 400.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the Court held in <em>Saks </em>that an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17 is \xe2\x80\x9can unexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger,\xe2\x80\x9d and not \xe2\x80\x9cthe passenger\xe2\x80\x99s own internal reaction to the usual, normal, and expected operation of the aircraft.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 405, 406.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The Court emphasized that the definition of \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cshould be flexibly applied after assessment of all the circumstances surrounding a passenger\xe2\x80\x99s injuries.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 405.  The Court further contemplated that intentional conduct could fall within the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d definition under Article 17,[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] an interpretation that comports with another provision of the Convention.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  As such, <em>Saks</em> correctly characterized the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d as encompassing more than unintentional conduct.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court focused its analysis on determining \xe2\x80\x9cwhat causes<em> </em>can be considered accidents,\xe2\x80\x9d and observed that Article 17 \xe2\x80\x9cembraces causes<em> </em>of injuries\xe2\x80\x9d that are \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected or unusual.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 404, 405.  The Court did not suggest that only one event could constitute the<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9caccident,\xe2\x80\x9d recognizing that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny injury is the product of a chain of causes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 406.  Thus, for purposes of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry, the Court stated that a plaintiff need only be able to prove that \xe2\x80\x9csome link in the chain was an unusual or unexpected event external to the passenger.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry should focus on the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioner 4, which, according to petitioner, was the presence of ambient cigarette smoke in the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.  Because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s policies permitted smoking on international flights, petitioner contends that Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death resulted from his own internal reaction\xe2\x80\x94namely, an asthma attack\xe2\x80\x94to the normal operation of the aircraft.  Petitioner also argues that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to move Dr. Hanson was inaction, whereas Article 17 requires an action that causes the injury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We disagree.  As an initial matter, we note that petitioner did not challenge in the Court of Appeals the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in three times refusing to move Dr. Hanson was unusual or unexpected in light of the relevant industry standard or petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s own company policy.  116 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1133.  Petitioner instead argued that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was irrelevant for purposes of the \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry and that the only relevant event was the presence of the ambient cigarette smoke in the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s cabin.  Consequently, we need not dispositively determine whether the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct qualified as \xe2\x80\x9cunusual or unexpected\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Saks</em>, but may assume that it was for purposes of this opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s focus on the ambient cigarette smoke as the injury producing event is misplaced.  We do not doubt that the presence of ambient cigarette smoke in the aircraft\xe2\x80\x99s cabin during an international flight might have been \xe2\x80\x9cnormal\xe2\x80\x9d at the time of the flight in question.  But petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry\xe2\x80\x94which looks to \xe2\x80\x9cthe precise factual \xe2\x80\x98event\xe2\x80\x99 that caused the injury\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94neglects the reality that there are often multiple interrelated factual events that combine to cause any given injury.  Brief for Petitioner 14.  In <em>Saks</em>, the Court recognized that any one of these factual events or happenings may be a link in the chain of causes and\xe2\x80\x94so long as it is unusual or unexpected\xe2\x80\x94could constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17.  470 U.

Indeed, the very fact that multiple events will necessarily combine and interrelate to cause any particular injury makes it difficult to define, in any coherent or non-question-begging way, any single event as <em>the</em> \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s only claim to the contrary here is to say: \xe2\x80\x9cLooking to the purely factual description of relevant events, the aggravating event was Dr. Hanson remaining in his assigned non-smoking seat and being exposed to ambient smoke, which allegedly aggravated his pre-existing asthmatic condition leading to his death,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 24, and that the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event\xe2\x80\x9d was \xe2\x80\x9cnot the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act or violation of industry standards,\xe2\x80\x9d Reply Brief for Petitioner 9\xe2\x80\x9310.  Petitioner ignores the fact that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal on three separate occasions to move Dr. Hanson was also a \xe2\x80\x9cfactual \xe2\x80\x98event,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 14, that the District Court correctly found to be a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98link in the chain\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of causes that led to Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death.  116 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1135.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s statement that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to reseat Dr. Hanson was not the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event\xe2\x80\x9d is nothing more than a bald assertion, unsupported by any law or argument.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An example illustrates why petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis on the ambient cigarette smoke as the \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event\xe2\x80\x9d is misplaced.  Suppose that petitioner mistakenly assigns respondent and her husband to seats in the middle of the smoking section, and that respondent and her husband do not notice that they are in the smoking section until after the flight has departed.  Suppose further that, as here, the flight attendant refused to assist respondent and her husband despite repeated requests to move.  In this hypothetical case, it would appear that, \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ooking to the purely factual description of relevant events, the aggravating event was [the passenger] remaining in his assigned \xe2\x80\xa6 seat and being exposed to ambient smoke, which allegedly aggravated his pre-existing asthmatic condition leading to his death.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 24.  To argue otherwise, petitioner would have to suggest that the misassignment to the smoking section was <em>the</em> \xe2\x80\x9cinjury producing event,\xe2\x80\x9d but this would simply beg the question.  The fact is, the exposure to smoke, the misassignment to the smoking section, and the refusal to move the passenger would all be factual events contributing to the death of the passenger.  In the instant case, the same can be said: The exposure to the smoke and the refusal to assist the passenger are happenings that both contributed to the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s death.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s failure to act cannot constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d because only affirmative acts are \xe2\x80\x9cevent[s] or happening[s]\xe2\x80\x9d under <em>Saks</em> is unavailing.  470 U. S., at 405.  The distinction between action and inaction, as petitioner uses these terms, would perhaps be relevant were this a tort law negligence case.  But respondents do not advocate, and petitioner vigorously rejects, that a negligence regime applies under Article 17 of the Convention.  The relevant \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry under <em>Saks</em> is whether there is \xe2\x80\x9can unexpected or unusual <em>event or happening</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis added).  The rejection of an explicit request for assistance would be an \xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9chappening\xe2\x80\x9d under the ordinary and usual definitions of these terms.  See American Heritage Dictionary 635 (3d ed. 1992) (\xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9c[s]omething that takes place; an occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d); Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 554\xe2\x80\x93555 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cSomething that happens\xe2\x80\x9d); Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 885 (2d ed. 1957) (\xe2\x80\x9cevent\xe2\x80\x9d: \xe2\x80\x9cThe fact of taking place or occurring; occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hat which comes, arrives, or happens\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the fallacy of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s position that an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d cannot take the form of inaction is illustrated by the following example.  Suppose that a passenger on a flight inexplicably collapses and stops breathing and that a medical doctor informs the flight crew that the passenger\xe2\x80\x99s life could be saved only if the plane lands within one hour.  Suppose further that it is industry standard and airline policy to divert a flight to the nearest airport when a passenger otherwise faces imminent death.  If the plane is within 30 minutes of a suitable airport, but the crew chooses to continue its cross-country flight, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he notion that this is not an unusual event is staggering.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>McCaskey </em>v. <em>Continental Airlines, Inc</em>., 159 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 562, 574 (SD Tex. 2001).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Confirming this interpretation, other provisions of the Convention suggest that there is often no distinction between action and inaction on the issue of ultimate liability.  For example, Article 25 provides that Article 22\xe2\x80\x99s liability cap does not apply in the event of \xe2\x80\x9cwilful mis-\nconduct or \xe2\x80\xa6 such <em>default</em> on [the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s] part as, in accordance with the law of the court to which the case is submitted, is considered to be equivalent to wilful misconduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 Stat. 3020 (emphasis added).[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Because liability can be imposed for death or bodily injury only in the case of an Article 17 \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d and Article 25 only lifts the caps once liability has been found, these provisions read together tend to show that inaction can give rise to liability.  Moreover, Article 20(1) makes clear that the \xe2\x80\x9cdue care\xe2\x80\x9d defense is unavailable when a carrier has <em>failed </em>to take \xe2\x80\x9call necessary measures to avoid the damage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 3019.  These provisions suggest that an air carrier\xe2\x80\x99s inaction can be the basis for liability.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner contends that the Ninth Circuit improperly created a negligence-based \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d standard under Article 17 by focusing on the flight crew\xe2\x80\x99s negligence as the \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Ninth Circuit stated: \xe2\x80\x9cThe failure to act in the face of a known, serious risk satisfies the meaning of \xe2\x80\x98accident\xe2\x80\x99 within Article 17 so long as reasonable alternatives exist that would substantially minimize the risk and implementing these alternatives would not unreasonably interfere with the normal, expected operation of the airplane.\xe2\x80\x9d  316 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 837.  Admittedly, this language does seem to approve of a negligence-based approach.  However, no party disputes the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s conduct was \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected and unusual,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>., which is the operative language under <em>Saks</em> and the correct Article 17 analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the conduct here constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17 of the Warsaw Convention.

On the one hand, as noted in <em>Saks</em>, \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d may be defined as an unintended<em> </em>event.  See Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New World College Dictionary 8 (4th ed. 1999) (\xe2\x80\x9ca happening that is not \xe2\x80\xa6 intended\xe2\x80\x9d); see also American Heritage Dictionary 10 (4th ed. 2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[l]ack of intention; chance\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Saks</em>, 470 U.

On the other hand, as noted in <em>Saks</em>, the term \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d may be defined as an event that is \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected,\xe2\x80\x9d whether the result of intentional action or not.  <em>Ibid.</em>  See Black\xe2\x80\x99s Law Dictionary 15 (6th ed. 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9can unusual, fortuitous, unexpected, unforeseen, or unlooked for event, happening or occurrence\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cif happening wholly or partly through human agency, an event which under the circumstances is unusual and unexpected by the person to whom it happens\xe2\x80\x9d); see also American Heritage Dictionary, <em>supra</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[a]n unexpected and undesirable event,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c[a]n unforeseen incident\xe2\x80\x9d).  Although either definition of \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d is at first glance plausible, neither party contests the definition adopted by the Court in <em>Saks</em>, which after careful examination discerned the meaning of \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17 of the Convention as an \xe2\x80\x9cunexpected or unusual event or happening that is external to the passenger.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 U.

The United Kingdom court reasoned: \xe2\x80\x9cThe refusal of the flight attendant to move Dr. Hanson cannot properly be considered as mere inertia, or a non-event.

The word \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d is used in two distinct senses.

As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, n.\xc2\xa06, <em>Saks</em> adopted the latter definition rather than the former.  That distinction is crucial\nbecause, while there is no doubt that inaction can be\nan accident in the former sense (\xe2\x80\x9cI accidentally left the stove on\xe2\x80\x9d), whether it can be so in the latter sense is\nquestionable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Two of our sister signatories have concluded that it cannot.  In <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis and Air Travel Group Litigation</em>, [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, 2003 WL 21353471 (July 3, 2003), England\xe2\x80\x99s Court of Appeal, in an opinion by the Master of the Rolls that relied heavily on <em>Abramson </em>v. <em>Japan Airlines Co.</em>, 739 F.\xc2\xa02d 130 (CA3 1984), and analyzed more than a half-dozen other non-English decisions, held as follows:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cA critical issue in this appeal is whether a failure to act, or an omission, can constitute an accident for the purposes of Article 17.  Often a failure to act results in an accident, or forms part of a series of acts and omissions which together constitute an accident.  In such circumstances it may not be easy to distinguish between acts and omissions.  I cannot see, however, how inaction itself can ever properly be described as an accident.  It is not an event; it is a non-event.  Inaction is the antithesis of an accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, \xc2\xb6  ;25, 2003 WL 21353471 (Lord Phillips, M.\xc2\xa0R.).  </p>\n<p align="left">\nSix months later, the appellate division of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia, in an opinion that likewise gave extensive consideration to American and other foreign decisions, agreed:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe allegations in substance do no more than state a failure to do something, and this cannot be characterised as an event or happening, whatever be the concomitant background to that failure to warn or advise.  That is not to say that a failure to take a specific required step in the course of flying an aircraft, or in picking up or setting down passengers, cannot lead to an event or happening of the requisite unusual or unexpected kind and thus be an accident for the purpose of the article.  A failure by a pilot to use some device in the expected and correct manner, such as a failure to let down the landing wheels or a chance omission to adjust the level of pressurisation, may lead, as has been held, to an accident contemplated by Article 17, but I would venture to suggest that it is not the failure to take the step which is properly to be characterised as an accident but rather its immediate and disastrous consequence whether that be the dangerous landing on the belly of the aircraft or an immediate unexpected and dangerous drop in pressurisation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Qantas Ltd.</em> v. <em>Povey</em>, [2003] VSCA 227, \xc2\xb6  ;17, 2003 WL 23000692 (Dec. 23, 2003) (Ormiston, J. A.).  </p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We can, and should, look to decisions of other signatories when we interpret treaty provisions.  Foreign constructions are evidence of the original shared understanding of the contracting parties.  Moreover, it is reasonable to impute to the parties an intent that their respective courts strive to interpret the treaty consistently.  (The Warsaw Convention\xe2\x80\x99s preamble specifically acknowledges \xe2\x80\x9cthe advantage of regulating <em>in a uniform manner </em>the conditions of \xe2\x80\xa6 the liability of the carrier.\xe2\x80\x9d  49 Stat. 3014 (emphasis added).)  Finally, even if we\ndisagree, we surely owe the conclusions reached by appellate courts of other signatories the courtesy of respectful consideration.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court nonetheless dismisses <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> and <em>Povey</em> in a footnote responding to this dissent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 11, n. 9.  As to the former, it claims (choosing its words carefully) that the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>conclusion</em>\xe2\x80\x9d it reaches<em> </em>is \xe2\x80\x9cnot inconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d with that case.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The reader should not think this to be a contention that the Master of the Rolls\xe2\x80\x99 opinion might be read to agree with today\xe2\x80\x99s holding that inaction can constitute an \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  (To repeat the conclusion of that opinion: \xe2\x80\x9cInaction is the antithesis of an accident.\xe2\x80\x9d  [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, \xc2\xb6  ;25, 2003 WL 21353471.)  What it refers to is the fact that the Master of the Rolls distinguished the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 judgment below (announced in an opinion that assumed inaction was involved, but did not at all discuss the action-inaction distinction) on the ground that action <em>was </em>involved\xe2\x80\x94namely, \xe2\x80\x9cinsistence that [Hanson] remain seated in the area exposed to smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, \xc2\xb6  ;50.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  As I explain below, see Part II, <em>infra</em>, that theory does not quite work because, in fact, the flight attendant did <em>not </em>insist that Hanson remain seated.  But we can ignore this detail for the time being.  The point is that the English court thought Husain could recover, not because the action-inaction distinction was irrelevant, but because, even though action was indispensable, it had in fact occurred.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court charts our course in exactly the opposite direction, spending three pages explaining why the action-inaction distinction <em>is </em>irrelevant.  See <em>ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9313.  If the Court agrees with the Master of the Rolls that this case involves action, why does it needlessly place us in conflict with the courts of other signatories by deciding the then-irrelevant issue of whether inaction can constitute an accident?  It would suffice to hold that our case involves action and end the analysis there.  Whether inaction can constitute an accident under the Warsaw Convention is a significant issue on which international consensus is important; whether Husain can recover for her husband\xe2\x80\x99s death in this one case is not.  As they stand, however, the core holdings of this case and <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em>\xe2\x80\x94their <em>rationes decidendi</em>\xe2\x80\x94are not only <em>not </em>\xe2\x80\x9cnot inconsistent\xe2\x80\x9d; they are <em>completely opposite</em>.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would follow the holdings of <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> and <em>Povey</em>, since the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis today is no more convincing than theirs.  Merely pointing to dictionaries that define \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98event\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98occurrence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]omething that happens,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 10, hardly resolves the problem; it only reformulates one question (whether \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d includes nonevents) into an equivalent one (whether \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d includes nonoccurrences and nonhappenings).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally unavailing is the reliance, <em>ante</em>, at 12\xe2\x80\x9313, on Article 25 of the Warsaw Convention (which lifts liability caps for injury caused by a \xe2\x80\x9cdefault\xe2\x80\x9d of the airline equivalent to willful misconduct) and Article 20 (which precludes the airline\xe2\x80\x99s due-care defense if it fails to take \xe2\x80\x9call necessary measures\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid the injury).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s analytical error in invoking these provisions is to assume that the inaction these provisions contemplate is the accident itself.  The treaty imposes no such requirement.  If a pilot negligently forgets to lower the landing gear, causing the plane to crash and killing all passengers on board, then recovery is presumptively available (because the crash that caused the deaths is an accident), and the due-care defense is inapplicable (because the pilot\xe2\x80\x99s negligent omission also caused the deaths), even though the omission is not the accident.  Similarly, if a flight attendant fails to prevent the boarding of an individual whom she knows to be a terrorist, and who later shoots a passenger, the damages cap might be lifted even though the accident (the shooting) and the default (the failure to prevent boarding) do not coincide.  Without the invented restriction that the Article 20 or 25 default be the accident itself, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument based on those provisions loses all force. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s hypothetical of the crew that refuses to divert after a passenger collapses, <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312: This would be more persuasive as a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> if the Eleventh Circuit had not already ruled out Article 17 liability in substantially these very circumstances.  See <em>Krys</em> v. <em>Lufthansa German Airlines</em>, 119 F.\xc2\xa03d 1515, 1517\xe2\x80\x931522, 1527\xe2\x80\x931528 (1997).  A legal construction is not fallacious merely because it has harsh results.  The Convention denies a remedy, even when outrageous conduct and grievous injury have occurred, unless there has been an \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whatever that term means, it certainly does not equate to \xe2\x80\x9coutrageous conduct that causes grievous injury.\xe2\x80\x9d  It is a mistake to assume that the Convention must provide relief whenever traditional tort law would do so.  To the contrary, a principal object of the Convention was to promote the growth of the fledgling airline industry by limiting the circumstances under which passengers could sue.  See <em>Tseng, </em>525 U. S., at 170\xe2\x80\x93171.  Unless there has been an accident, there is no liability, whether the claim is trivial, cf. <em>Lee </em>v. <em>American Airlines Inc.</em>, 355 F.\xc2\xa03d 386, 387 (CA5 2004) (suit for \xe2\x80\x9closs of a \xe2\x80\x98refreshing, memorable vacation\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d), or cries out for redress.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Were we confronting the issue in the first instance, perhaps the Court could persuade me to its view.  But courts in two other countries have already rejected it, and their reasoning is no less compelling than the Court\xe2\x80\x99s.  I would follow <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> and <em>Povey</em> and hold that mere inaction cannot be an \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d under Article 17.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents argue that, even if the Convention distinguishes action from inaction, this case involves sufficient elements of action to support recovery.  That argument is not implausible; as noted earlier, the court in <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> suggested that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he refusal of the attendant to move [Hanson] could be described as insistence that he remain seated in the area exposed to smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d  [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, \xc2\xb6  ;50, 2003 WL 21353471.  I cannot agree with this analysis, however, because it miscomprehends the facts of this case.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Preliminarily, I must note that this was not the rationale of the District Court.  That court consistently referred to the relevant \xe2\x80\x9caccident\xe2\x80\x9d not as the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that Hanson remain seated, but as her \xe2\x80\x9cfailure\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9crefusal\xe2\x80\x9d to reseat him.  See 116 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1121, 1131\xe2\x80\x931135 (ND Cal. 2000).  Its findings of fact were infected by its erroneous legal assumption that Article 17 makes no distinction between action and inaction.  The only question is whether we can nonetheless affirm on the ground that, since there <em>was</em> action in any event, this error was harmless.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It was not.  True, in response to the <em>first </em>request, the flight attendant insisted that Husain and her husband \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98have a seat.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1125.  This insistence might still have been implicit in her response to the second request.  But these responses were both given while the plane was still on the ground, preparing to take off.  The flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s response to Husain\xe2\x80\x99s <em>third</em> request\xe2\x80\x94made once the plane was in the air and other passengers had started smoking\xe2\x80\x94was quite different.  She did <em>not </em>insist that Husain and her husband remain seated; on the contrary, she invited them to walk around the cabin in search of someone willing to switch.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That the flight attendant explicitly refused Husain\xe2\x80\x99s pleas for help after the third request, rather than simply ignoring them, does not transform her inaction into action.  The refusal acknowledged her inaction, but it was the inaction, not the acknowledgment, that caused Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death.  Unlike the previous responses, the third was a mere refusal to assist, and so cannot be the basis for liability under Article 17.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to make the distinction between the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s pretakeoff responses and her in-flight response undermines its decision in two respects.  First, the court\xe2\x80\x99s findings as to airline and industry policy did not distinguish between reseating a passenger while in flight and reseating a passenger while still on the ground preparing to take off.  In fact, some of the evidence on this point specifically related <em>only </em>to in-flight behavior.  See <em>id.</em>, at 1132 (testimony of a chief cabin attendant that the flight attendant should have reseated Hanson immediately after Husain\xe2\x80\x99s <em>third </em>request); <em>ibid.</em> (testimony of a company official that its policy is to move passengers \xe2\x80\x9cwho become ill <em>during </em>flights\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  To establish that it is company policy to reseat an asthmatic does <em>not </em>establish that it is company policy to do so before takeoff, while the attendants are busy securing the plane for departure and before anyone has started smoking.  In other words, there may have been nothing unusual about the initial insistence that Hanson stay seated, and for that reason no \xe2\x80\x9caccident.\xe2\x80\x9d  We do not know the policy in this more specific regard.  The District Court made no findings because it applied an erroneous legal standard that did not require it to distinguish among the three requests.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But even if the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s insistence that Hanson remain seated before takeoff <em>was </em>unusual or unexpected, and hence an accident, it was not a <em>compensable cause </em>of Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death.  It was perhaps a but-for cause (had the flight attendant allowed him to move before takeoff, he might have lived, just as he might have lived if he had taken a different flight); but it was not a <em>proximate </em>cause, which is surely a predicate for recovery.  Any early insistence that Hanson remain seated became moot once the attendant later told Husain and her husband they were free to move about.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is, however, one complication, which I think requires us to remand this case to the District Court: Although the flight attendant, once the plane was aloft, invited Husain to find another passenger willing to switch seats, she did not invite Husain to find an <em>empty </em>seat, but to the contrary affirmatively represented that the plane was full.  If such a misrepresentation is unusual and unexpected; and (the more difficult question) if it can reasonably be said that it caused Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, that Husain would have searched for and found an empty seat, although unwilling to ask another passenger to move\xe2\x80\x94then a cause of action might lie.  I would remand so that the District Court could consider in the first instance whether the flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s misrepresentation about the plane\xe2\x80\x99s being full, independent of any failure to reseat, was an accident that caused Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death.</p>\n<p align="left">*     *     *</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Tragic though Dr. Hanson\xe2\x80\x99s death may have been, it does not justify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s putting us in needless conflict with other signatories to the Warsaw Convention.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court quotes only part of the relevant discussion.  Here is what the Master of the Rolls said about our case in full:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cI have no difficulty with the result in this case but, with respect, I question the reasoning of the judge in both events.  <em>The refusal of the flight attendant to move Dr. Hanson cannot properly be considered as mere inertia, or a non-event.  </em>It was a refusal to provide an alternative seat which formed part of a more complex incident, whereby Dr. Hanson was exposed to smoke in circumstances that can properly be described as unusual and unexpected.  The existence of the non-smoking zone provided the opportunity for Dr. Hanson, if suitably placed within it, to avoid exposure to the smoke that threatened his health and, as it proved, his life. The direct cause of his death was the unnecessary exposure to the smoke.  <em>The refusal of the attendant to move him could be described as insistence that he remain seated in the area exposed to smoke.</em>  The exposure to smoke in these circumstances could, in my view, properly be described as an unusual or unexpected event.\xe2\x80\x9d  [2003] EWCA Civ. 1005, \xc2\xb6  ;50, 2003 WL 21353471 (emphasis added).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0To the extent the Court implies that <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> and <em>Povey</em> merit only slight consideration because they were not decided by courts of last resort, see <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa09, I note that our prior Warsaw Convention cases have looked to decisions of intermediate appellate foreign courts as well as supreme courts.  See <em>Air France</em> v. <em>Saks,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/392/index.html"></a><a href="/us/470/392/index.html">470 U. S. 392</a>, 404 (1985).  Moreover, <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis</em> was no ordinary decision.  It was authored by the Master of the Rolls, the chief judge of England\xe2\x80\x99s civil appellate court\xe2\x80\x94a position thought by many to be even more influential than that of a Law Lord.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, Smith, Bailey &amp; Gunn on the Modern English Legal System 250 (4th ed. 2002); Denning: A Life of Law, BBC News (Mar. 5, 1999), http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/290996.stm (as visited Jan. 20, 2004) (available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).</p>\n<p>\n\nThat there are \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial factual distinctions\xe2\x80\x9d between the cases, <em>ante</em>, at 11, n.\xc2\xa09, is surely beside the point.  A legal rule may arise in different contexts, but the differences are relevant only if the logic of the rule makes them so.  <em>Deep Vein Thrombosis </em>and <em>Povey</em> hold in no uncertain terms that inaction cannot be an accident; not that inaction <em>consisting of failure to warn of deep vein thrombosis</em> cannot be an accident.  Maintaining a coherent international body of treaty law requires us to give deference to the <em>legal rules</em> our treaty partners adopt.  It is not enough to avoid inconsistent decisions on factually identical cases.  </p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
