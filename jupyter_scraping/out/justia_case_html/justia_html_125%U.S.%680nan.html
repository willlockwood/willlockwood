The net income of the road for the year 1886 was $162,000, earned principally from passenger traffic, the charge for transportation having been five cents per mile, and this has been about the average for recent past years.  With the same traffic that the road has now, and charging for transportation at the rate of three cents per mile, the net income will only be $58,000, which will pay less than one and one-half per cent on the cost of the road, and only a little over two per cent on its bonded indebtedness.  The defendants do not anticipate any increase of traffic on account of the reduction, for the reason that the St. Louis, Iron Mountain and Southern Railway, from which the Memphis and Little Rock Railroad derives nearly all of its through business, is building a parallel branch from Bald Knob in the State of Arkansas to the City of Memphis, and, being a hostile and rival line to that of these defendants, will carry over that branch the through passengers who would otherwise go over the road of the defendants.

They are incorporated as such, and given extraordinary powers, in order that they may better serve the public in that capacity.  They are therefore engaged in a public employment, affecting the public interest, and, under the decision in <em>Munn v. Illinois,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/us/94/113/case.html">94 U.

This company, in the transactions of its business, has the same rights and is subject to the same control as private individuals under the same circumstances.  It must carry when called upon to do so, and can charge only a reasonable sum for the carriage.  In the absence of any legislative regulation upon the subject, the courts must decide for it, as they do for private persons when controversies arise, what is reasonable.  But when the legislature steps in and prescribes a maximum of charge, it operates upon this corporation the same as it does upon individuals engaged in a similar business."</p>\n<p>94 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/155/case.html#161">94 U.

He added, however:</p>\n<p>"From what has thus been said, it is not to be inferred that this power of limitation or regulation is itself without limit.  This power to regulate is not a power to destroy, and limitation is not the equivalent of confiscation.  Under pretense of regulating fares and freights, the state cannot require a railroad company to carry persons and property without reward; neither can it do that which in law amounts to a taking of private property for public use without just compensation or without due process of law."</p>\n<p>116 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/116/307/case.html#331">116 U.

S. 557</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The case at bar is quite clear of any of the questions upon which the members of the Court have heretofore differed in opinion.  If the Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad Company, as reorganized by the purchasers at the sale under the decree of foreclosure of the previous mortgages, was a lawful corporation of the State of Arkansas, it was not the same corporation as that chartered by the legislature in 1853, but was a new corporation, subject to the provisions of the constitution and laws in force when it first came into existence -- that is to say, in 1877.  <em>Memphis &amp; Little Rock Railroad v. Commissioners,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/112/609/case.html">112 U. S. 609</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Constitution of Arkansas of 1874 contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p>"Corporations may be formed under general laws, which laws may, from time to time, be altered or repealed.  The general assembly shall have power to alter, revoke, or annul </p><p><a class="page-number" name="690">Page 125 U. S. 690</a></p><p> any charter of incorporation now existing and revocable at the adoption of this constitution, or that may be hereafter created, whenever in their opinion it may be injurious to the citizens of the state, in such manner, however, that no injustice shall be done to the corporators."</p>\n<p>Art. 12, \xc2\xa7 6.</p>\n<p>"The general assembly shall pass laws to correct abuses and prevent unjust discrimination and excessive charges by railroad, canal, and turnpike companies for transporting freight and passengers, and shall provide for enforcing such laws by adequate penalties and forfeitures."</p>\n<p>Art. 17, \xc2\xa7 10.</p>\n<p>The Legislature of Arkansas, by the statute of April 4, 1887, fixed the maximum fare that any corporation, trustees, or persons operating a line of railroad might charge and collect for carrying a passenger within the state at eight cents a mile on a line fifteen miles long or less, five cents a mile on a line more than fifteen and less than seventy\x1efive miles long, and three cents a mile on a line more than seventy\x1efive miles long.  The line of the road of the plaintiffs in error is more than seventy\x1efive miles long, and they charged more than three cents a mile, and were therefore held to be subject to the penalty imposed by the statute for any violation of its provisions.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs in error do not contend that it is always or generally unreasonable to restrict the rate for carrying each passenger to three cents a mile.  They argue that it is so in this case by reason of the admitted fact that with the same traffic that their road has now, and charging for transportation at the rate of three cents per mile, the net yearly income will pay less than one and a half percent on the original cost of the road, and only a little more than two percent on the amount of its bonded debt.  But there is no evidence whatever as to how much money the bonds cost, or as to the amount of the capital stock of the corporation as reorganized, or as to the sum paid for the road by that corporation or its trustees.  It certainly cannot be presumed that the price paid at the sale under the decree of foreclosure equaled the original cost of the road or the amount of outstanding bonded debt.  Without any proof of the sum invested by the reorganized corporation or its trustees, the Court has no means, if </p><p><a class="page-number" name="691">Page 125 U. S. 691</a></p><p> it would under any circumstances have the power, of determining that the rate of three cents a mile fixed by the legislature is unreasonable.  Still less does it appear that there has been any such confiscation as amounts to a taking of property without due process of law.</p>\n<p>It is equally clear that the plaintiffs in error have not been denied the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p>The legislature, in the exercise of its power of regulating fares and freights, may classify the railroads according to the amount of the business which they have done or appear likely to do.  Whether the classification shall be according to the amount of passengers and freight carried, or of gross or net earnings during a previous year, or according to the simpler and more constant test of the length of the line of the railroad, is a matter within the discretion of the legislature.  If the same rule is applied to all railroads of the same class, there is no violation of the constitutional provision securing to all the equal protection of the laws.</p>\n<p>A similar question was presented and decided in <em>Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad v. Iowa,</em> above cited.  It was there objected that a statute regulating the rate for the carriage of passengers by different classes of railroads according to their gross earnings per mile was in conflict with art. 1, sec. 4, of the Constitution of Iowa, which provides that "all laws of a general nature shall have a uniform operation," and "the general assembly shall not grant to any citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities which, upon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens."  In answering that objection, the Chief Justice said:</p>\n<p>"The statute divides the railroads of the state into classes according to business, and establishes a maximum of rates for each of the classes.  It operates uniformly on each class, and this is all the constitution requires. . . .  It is very clear that a uniform rate of charges for all railroad companies in the state might operate unjustly upon some.  It was proper therefore to provide in some way for an adaptation of the rates to the circumstances of the different roads, and the general assembly, in the exercise of its legislative discretion, has seen fit to do this by a system </p><p><a class="page-number" name="692">Page 125 U. S. 692</a></p><p> of classification.  Whether this was the best that could have been done is not for us to decide. Our province is only to determine whether it could be done at all and under any circumstances.  If it could, the legislature must decide for itself, subject to no control from us, whether the common good requires that it should be done."</p>\n<p>94 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/94/155/case.html#163">94 U.
