It upheld the reasoning of the lower courts and rejected a jurisdictional defense (raised for the first time on appeal) that sovereign immunity barred the judgment entered against the Government. We granted certiorari. 501 U. S. 1216 (1991).</p><p style="text-align: center;">\nII</p><p>Section 106 of the Bankruptcy Code provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"(a) A governmental unit is deemed to have waived sovereign immunity with respect to any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate and that arose out of the same transaction or occurrence out of which such governmental unit\'s claim arose.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(b) There shall be offset against an allowed claim or interest of a governmental unit any claim against such governmental unit that is property of the estate.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(1) a provision of this title that contains \'creditor,\' \'entity,\' or \'governmental unit\' applies to governmental units; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds governmental units." 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 106.</p></blockquote><p>Three Terms ago we construed this provision in <i>Hoffman </i>v. <i>Connecticut Dept. of Income Maintenance, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/492/96/case.html">492 U. S. 96</a> (1989). The issue there was whether \xc2\xa7 106(c) authorizes a monetary recovery against a State. We held that it does not, though the Justices supporting that judgment failed to agree as to why. A plurality of the Court determined that \xc2\xa7 106(c) does not permit a bankruptcy court to issue mone-</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">33</a></p><p>tary relief against a State. <i>Id., </i>at 102 (WHITE, J., joined by REHNQUIST, C. J., and O\'CONNOR and KENNEDY, JJ.). That conclusion, the plurality said, was compelled by the language of \xc2\xa7 106(c), the relationship between that subsection and the rest of the statute, and the requirement that congressional abrogation of the States\' Eleventh Amendment immunity be clearly expressed. The concurrence found it unnecessary to construe the statute, concluding that Congress lacks authority under the Bankruptcy Clause to abrogate the States\' immunity from money-damages actions. <i>Id., </i>at 105 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment). Like the Court of Appeals here, a dissent determined that the language of \xc2\xa7 106(c), particularly that of paragraph (c)(l), supplies the necessary waiver. <i>Id., </i>at 106 (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, BLACKMUN, and STEVENS, JJ.).</p><p>Contrary to the Government\'s suggestion, <i>Hoffman </i>does not control today\'s decision. It is true, to be sure, that Congress made clear in \xc2\xa7 106 that (insofar as is within Congress\' power) state and federal sovereigns are to be treated the same for immunity purposes. See 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 101(27) (1982 ed., Supp. II) (" \'governmental unit\' means United States [and] State"). Since, however, the Court in <i>Hoffman </i>was evenly divided over what that treatment <i>was </i>as to the States; and since the deciding vote of the concurrence, denying amenability to suit, rested upon a ground (the Eleventh Amendment) applicable only to the States and not to the Federal Government, see <i>Federal Housing Authority </i>v. <i>Burr, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/309/242/case.html">309 U. S. 242</a>, 244 (1940); the holding in <i>Hoffman </i>has no binding force here. The separate opinions dealing with the statutory question are relevant, however, and we shall in fact rely on the reasoning of the plurality.</p><p style="text-align: center;">\nIII</p><p>Waivers of the Government\'s sovereign immunity, to be effective, must be "\'unequivocally expressed.\'" <i>Irwin </i>v.</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">34</a></p><p><i>Department of Veterans Affairs, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/498/89/case.html">498 U. S. 89</a>, 95 (1990) (quoting <i>United States </i>v. <i>Mitchell, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/535/case.html">445 U. S. 535</a>, 538 (1980), and <i>United States </i>v. <i>King, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/395/1/case.html">395 U. S. 1</a>, 4 (1969)). Contrary to respondent\'s suggestion, moreover, they are not generally to be "liberally construed." We have on occasion narrowly construed exceptions to waivers of sovereign immunity where that was consistent with Congress\' clear intent, as in the context of the "sweeping language" of the Federal Tort Claims Act, <i>United States </i>v. <i>Yellow Cab Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/340/543/case.html">340 U. S. 543</a>, 547 (1951), see, <i>e. g., id., </i>at 554-555, <i>Block </i>v. <i>Neal, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/460/289/case.html">460 U. S. 289</a>, 298 (1983), <i>United States </i>v. <i>Aetna Casualty </i>&amp; <i>Surety </i><i>Co., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/338/366/case.html">338 U. S. 366</a>, 383 (1949), or as in the context of equally broad "sue and be sued" clauses, see, <i>e. g., Franchise Tax Bd. of California </i>v. <i>United States Postal Service, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/512/case.html">467 U. S. 512</a>, 517-519 (1984), <i>FHA </i>v. <i>Burr, supra, </i>at 245. These cases do not, however, eradicate the traditional principle that the Government\'s consent to be sued "must be \'construed strictly in favor of the sovereign,\' <i>McMahon </i>v. <i>United States, 342 </i>U. S. 25, 27 (1951), and not \'enlarge[d] ... beyond what the language requires,\'" <i>Ruckelshaus </i>v. <i>Sierra Club, 463 </i>U. S. 680, 685 (1983) (quoting <i>Eastern Transportation Co. </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/272/675/case.html">272 U. S. 675</a>, 686 (1927)), a rule of construction that we have had occasion to reaffirm once already this Term, see <i>Ardestani </i>v. <i>INS, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/502/129/case.html">502 U. S. 129</a>, 137 (1991).</p><p>Subsections (a) and (b) of \xc2\xa7 106 meet this "unequivocal expression" requirement with respect to monetary liability. Addressing "claim[s]," which the Code defines as "right[s] to payment," \xc2\xa7 101(4)(A), they plainly waive sovereign immunity with regard to monetary relief in two settings: compulsory counterclaims to governmental claims, \xc2\xa7 106(a); and permissive counterclaims to governmental claims capped by a setoff limitation, \xc2\xa7 106(b). Next to these models of clarity stands subsection (c). Though it, too, waives sovereign immunity, it fails to establish unambiguously that the waiver extends to monetary claims. I t is susceptible of at least two interpretations that do <i>not </i>authorize monetary relief.</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">35</a></p><p>Under one interpretation, \xc2\xa7 106(c) permits the bankruptcy court to issue "declaratory and injunctive"-though not monetary-relief against the Government. <i>Hoffman, </i>492 U. S., at 102. This conclusion is reached by reading the two paragraphs of subsection (c) as complementary rather than independent: The first paragraph identifies the subject matter of disputes that courts may entertain under the subsection and the second paragraph describes the relief that courts may grant in such disputes. That is to say, the second paragraph specifies the <i>manner </i>in which there shall be applied to governmental units the provisions identified by the first paragraph, i. <i>e., </i>a manner that permits declaratory or injunctive relief but not an affirmative monetary recovery.</p><p>Several factors favor this construction. The distinction it establishes-between suits for monetary claims and suits for other relief-is a familiar one, and is suggested by the contrasting language used in subsections (a) and (b) ("claim[s]") and in subsection (c) ("determination[s]" of "issue[s]"), <i>Hoffman, </i>492 U. S., at 102. It also avoids eclipsing the carefully drawn limitations placed on the waivers in subsections (a) and (b). The principal provision of the Code permitting the assertion of claims against persons other than the estate itself is \xc2\xa7 542(b), which provides that "an entity that owes a debt that is property of the estate and that is matured, payable on demand, or payable on order, shall pay such debt to, or on the order of, the trustee." If the first paragraph of \xc2\xa7 106(c) means that, by reason of use of the trigger word "entity," this provision applies <i>in all respects </i>to governmental units, then the Government may be sued on all alleged debts, despite the prior specification in subsections (a) and (b) that claims against the Government will lie only when the Government has filed a proof of claim, and even then only as a setoff unless the claim is a compulsory counterclaim. Those earlier limitations are reduced to trivial application if paragraph (c)(l) stands on its own. See <i>id., </i>at 101-102. This construction also attaches practical consequences to para-</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">36</a></p><p>graph (c)(2), whereas respondent\'s interpretation violates the settled rule that a statute must, if possible, be construed in such fashion that every word has some operative effect. See <i>id., </i>at 103; <i>United States </i>v. <i>Menasche, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/528/case.html">348 U. S. 528</a>, 538-539 (1955). Respondent has suggested no function to be performed by paragraph (2) if paragraph (1) operates to treat the Government like any other "entity" or "creditor," regardless of the type of relief authorized by an applicable Code provision.</p><p>Under this interpretation, \xc2\xa7 106(c), though not authorizing claims for monetary relief, would nevertheless perform a significant function. It would permit a bankruptcy court to determine the amount and discharge ability of an estate\'s liability to the Government, such as unpaid federal taxes, see 11 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 505(a)(1) (permitting the court to <i>"determine </i>the amount or legality of any tax") (emphasis added), whether or not the Government filed a proof of claim. See 492 U. S., at 102-103. Cf. <i>Neavear </i>v. <i>Schweiker, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/674/1201/">674 F.2d 1201</a>, 12031204 (CA7 1982) (holding that under \xc2\xa7 106(c) a bankruptcy court could discharge a debt owed to the Social Security Administration). The Government had repeatedly objected, on grounds of sovereign immunity, to being bound by such determinations before \xc2\xa7 106(c) was enacted in 1978. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>McKenzie </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/536/726/">536 F.2d 726</a>, 728-729 (CA7 <i>1976); Bostwick </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/521/741/">521 F.2d 741</a>, 742-744 (CA8 <i>1975); Gwilliam </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/519/407/">519 F.2d 407</a>, 410 (CA9 <i>1975); In re Durensky, </i>377 F. Supp. 798, 799-800 (ND Tex. 1974), appeal dism\'d, <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/519/1024/">519 F.2d 1024</a> (CA5 1975).</p><p>Subsection (c) is also susceptible of another construction that would not permit recovery here. If the two paragraphs of \xc2\xa7 106(c) are read as being independent, rather than the second as limiting the first, then, pursuant to the first paragraph, Code provisions using the triggering words enumerated in paragraph (c)(l) would apply fully to governmental units. But that application of those provisions would be limited by the requirements of subsections (a) and (b), in accord-</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">37</a></p><p>ance with the phrase that introduces subsection (c) ("Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section"). This exception, in other words, could be read to mean that the rules established in subsections (a) and (b) for waiver of Government "claim[sJ" that are "property of the estate" are exclusive, and preclude any resort to subsection (c) for that purpose. That reading would bar the present suit, since the right to recover a postpetition transfer under \xc2\xa7 550 is clearly a "claim" (defined in \xc2\xa7 101(4)(A)) and is "property of the estate" (defined in \xc2\xa7 541(a)(3)). (The dissent appears to read paragraphs (c)(l) and (c)(2) as being independent but provides no explanation of what the textual exception could mean under that reading.)</p><p>The foregoing are assuredly not the only readings of subsection (c), but they are plausible ones-which is enough to establish that a reading imposing monetary liability on the Government is not "unambiguous" and therefore should not be adopted. Contrary to respondent\'s suggestion, legislative history has no bearing on the ambiguity point. As in the Eleventh Amendment context, see <i>Hoffman, supra, </i>at 104, the "unequivocal expression" of elimination of sovereign immunity that we insist upon is an expression in statutory text. If clarity does not exist there, it cannot be supplied by a committee report. Cf. <i>Dellmuth </i>v. <i>Muth, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/491/223/case.html">491 U. S. 223</a>, 228-229 (1989).</p><p style="text-align: center;">\nIV</p><p>Respondent proposes several alternative grounds for affirming the judgment below, all unpersuasive. First, it claims that the necessary waiver can be found in 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1334(d), which grants the district court in which a bankruptcy case is initiated "exclusive jurisdiction of all of the property, wherever located, of the debtor as of the commencement of such case, and of property of the estate." Respondent urges us to construe this language as empowering a bankruptcy court to compel the United States or a State to return any property, including money, that passes into the</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">38</a></p><p>estate upon commencement of the bankruptcy proceeding. Under this theory, a sovereign\'s exposure to suit would not be governed by the specific language of \xc2\xa7 106, but would be concealed in the broad jurisdictional grant of \xc2\xa7 1334(d). Besides being unprecedented and running afoul of the unequivocal-expression requirement, this theory closely resembles an argument we rejected just last Term. In <i>Blatchford </i>v. <i>Native Village of Noatak, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/501/775/case.html">501 U. S. 775</a>, 786 (1991), the argument was made that Alaska\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity to suit was abrogated by 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 1362, a jurisdictional grant, akin to \xc2\xa7 1334(d), that gives district courts jurisdiction over "all civil actions, brought by any Indian tribe ... aris[ing] under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States." Rejecting that contention, we observed: "The fact that Congress grants <i>jurisdiction </i>to hear a claim does not suffice to show Congress has abrogated all <i>defenses </i>to that claim. The issues are wholly distinct." <i>Id., </i>at 787, n. 4.</p><p>Equally unpersuasive is respondent\'s related argument that a bankruptcy court\'s <i>in rem </i>jurisdiction overrides sovereign immunity. As an initial matter, the premise for that argument is missing here, since respondent did not invoke, and the Bankruptcy Court did not purport to exercise, <i>in </i>rem jurisdiction. Respondent sought to recover a sum of money, not "particular dollars," cf. <i>Begier </i>v. <i>IRS, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/53/case.html">496 U. S. 53</a>, 62 (1990) (emphasis deleted), so there was no <i>res </i>to which the court\'s <i>in rem </i>jurisdiction could have attached, see <i>Pennsylvania Turnpike Comm\'n </i>v. <i>McGinnes, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/268/65/">268 F.2d 65</a>, 66-67 (CA3), cert. denied, 361 U.

Because the Federal Government was the ultimate recipient of the stolen property, the Court holds that the</p><hr/><p></p>\n<p><a class="page-name">40</a></p><p>bankruptcy trustee cannot avoid the transfer. The interest in a rigid interpretation of the doctrine of sovereign immunity outweighs the interest in equitable treatment of general creditors and shareholders of the corporate debtor. This result is neither necessary nor just.</p><p>It is not necessary because both the text and the legislative history of the Bankruptcy Code support a contrary result. It is not just because nothing more than a misguided interest in adherence to obsolete judge-made rules is at stake. I shall comment first on the laws enacted by Congress and then on the rules that the Court itself has ordained.</p><p style="text-align: center;">\nI</p><p>The text of \xc2\xa7 106 is straightforward. Because the case does not involve either a counterclaim or an offset, subsections (a) and (b) are not applicable. Subsection (c) provides:</p><blockquote><p>\n"(c) Except as provided in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and notwithstanding any assertion of sovereign immunity-</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(1) a provision of this title that contains \'creditor,\' \'entity,\' or \'governmental unit\' applies to governmental units; and</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>\n"(2) a determination by the court of an issue arising under such a provision binds governmental units." 11 U.

Section 550(a) is undoubtedly one such pro-</p><p>1 Section 101(27) defines the term "governmental unit" to include the "United States [and any] department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States." 11 U.

The literal text of the Act unquestionably forecloses the defense of sovereign immunity.</p><p>The legislative history unambiguously demonstrates that Congress intended the statute to be read literally. The immediate purpose of \xc2\xa7 106(c) was to enable the bankruptcy court to determine the amount and the dischargeability of the debtor\'s tax liabilities, but the sponsors of the amendment clearly stated that it covered "other matters as well," specifically including the avoidance of preferential transfers. 124 Congo Rec. 32394 (1978) (statement of Rep. Edwards); <i>id., </i>at 33993 (statement of Sen.

The Court then explained:</p><p>"We see no reason why a different result should obtain when the IRS is the creditor.

Moreover, Congress carefully considered the effect of the new Bankruptcy Code on tax collection, see generally S. Rep. No. 95-1106 (1978) (Report of Senate Finance Committee), and decided to provide protection to tax collectors, such as the IRS, through grants of enhanced priorities for unsecured tax claims, \xc2\xa7 507(a)(6), and by the nondischarge of tax liabilities, \xc2\xa7 523(a)(1).

The Court reached this result even though the law imposed substantive obligations directly on the states, included the states in its jurisdictional grant, and included legislative discussion assuming that the states could be sued. Mter the Supreme Court changed the clear statement rule in 1985, Congress responded in 1986 with a broad textual abrogation of state immunity for statutes protecting the disabled.
