Respondent was indicted for possession of cocaine, and the trial court denied his motion to suppress the evidence as products of a warrantless search unauthorized by consent.  The Georgia Court of Appeals reversed.  In affirming, the State Supreme Court held that consent given by one occupant is not valid in the face of the refusal of another physically present occupant, and distinguished <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html">415 U. S. 164</a>, which recognized the permissibility of an entry made with the consent of one co-occupant in the other\xe2\x80\x99s absence.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>In the circumstances here at issue, a physically present co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s stated refusal to permit entry renders warrantless entry and search unreasonable and invalid as to him.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The Fourth Amendment recognizes a valid warrantless entry and search of a premises when the police obtain the voluntary consent of an occupant who shares, or is reasonably believed to share, common authority over the property, and no present co-tenant objects.  <em>Matlock, supra,</em> at 170; <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>Rodriguez,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/177/index.html">497 U. S. 177</a>, 186.  The constant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness in such cases is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations, which are influenced by property law but not controlled by its rules.  Thus, <em>Matlock </em>not only holds that a solitary co-inhabitant may sometimes consent to a search of shared premises, but also stands for the proposition that the reasonableness of such a search is in significant part a function of commonly held understandings about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each other\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  Pp.\xc2\xa04\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0<em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x99s example of common understanding is readily apparent.  The assumption tenants usually make about their common authority when they share quarters is that any one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may be admitted in his absence.  <em>Matlock </em>placed no burden on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements, absent reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0This Court took a step toward addressing the issue here when it held in <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Olson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/91/index.html">495 U. S. 91</a>, that overnight houseguests have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their temporary quarters.  If that customary expectation is a foundation of a houseguest\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights, it should follow that an inhabitant of shared premises may claim at least as much.  In fact, a co-inhabitant naturally has an even stronger claim.  No sensible person would enter shared premises based on one occupant\xe2\x80\x99s invitation when a fellow tenant said to stay out.  Such reticence would show not timidity but a realization that when people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to authority.  Absent some recognized hierarchy, <em>e.g., </em>parent and child, there is no societal or legal understanding of superior and inferior as between co-tenants.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(d)\xc2\xa0Thus, a disputed invitation, without more, gives an officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have absent any consent.  Disputed permission is no match for the Fourth Amendment central value of \xe2\x80\x9crespect for the privacy of the home,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Wilson</em> v. <em>Layne,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/526/603/index.html">526 U. S. 603</a>, 610, and the State\xe2\x80\x99s other countervailing claims do not add up to outweigh it.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A co-tenant who has an interest in bringing criminal activity to light or in deflecting suspicion from himself can, <em>e.g.,</em> tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant.  This case, which recognizes limits on evidentiary searches, has no bearing on the capacity of the police, at the invitation of one tenant, to enter a dwelling over another tenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection in order to protect a resident from domestic violence.  Though alternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside, nothing in social custom or its reflection in private law argues for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification before the government searches private living quarters over a resident\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(e)\xc2\xa0There are two loose ends.  First, while <em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for the constitutional sufficiency of a co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent to enter and search recognized a co-inhabitant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cright to permit the inspection in his own right,\xe2\x80\x9d 415 U. S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07, the right to admit the police is not a right as understood under property law.  It is, instead, the authority recognized by customary social usage as having a substantial bearing on Fourth Amendment reasonableness in specific circumstances.  The question here is whether customary social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority to prevail over the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection, a question <em>Matlock</em> did not answer.  Second, a fine line must be drawn to avoid undercutting <em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x94where the defendant, though not present, was in a squad car not far away\xe2\x80\x94and <em>Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x94</em>where the defendant was asleep in the apartment and could have been roused by a knock on the door; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not part of the threshold colloquy, loses out.  Such formalism is justified.  So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance specifically to avoid a possible objection, there is practical value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, one recognizing the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s permission when no fellow occupant is on hand, the other according dispositive weight to the fellow occupant\xe2\x80\x99s expressed contrary indication.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(f)\xc2\xa0Here, respondent\xe2\x80\x99s refusal is clear, and nothing in the record justifies the search on grounds independent of his wife\xe2\x80\x99s consent.

S. 177</a> (1990); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/164/index.html">415 U. S. 164</a> (1974).  The question here is whether such an evidentiary seizure is likewise lawful with the permission of one occupant when the other, who later seeks to suppress the evidence, is present at the scene and expressly refuses to consent.  We hold that, in the circumstances here at issue, a physically present co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s stated refusal to permit entry prevails, rendering the warrantless search unreasonable and invalid as to him.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent Scott Randolph and his wife, Janet, separated in late May 2001, when she left the marital residence in Americus, Georgia, and went to stay with her parents in Canada, taking their son and some belongings.  In July, she returned to the Americus house with the child, though the record does not reveal whether her object was reconciliation or retrieval of remaining possessions. </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On the morning of July 6, she complained to the police that after a domestic dispute her husband took their son away, and when officers reached the house she told them that her husband was a cocaine user whose habit had caused financial troubles.  She mentioned the marital problems and said that she and their son had only recently returned after a stay of several weeks with her parents.  Shortly after the police arrived, Scott Randolph returned and explained that he had removed the child to a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s house out of concern that his wife might take the boy out of the country again; he denied cocaine use, and countered that it was in fact his wife who abused drugs and alcohol.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the officers, Sergeant Murray, went with Janet Randolph to reclaim the child, and when they returned she not only renewed her complaints about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s drug use, but also volunteered that there were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98items of drug evidence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in the house.  Brief for Petitioner 3.  Sergeant Murray asked Scott Randolph for permission to search the house, which he unequivocally refused.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sergeant turned to Janet Randolph for consent to search, which she readily gave.  She led the officer upstairs to a bedroom that she identified as Scott\xe2\x80\x99s, where the sergeant noticed a section of a drinking straw with a powdery residue he suspected was cocaine.  He then left the house to get an evidence bag from his car and to call the district attorney\xe2\x80\x99s office, which instructed him to stop the search and apply for a warrant.  When Sergeant Murray returned to the house, Janet Randolph withdrew her consent.  The police took the straw to the police station, along with the Randolphs.  After getting a search warrant, they returned to the house and seized further evidence of drug use, on the basis of which Scott Randolph was indicted for possession of cocaine.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0He moved to suppress the evidence, as products of a warrantless search of his house unauthorized by his wife\xe2\x80\x99s consent over his express refusal.  The trial court denied the motion, ruling that Janet Randolph had common authority to consent to the search.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals of Georgia reversed, 264 Ga. App. 396, 590 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 834 (2003), and was itself sustained by the State Supreme Court, principally on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent to conduct a warrantless search of a residence given by one occupant is not valid in the face of the refusal of another occupant who is physically present at the scene to permit a warrantless search.\xe2\x80\x9d  278 Ga. 614, 604 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 835, 836 (2004).  The Supreme Court of Georgia acknowledged this Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <em>Matlock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/164/index.html">415 U. S. 164</a>, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 170, and found <em>Matlock </em>distinguishable just because Scott Randolph was not \xe2\x80\x9cabsent\xe2\x80\x9d from the colloquy on which the police relied for consent to make the search.  The State Supreme Court stressed that the officers in <em>Matlock</em> had not been \xe2\x80\x9cfaced with the physical presence of joint occupants, with one consenting to the search and the other objecting.\xe2\x80\x9d  278 Ga., at 615, 604 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 837.<em> </em> It held that an individual who chooses to live with another assumes a risk no greater than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an inability to control access to the premises during [his] absence,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (quoting 3 W.

S. 493</a>, 499 (1958), recognizes the validity of searches with the voluntary consent of an individual possessing authority, <em>Rodriguez,</em> 497 U. S., at 181.  That person might be the householder against whom evidence is sought, <em>Schneckloth</em> v. <em>Bustamonte,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U. S. 218</a>, 222 (1973), or a fellow occupant who shares common authority over property, when the suspect is absent, <em>Matlock,</em> <em>supra,</em> at 170, and the exception for consent extends even to entries and searches with the permission of a co-occupant whom the police reasonably, but erroneously, believe to possess shared authority as an occupant, <em>Rodriguez</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 186.  None of our co-occupant consent-to-search cases, however, has presented the further fact of a second occupant physically present and refusing permission to search, and later moving to suppress evidence so obtained.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The significance of such a refusal turns on the underpinnings of the co-occupant consent rule, as recognized since <em>Matlock</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendant in that case was arrested in the yard of a house where he lived with a Mrs. Graff and several of her relatives, and was detained in a squad car parked nearby.  When the police went to the door, Mrs. Graff admitted them and consented to a search of the house.  415 U. S., at 166.  In resolving the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objection to use of the evidence taken in the warrantless search, we said that \xe2\x80\x9cthe consent of one who possesses common authority over premises or effects is valid as against the absent, nonconsenting person with whom that authority is shared.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 170.  Consistent with our prior understanding that Fourth Amendment rights are not limited by the law of property, cf. <em>Katz</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/index.html">389 U. S. 347</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (1967), we explained that the third party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccommon authority\xe2\x80\x9d is not synonymous with a technical property interest:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe authority which justified the third-party consent does not rest upon the law of property, with its attendant historical and legal refinement, but rests rather on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right and that the others have assumed the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U. S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07 (citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">See also <em>Frazier</em> v. <em>Cupp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/index.html">394 U. S. 731</a>, 740 (1969) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]n allowing [his cousin to share use of a duffel bag] and in leaving it in his house, [the suspect] must be taken to have assumed the risk that [the cousin] would allow someone else to look inside\xe2\x80\x9d).  The common authority that counts under the Fourth Amendment may thus be broader than the rights accorded by property law, see <em>Rodriguez</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 181\xe2\x80\x93182 (consent is sufficient when given by a person who reasonably appears to have common authority but who, in fact, has no property interest in the premises searched), although its limits, too, reflect specialized tenancy arrangements apparent to the police, see <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/365/610/index.html">365 U. S. 610</a> (1961) (landlord could not consent to search of tenant\xe2\x80\x99s home).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The constant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness in the consent cases, then, is the great significance given to widely shared social expectations, which are naturally enough influenced by the law of property, but not controlled by its rules.  Cf. <em>Rakas</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/index.html">439 U. S. 128</a>, 144, n.\xc2\xa012 (1978) (an expectation of privacy is reasonable if it has \xe2\x80\x9ca source outside of the Fourth Amendment, either by reference to concepts of real or personal property law or to understandings that are recognized and permitted by society\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Matlock</em> accordingly not only holds that a solitary co-inhabitant may sometimes consent to a search of shared premises, but stands for the proposition that the reasonableness of such a search is in significant part a function of commonly held understanding about the authority that co-inhabitants may exercise in ways that affect each other\xe2\x80\x99s interests.  </p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x99s example of common understanding is readily apparent.  When someone comes to the door of a domestic dwelling with a baby at her hip, as Mrs. Graff did, she shows that she belongs there, and that fact standing alone is enough to tell a law enforcement officer or any other visitor that if she occupies the place along with others, she probably lives there subject to the assumption tenants usually make about their common authority when they share quarters.  They understand that any one of them may admit visitors, with the consequence that a guest obnoxious to one may nevertheless be admitted in his absence by another.  As <em>Matlock</em> put it, shared tenancy is understood to include an \xe2\x80\x9cassumption of risk,\xe2\x80\x9d on which police officers are entitled to rely, and although some group living together might make an exceptional arrangement that no one could admit a guest without the agreement of all, the chance of such an eccentric scheme is too remote to expect visitors to investigate a particular household\xe2\x80\x99s rules before accepting an invitation to come in.  So, <em>Matlock</em> relied on what was usual and placed no burden on the police to eliminate the possibility of atypical arrangements, in the absence of reason to doubt that the regular scheme was in place.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is also easy to imagine different facts on which, if known, no common authority could sensibly be suspected.  A person on the scene who identifies himself, say, as a landlord or a hotel manager calls up no customary understanding of authority to admit guests without the consent of the current occupant.  See <em>Chapman</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <em>supra </em>(landlord); <em>Stoner</em> v. <em>California,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/483/index.html">376 U. S. 483</a> (1964) (hotel manager).  A tenant in the ordinary course does not take rented premises subject to any formal or informal agreement that the landlord may let visitors into the dwelling, <em>Chapman</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 617, and a hotel guest customarily has no reason to expect the manager to allow anyone but his own employees into his room, see <em>Stoner</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 489; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jeffers</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/342/48/index.html">342 U. S. 48</a>, 51 (1951) (hotel staff had access to room for purposes of cleaning and maintenance, but no authority to admit police).  In these circumstances, neither state-law property rights, nor common contractual arrangements, nor any other source points to a common understanding of authority to admit third parties generally without the consent of a person occupying the premises.  And when it comes to searching through bureau drawers, there will be instances in which even a person clearly belonging on premises as an occupant may lack any perceived authority to consent; \xe2\x80\x9ca child of eight might well be considered to have the power to consent to the police crossing the threshold into that part of the house where any caller, such as a pollster or salesman, might well be admitted,\xe2\x80\x9d 4 LaFave \xc2\xa78.4(c), at 207 (4th ed. 2004), but no one would reasonably expect such a child to be in a position to authorize anyone to rummage through his parents\xe2\x80\x99 bedroom.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have not dealt directly with the reasonableness of police entry in reliance on consent by one occupant subject to immediate challenge by another, we took a step toward the issue in an earlier case dealing with the Fourth Amendment rights of a social guest arrested at premises the police entered without a warrant or the benefit of any exception to the warrant requirement.  <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Olson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/91/index.html">495 U. S. 91</a> (1990), held that overnight houseguests have a legitimate expectation of privacy in their temporary quarters because \xe2\x80\x9cit is unlikely that [the host] will admit someone who wants to see or meet with the guest over the objection of the guest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 99.  If that customary expectation of courtesy or deference is a foundation of Fourth Amendment rights of a houseguest, it presumably should follow that an inhabitant of shared premises may claim at least as much, and it turns out that the co-inhabitant naturally has an even stronger claim.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To begin with, it is fair to say that a caller standing at the door of shared premises would have no confidence that one occupant\xe2\x80\x99s invitation was a sufficiently good reason to enter when a fellow tenant stood there saying, \xe2\x80\x9cstay out.\xe2\x80\x9d  Without some very good reason, no sensible person would go inside under those conditions.  Fear for the safety of the occupant issuing the invitation, or of someone else inside, would be thought to justify entry, but the justification then would be the personal risk, the threats to life or limb, not the disputed invitation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The visitor\xe2\x80\x99s reticence without some such good reason would show not timidity but a realization that when people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation, not by appeals to authority.  Unless the people living together fall within some recognized hierarchy, like a household of parent and child or barracks housing military personnel of different grades, there is no societal understanding of superior and inferior, a fact reflected in a standard formulation of domestic property law, that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach cotenant . . . has the right to use and enjoy the entire property as if he or she were the sole owner, limited only by the same right in the other cotenants.\xe2\x80\x9d  7 R. Powell, Powell on Real Property \xc2\xa750.03[1], p.\xc2\xa050\xe2\x80\x9314 (M. Wolf gen. ed. 2005).  The want of any recognized superior authority among disagreeing tenants is also reflected in the law\xe2\x80\x99s response when the disagreements cannot be resolved.  The law does not ask who has the better side of the conflict; it simply provides a right to any co-tenant, even the most unreasonable, to obtain a decree partitioning the property (when the relationship is one of co-ownership) and terminating the relationship.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> 2 H. Tiffany, Real Property \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7468, 473, 474, pp. 297, 307\xe2\x80\x93309 (3d ed. 1939 and 2006 Cum. Supp.).  And while a decree of partition is not the answer to disagreement among rental tenants, this situation resembles co-ownership in lacking the benefit of any understanding that one or the other rental co-tenant has a superior claim to control the use of the quarters they occupy together.  In sum, there is no common understanding that one co-tenant generally has a right or authority to prevail over the express wishes of another, whether the issue is the color of the curtains or invitations to outsiders.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Since the co-tenant wishing to open the door to a third party has no recognized authority in law or social practice to prevail over a present and objecting co-tenant, his disputed invitation, without more, gives a police officer no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the absence of any consent at all.  Accordingly, in the balancing of competing individual and governmental interests entailed by the bar to unreasonable searches, <em>Camara</em> v. <em>Municipal Court of City and County of San Francisco,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/523/index.html">387 U.

(hereinafter the dissent).  It is not that the dissent exaggerates violence in the home; we recognize that domestic abuse is a serious problem in the United States.  See U. S. Dept. of Justice, National Institute of Justice, P. Tjaden &amp; N. Thoennes, Full Report of the Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequence of Violence Against Women 25\xe2\x80\x9326 (2000) (noting that over 20 million women and 6 million men will, in the course of their lifetimes, be the victims of intimate-partner abuse); U.

Chi. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 454, 507\xe2\x80\x93508 (1992) (noting that women may feel physical insecurity in their homes as a result of abuse from domestic partners).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this case has no bearing on the capacity of the police to protect domestic victims.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument rests on the failure to distinguish two different issues: when the police may enter without committing a trespass, and when the police may enter to search for evidence.  No question has been raised, or reasonably could be, about the authority of the police to enter a dwelling to protect a resident from domestic violence; so long as they have good reason to believe such a threat exists, it would be silly to suggest that the police would commit a tort by entering, say, to give a complaining tenant the opportunity to collect belongings and get out safely, or to determine whether violence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur, however much a spouse or other co-tenant objected.  (And since the police would then be lawfully in the premises, there is no question that they could seize any evidence in plain view or take further action supported by any consequent probable cause, see <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Brown,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/460/730/index.html">460 U. S. 730</a>, 737\xe2\x80\x93739 (1983) (plurality opinion).)  Thus, the question whether the police might lawfully enter over objection in order to provide any protection that might be reasonable is easily answered yes.  See 4 LaFave \xc2\xa78.3(d), at 161 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ven when . . . two persons quite clearly have equal rights in the place, as where two individuals are sharing an apartment on an equal basis, there may nonetheless sometimes exist a basis for giving greater recognition to the interests of one over the other. . . . [W]here the defendant has victimized the third-party . . . the emergency nature of the situation is such that the third-party consent should validate a warrantless search despite defendant\xe2\x80\x99s objections\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; third omission in original)).  The undoubted right of the police to enter in order to protect a victim, however, has nothing to do with the question in this case, whether a search with the consent of one co-tenant is good against another, standing at the door and expressly refusing consent.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of the cases cited by the dissent support its improbable view that recognizing limits on merely evidentiary searches would compromise the capacity to protect a fearful occupant.  In the circumstances of those cases, there is no danger that the fearful occupant will be kept behind the closed door of the house simply because the abusive tenant refuses to consent to a search.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Donlin,</em> 982 F. 2d 31, 32 (CA1 1992) (victimized individual was already outside of her apartment when police arrived and, for all intents and purposes, within the protective custody of law enforcement officers); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Hendrix,</em> 595 F. 2d 883, 885\xe2\x80\x93886 (CADC 1979) <em>(per curiam)</em> (even if the consent of the threatened co-occupant did not justify a warrantless search, the police entry was nevertheless allowable on exigent-circumstances grounds); <em>People</em> v. <em>Sanders,</em> 904 P. 2d 1311, 1313\xe2\x80\x931315 (Colo. 1995) (victimized individual gave her consent-to-search away from her home and was not present at the time of the police visit; alternatively, exigent circumstances existed to satisfy the warrantless exception); <em>Brandon</em> v. <em>State,</em> 778 P. 2d 221, 223\xe2\x80\x93224 (Alaska App. 1989) (victimized individual consented away from her home and was not present at the time of the police visit); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Davis,</em> 290 F. 3d 1239, 1241 (CA10 2002) (immediate harm extinguished after husband \xe2\x80\x9corder[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d wife out of the home).  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s red herring aside, we know, of course, that alternatives to disputed consent will not always open the door to search for evidence that the police suspect is inside.  The consenting tenant may simply not disclose enough information, or information factual enough, to add up to a showing of probable cause, and there may be no exigency to justify fast action.  But nothing in social custom or its reflection in private law argues for placing a higher value on delving into private premises to search for evidence in the face of disputed consent, than on requiring clear justification before the government searches private living quarters over a resident\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  We therefore hold that a warrantless search of a shared dwelling for evidence over the express refusal of consent by a physically present resident cannot be justified as reasonable as to him on the basis of consent given to the police by another resident.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">E</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are two loose ends, the first being the explanation given in <em>Matlock</em> for the constitutional sufficiency of a co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent to enter and search: it \xe2\x80\x9crests \xe2\x80\xa6 on mutual use of the property by persons generally having joint access or control for most purposes, so that it is reasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  415 U. S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07.  If <em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x99s co-tenant is giving permission \xe2\x80\x9cin his own right,\xe2\x80\x9d how can his \xe2\x80\x9cown right\xe2\x80\x9d be eliminated by another tenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection?  The answer appears in the very footnote from which the quoted statement is taken: the \xe2\x80\x9cright\xe2\x80\x9d to admit the police to which <em>Matlock</em> refers is not an enduring and enforceable ownership right as understood by the private law of property, but is instead the authority recognized by customary social usage as having a substantial bearing on Fourth Amendment reasonableness in specific circumstances.  Thus, to ask whether the consenting tenant has the right to admit the police when a physically present fellow tenant objects is not to question whether some property right may be divested by the mere objection of another.  It is, rather, the question whether customary social understanding accords the consenting tenant authority powerful enough to prevail over the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  The <em>Matlock</em> Court did not purport to answer this question, a point made clear by another statement (which the dissent does not quote): the Court described the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent as good against \xe2\x80\x9cthe absent, nonconsenting\xe2\x80\x9d resident.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 170.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second loose end is the significance of <em>Matlock</em> and <em>Rodriguez</em> after today\xe2\x80\x99s decision.  Although the <em>Matlock</em> defendant was not present with the opportunity to object, he was in a squad car not far away; the <em>Rodriguez</em> defendant was actually asleep in the apartment, and the police might have roused him with a knock on the door before they entered with only the consent of an apparent co-tenant.  If those cases are not to be undercut by today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, we have to admit that we are drawing a fine line; if a potential defendant with self-interest in objecting is in fact at the door and objects, the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s permission does not suffice for a reasonable search, whereas the potential objector, nearby but not invited to take part in the threshold colloquy, loses out.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This is the line we draw, and we think the formalism is justified.  So long as there is no evidence that the police have removed the potentially objecting tenant from the entrance for the sake of avoiding a possible objection, there is practical value in the simple clarity of complementary rules, one recognizing the co-tenant\xe2\x80\x99s permission when there is no fellow occupant on hand, the other according dispositive weight to the fellow occupant\xe2\x80\x99s contrary indication when he expresses it.  For the very reason that <em>Rodriguez</em> held it would be unjustifiably impractical to require the police to take affirmative steps to confirm the actual authority of a consenting individual whose authority was apparent, we think it would needlessly limit the capacity of the police to respond to ostensibly legitimate opportunities in the field if we were to hold that reasonableness required the police to take affirmative steps to find a potentially objecting co-tenant before acting on the permission they had already received.  There is no ready reason to believe that efforts to invite a refusal would make a difference in many cases, whereas every co-tenant consent case would turn into a test about the adequacy of the police\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to consult with a potential objector.  Better to accept the formalism of distinguishing <em>Matlock</em> from this case than to impose a requirement, time-consuming in the field and in the courtroom, with no apparent systemic justification.  The pragmatic decision to accept the simplicity of this line is, moreover, supported by the substantial number of instances in which suspects who are asked for permission to search actually consent,[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] albeit imprudently, a fact that undercuts any argument that the police should try to locate a suspected inhabitant because his denial of consent would be a foregone conclusion.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case invites a straightforward application of the rule that a physically present inhabitant\xe2\x80\x99s express refusal of consent to a police search is dispositive as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.  Scott Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s refusal is clear, and nothing in the record justifies the search on grounds independent of Janet Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  The State does not argue that she gave any indication to the police of a need for protection inside the house that might have justified entry into the portion of the premises where the police found the powdery straw (which, if lawfully seized, could have been used when attempting to establish probable cause for the warrant issued later).  Nor does the State claim that the entry and search should be upheld under the rubric of exigent circumstances, owing to some apprehension by the police officers that Scott Randolph would destroy evidence of drug use before any warrant could be obtained.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia is therefore affirmed. </p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Alito took no part in the consideration or decision of this case.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0All four Courts of Appeals to have considered this question have concluded that consent remains effective in the face of an express objection.

That is because, as The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s dissent points out, a rule permitting such searches can serve important law enforcement needs (for example, in domestic abuse cases) and the consenting party\xe2\x80\x99s joint tenancy diminishes the objecting party\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Fourth Amendment does not insist upon bright-line rules.  Rather, it recognizes that no single set of legal rules can capture the ever changing complexity of human life.  It consequently uses the general terms \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  And this Court has continuously emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[r]easonableness \xe2\x80\xa6 is measured \xe2\x80\xa6 by examining the totality of the circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ohio</em> v. <em>Robinette,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/519/33/index.html">519 U.

The objecting party was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the house.  The officers did not justify their search on grounds of possible evidence destruction.  Cf. <em>Thornton</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/615/index.html">541 U. S. 615</a>, 620\xe2\x80\x93622 (2004);<em> Skinner</em> v. <em>Railway Labor Executives\xe2\x80\x99 Assn.,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/602/index.html">489 U.

And, as far as the record reveals, the officers might easily have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter.  See <em>Illinois</em> v. <em>McArthur, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/531/326/index.html">531 U. S. 326</a> (2001).  Thus, the \xe2\x80\x9ctotality of the circumstances\xe2\x80\x9d present here do not suffice to justify abandoning the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s traditional hostility to police entry into a home without a warrant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I stress the totality of the circumstances, however, because, were the circumstances to change significantly, so should the result.

Consider,\nfor example, instances of domestic abuse. See <em>ante</em>, at\n13.  \xe2\x80\x9cFamily disturbance calls . . . constitute the largest single category of calls received by police departments each year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mederer &amp; Gelles, Compassion or Control: Intervention in Cases of Wife Abuse, 4 Journal of\nInterpersonal Violence 25 (Mar. 1989) (emphasis deleted); see also, <em>e.g.,</em> Office of the Attorney General, California Criminal Justice Statistics Center, Domestic Violence Related Calls for Assistance, 1987\xe2\x80\x932003, County\nby Year, http://ag.ca.gov/cjsc/publications/misc/dvsr/tabs/\n8703.pdf (as visited Mar. 1, 2006, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file) (providing data showing that California police received an average of 207,848 domestic violence related calls each year); Cessato, Defenders Against Domestic Abuse, Washington Post, Aug. 25, 2002, p.\xc2\xa0B8 (\xe2\x80\x9cIn the District [of Columbia], police report that almost half of roughly 39,000 violent crime calls received in 2000 involved domestic violence\xe2\x80\x9d); Zorza, Women Battering: High Costs and the State of the Law, Clearinghouse Review, p.\xc2\xa0385 (Special Issue 1994) (\xe2\x80\x9cOne-third of all police time is spent responding to domestic disturbance calls\xe2\x80\x9d).

It could also indicate the availability of evidence, in the form of an immediate willingness to speak, that might not otherwise exist.  In that context, an invitation (or consent) would provide a special reason for immediate, rather than later, police entry.  And, entry following invitation or consent by one party ordinarily would be reasonable even in the face of direct objection by the other.  That being so, contrary to the The Chief Justice\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, <em>post</em>,<em> </em>at 13, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will not adversely affect ordinary law enforcement practices.</f></f></p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the case-specific nature of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding, and with these understandings, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding and its opinion.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962035">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nSTEVENS, J., CONCURRING<br/>\nGEORGIA V.

In both situations the facts uncovered by the study are usually relevant but not necessarily dispositive.  This case illustrates why even the most dedicated adherent to an approach to constitutional interpretation that places primary reliance on the search for original understanding would recognize the relevance of changes in our society.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At least since 1604 it has been settled that in the absence of exigent circumstances, a government agent has no right to enter a \xe2\x80\x9chouse\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccastle\xe2\x80\x9d unless authorized to do so by a valid warrant.  See <em>Semayne\xe2\x80\x99s Case</em>, 5 Co. Rep. 91a, 77 Eng. Rep. 194 (K.B.).  Every occupant of the home has a right\xe2\x80\x94protected by the common law for centuries and by the Fourth Amendment since 1791\xe2\x80\x94to refuse entry.  When an occupant gives his or her consent to enter, he or she is waiving a valuable constitutional right.  To be sure that the waiver is voluntary, it is sound practice\xe2\x80\x94a practice some Justices of this Court thought necessary to make the waiver voluntary[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]\xe2\x80\x94for the officer to advise the occupant of that right.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The issue in this case relates to the content of the advice that the officer should provide when met at the door by a man and a woman who are apparently joint tenants or joint owners of the property.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the 18th century, when the Fourth Amendment was adopted, the advice would have been quite different from what is appropriate today.  Given the then-prevailing dramatic differences between the property rights of the husband and the far lesser rights of the wife, only the consent of the husband would matter.  Whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe master of the house\xe2\x80\x9d consented or objected, his decision would control.  Thus if \xe2\x80\x9coriginal understanding\xe2\x80\x9d were to govern the outcome of this case, the search was clearly invalid because the husband did not consent.  History, however, is not dispositive because it is now clear, as a matter of constitutional law, that the male and the female are equal partners.  <em>Reed </em>v. <em>Reed</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/71/index.html">404 U. S. 71</a> (1971).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In today\xe2\x80\x99s world the only advice that an officer could properly give should make it clear that each of the partners has a constitutional right that he or she may independently assert or waive.  Assuming that both spouses are competent, neither one is a master possessing the power to override the other\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to deny entry to their castle.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these observations, I join the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Schneckloth</em> v. <em>Bustamonte,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U.

S. 436</a>, 477\xe2\x80\x93478 (1966).  Consistent with this principle, the Court held in <em>Coolidge</em> v. <em>New Hampshire</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/443/index.html">403 U. S. 443</a> (1971), that no Fourth Amendment search occurs where, as here, the spouse of an accused voluntarily leads the police to potential evidence of wrongdoing by the accused.  <em>Id</em>., at 486\xe2\x80\x93490.  Because <em>Coolidge </em>squarely controls this case, the Court need not address whether police could permissibly have conducted a general search of the Randolph home, based on Mrs. Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s consent.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the instant case, Mrs. Randolph told police responding to a domestic dispute that respondent was using a substantial quantity of cocaine.  Upon police request, she consented to a general search of her residence to investigate her statements.  However, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the facts demonstrates, <em>ante, </em>at 2, the record is clear that no such general search occurred.  Instead, Sergeant Brett Murray asked Mrs. Randolph where the cocaine was located, and she showed him to an upstairs bedroom, where he saw the \xe2\x80\x9cpiece of cut straw\xe2\x80\x9d on a dresser.  Corrected Tr. of Motion to Suppression Hearing in Case No. 2001R\xe2\x80\x93699 (Super. Ct. Sumter Cty., Ga., Oct. 3, 2002), pp. 8\xe2\x80\x939.  Upon closer examination, Sergeant Murray observed white residue on the straw, and concluded the straw had been used for ingesting cocaine.  <em>Id.</em>, at 8.  He then collected the straw and the residue as evidence.  <em>Id</em>., at 9.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Sergeant Murray\xe2\x80\x99s entry into the Randolphs\xe2\x80\x99 home at the invitation of Mrs. Randolph to be shown evidence of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s cocaine use does not constitute a Fourth Amendment search.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents, only the action of an agent of the government can constitute a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, because that Amendment \xe2\x80\x9cwas intended as a restraint upon the activities of <em>sovereign authority</em>, and was not intended to be a limitation upon other than governmental agencies.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Burdeau</em> v. <em>McDowell</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/256/465/index.html">256 U. S. 465</a>, 475 (1921) (emphasis added).  See also <em>Coolidge</em>, 403 U. S., at 487.  Applying this principle in <em>Coolidge</em>, the Court held that when a citizen leads police officers into a home shared with her spouse to show them evidence relevant to their investigation into a crime, that citizen is not acting as an agent of the police, and thus no Fourth Amendment search has occurred.  <em>Id.</em>, at 488\xe2\x80\x93498.</p>\n<p>\n<em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</em>Review of the facts in <em>Coolidge </em>clearly demonstrates that it governs this case.  While the police interrogated Coolidge as part of their investigation into a murder, two other officers were sent to his house to speak with his wife.  <em>Id.,</em> at 485.  During the course of questioning Mrs. Coolidge, the police asked whether her husband owned any guns.  <em>Id</em>., at 486.  Mrs. Coolidge replied in the affirmative, and offered to retrieve the weapons for the police, apparently operating under the assumption that doing so would help to exonerate her husband.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The police accompanied Mrs. Coolidge to the bedroom to collect the guns, as well as clothing that Mrs. Coolidge told them her husband had been wearing the night of the murder.  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Before this Court, Coolidge argued that the evidence of the guns and clothing should be suppressed as the product of an unlawful search because Mrs. Coolidge was acting as an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98instrument,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or agent, of the police by complying with a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98demand\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d made by them.  <em>Id</em>., at 487.  The Court recognized that, had Mrs. Coolidge sought out the guns to give to police wholly on her own initiative, \xe2\x80\x9cthere can be no doubt under existing law that the articles would later have been admissible in evidence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  That she did so in cooperation with police pursuant to their request did not transform her into their agent; after all, \xe2\x80\x9cit is no part of the policy underlying the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to discourage citizens from aiding to the utmost of their ability in the apprehension of criminals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 488.  Because the police were \xe2\x80\x9cacting normally and properly\xe2\x80\x9d when they asked about any guns, and questioning Mrs. Coolidge about the clothing was \xe2\x80\x9clogical and in no way coercive,\xe2\x80\x9d the Fourth Amendment did not require police to \xe2\x80\x9cavert their eyes\xe2\x80\x9d when Mrs. Coolidge produced the guns and clothes for inspection.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Id</em>., at 488\xe2\x80\x93489.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This case is indistinguishable from <em>Coolidge</em>, compelling the conclusion that Mrs. Randolph was not acting as an agent of the police when she admitted Sergeant Murray into her home and led him to the incriminating evidence.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Just as Mrs. Coolidge could, of her own accord, have offered her husband\xe2\x80\x99s weapons and clothing to the police without implicating the Fourth Amendment, so too could Mrs. Randolph have simply retrieved the straw from the house and given it to Sergeant Murray.  Indeed, the majority appears to concede as much.  <em>Ante,</em> at 11-12 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe co-tenant acting on his own initiative may be able to deliver evidence to the police, <em>Coolidge</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 487\xe2\x80\x93489\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0, and can tell the police what he knows, for use before a magistrate in getting a warrant\xe2\x80\x9d).  Drawing a constitutionally significant distinction between what occurred here and Mrs. Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s independent production of the relevant evidence is both inconsistent with <em>Coolidge </em>and unduly formalistic.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, the trial court appropriately denied respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion to suppress the evidence Mrs. Randolph provided to the police and the evidence obtained as a result of the consequent search warrant.  I would therefore reverse the judgment of the Supreme Court of Georgia.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although the Court has described <em>Coolidge</em> as a \xe2\x80\x9cthird-party consent\xe2\x80\x9d case, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html">415 U.

Nor is it clear to me that the answers to these questions depended solely on who owned the house.  It is entirely clear, however, that <em>if</em> the matter <em>did</em> depend solely on property rights, a latter-day alteration of property rights would also produce a latter-day alteration of the Fourth Amendment outcome\xe2\x80\x94without altering the Fourth Amendment itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 attempted critique of originalism confuses the original import of the Fourth Amendment with the background sources of law to which the Amendment, on its original meaning, referred.  From the date of its ratification until well into the 20th century, violation of the Amendment was tied to common-law trespass.  See <em>Kyllo</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/27/index.html">533 U. S. 27</a>, 31\xe2\x80\x9332 (2001); see also <em>California</em> v. <em>Acevedo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/565/index.html">500 U. S. 565</a>, 581, 583 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  On the basis of that connection, someone who had power to license the search of a house by a private party could authorize a police search.  See 1 Restatement of Torts \xc2\xa7167, and Comment <em>b</em> (1934); see also <em>Williams</em> v. <em>Howard</em>, 110 S.\xc2\xa0C. 82, 96 S.\xc2\xa0E. 251 (1918); <em>Fennemore</em> v. <em>Armstrong</em>, 29 Del. 35, 96 A. 204 (Super. Ct. 1915).  The issue of <em>who</em> could give such consent generally depended, in turn, on \xe2\x80\x9chistorical and legal refinements\xe2\x80\x9d of property law.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html">415 U. S. 164</a>, 171, n.\xc2\xa07 (1974).  As property law developed, individuals who previously could not authorize a search might become able to do so, and those who once could grant such consent might no longer have that power.  But changes in the law of property to which the Fourth Amendment referred would not alter the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s meaning: that anyone capable of authorizing a search by a private party could consent to a warrantless search by the police.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is nothing new or surprising in the proposition that our unchanging Constitution refers to other bodies of law that might themselves change.  The Fifth Amendment provides, for instance, that \xe2\x80\x9cprivate property\xe2\x80\x9d shall not \xe2\x80\x9cbe taken for public use, without just compensation\xe2\x80\x9d; but it does not purport to define property rights.  We have consistently held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe existence of a property interest is determined by reference to \xe2\x80\x98existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Phillips</em> v. <em>Washington Legal Foundation, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/524/156/index.html">524 U. S. 156</a>, 164 (1998) (quoting <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges</em> v. <em>Roth,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/index.html">408 U. S. 564</a>, 577 (1972)).  The same is true of the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause\xe2\x80\x99s protection of \xe2\x80\x9cproperty.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Castle Rock</em> v.<em> Gonzales, </em>545 U. S. ___, ___ (2005).  This reference to changeable law presents no problem for the originalist.  No one supposes that the <em>meaning </em>of the Constitution changes as States expand and contract property rights.  If it is indeed true, therefore, that a wife in 1791 could not authorize the search of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s house, the fact that current property law provides otherwise is no more troublesome for the originalist than the well established fact that a State must compensate its takings of even those property rights that did not exist at the time of the Founding.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In any event, Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 panegyric to the <em>equal</em> rights of women under modern property law does not support his conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ssuming \xe2\x80\xa6 both spouses are competent, neither one is a master possessing the power to override the other\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional right to deny entry to their castle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  The issue at hand is what to do when there is a <em>conflict</em> between two equals.  Now that women have authority to consent, as Justice Stevens claims men alone once did, it does not follow that the spouse who <em>refuses</em> consent should be the winner of the contest.  Justice Stevens could just as well have followed the same historical developments to the opposite conclusion: Now that \xe2\x80\x9cthe male and the female are equal partners,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 2, and women can consent to a search of their property, men can no longer obstruct their wishes.  Men and women are no more \xe2\x80\x9cequal\xe2\x80\x9d in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s regime, where both sexes can veto each other\xe2\x80\x99s consent, than on the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s view, where both sexes cannot.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, I must express grave doubt that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision deserves Justice Stevens\xe2\x80\x99 celebration as part of the forward march of women\xe2\x80\x99s equality.  Given the usual patterns of domestic violence, how often can police be expected to encounter the situation in which a man urges them to enter the home while a woman simultaneously demands that they stay out?  The most common practical effect of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, insofar as the contest between the sexes is concerned, is to give men the power to stop women from allowing police into their homes\xe2\x80\x94which is, curiously enough, <em>precisely</em> the power that Justice Stevens disapprovingly presumes men had in 1791.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962038">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nROBERTS, C. J., DISSENTING<br/>\nGEORGIA V. RANDOLPH<br/>\n547 U. S. ____ (2006)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\nNO. 04-1067<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">GEORGIA, PETITIONER <em>v.</em> SCOTT FITZ RANDOLPH</p>\n<p align="left">on writ of certiorari to the supreme court of\ngeorgia</p>\n<p align="left">[March 22, 2006]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Chief Justice Roberts, with whom Justice Scalia joins, dissenting.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court creates constitutional law by surmising what is typical when a social guest encounters an entirely atypical situation.  The rule the majority fashions does not implement the high office of the Fourth Amendment to protect privacy, but instead provides protection on a random and happenstance basis, protecting, for example, a co-occupant who happens to be at the front door when the other occupant consents to a search, but not one napping or watching television in the next room.  And the cost of affording such random protection is great, as demonstrated by the recurring cases in which abused spouses seek to authorize police entry into a home they share with a nonconsenting abuser.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The correct approach to the question presented is clearly mapped out in our precedents: The Fourth Amendment protects privacy.  If an individual shares information, papers, <em>or places </em>with another, he assumes the risk that the other person will in turn share access to that information or those papers <em>or places</em> with the government.  And just as an individual who has shared illegal plans or incriminating documents with another cannot interpose an objection when that other person turns the information over to the government, just because the individual happens to be present at the time, so too someone who shares a place with another cannot interpose an objection when that person decides to grant access to the police, simply because the objecting individual happens to be present.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A warrantless search is reasonable if police obtain the voluntary consent of a person authorized to give it.  Co-occupants have \xe2\x80\x9cassumed the risk that one of their number might permit [a] common area to be searched.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/164/index.html">415 U. S. 164</a>, 171, n.\xc2\xa07 (1974).  Just as Mrs. Randolph could walk upstairs, come down, and turn her husband\xe2\x80\x99s cocaine straw over to the police, she can consent to police entry and search of what is, after all, her home, too.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Illinois </em>v. <em>Rodriguez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/497/177/index.html">497 U. S. 177</a> (1990), this Court stated that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat [a person] is assured by the Fourth Amendment \xe2\x80\xa6 is not that no government search of his house will occur unless he consents; but that no such search will occur that is \xe2\x80\x98unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 183.  One element that can make a warrantless government search of a home \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98reasonable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d is voluntary consent.  <em>Id.</em>, at 184; <em>Schneckloth</em> v. <em>Bustamonte,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/412/218/index.html">412 U. S. 218</a>, 219 (1973).  Proof of voluntary consent \xe2\x80\x9cis not limited to proof that consent was given by the defendant,\xe2\x80\x9d but the government \xe2\x80\x9cmay show that permission to search was obtained from a third party who possessed common authority over or other sufficient relationship to the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matlock</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 171.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion creates an exception to this otherwise clear rule: A third-party consent search is unreasonable, and therefore constitutionally impermissible, if the co-occupant against whom evidence is obtained was present and objected to the entry and search.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This exception is based on what the majority describes as \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cwhen people living together disagree over the use of their common quarters, a resolution must come through voluntary accommodation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 9.  But this fundamental predicate to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis gets us nowhere: Does the objecting cotenant accede to the consenting cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s wishes, or the other way around?  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s assumption about voluntary accommodation simply leads to the common stalemate of two gentlemen insisting that the other enter a room first.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nevertheless, the majority is confident in assuming\xe2\x80\x94confident enough to incorporate its assumption into the Constitution\xe2\x80\x94that an invited social guest who arrives at the door of a shared residence, and is greeted by a disagreeable co-occupant shouting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98stay out,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d would simply go away.  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  The Court observes that \xe2\x80\x9cno sensible person would go inside under those conditions,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and concludes from this that the inviting co-occupant has no \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d to insist on getting her way over the wishes of her co-occupant, <em>ante</em>, at 10.  But it seems equally accurate to say\xe2\x80\x94based on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that one does not have a right to prevail over the express wishes of his co-occupant\xe2\x80\x94that the objector has no \xe2\x80\x9cauthority\xe2\x80\x9d to insist on getting <em>his</em> way over his co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s wish that her guest be admitted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact is that a wide variety of differing social situations can readily be imagined, giving rise to quite different social expectations.  A relative or good friend of one of two feuding roommates might well enter the apartment over the objection of the other roommate.  The reason the invitee appeared at the door also affects expectations: A guest who came to celebrate an occupant\xe2\x80\x99s birthday, or one who had traveled some distance for a particular reason, might not readily turn away simply because of a roommate\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  The nature of the place itself is also pertinent: Invitees may react one way if the feuding roommates share one room, differently if there are common areas from which the objecting roommate could readily be expected to absent himself.  Altering the numbers might well change the social expectations: Invitees might enter if two of three co-occupants encourage them to do so, over one dissenter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The possible scenarios are limitless, and slight variations in the fact pattern yield vastly different expectations about whether the invitee might be expected to enter or to go away.  Such shifting expectations are not a promising foundation on which to ground a constitutional rule, particularly because the majority has no support for its basic assumption\xe2\x80\x94that an invited guest encountering two disagreeing co-occupants would flee\xe2\x80\x94beyond a hunch about how people would typically act in an atypical situation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in fact the Court has not looked to such expectations to decide questions of consent under the Fourth Amendment, but only to determine when a search has occurred and whether a particular person has standing to object to a search.  For these latter inquiries, we ask whether a person has a subjective expectation of privacy in a particular place, and whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe expectation [is] one that society is prepared to recognize as \xe2\x80\x98reasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Katz</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/389/347/index.html">389 U. S. 347</a>, 361 (1967) (Harlan, J., concurring); see <em>Minnesota</em> v. <em>Olson,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/91/index.html">495 U. S. 91</a>, 95\xe2\x80\x9396, 100 (1990) (extending <em>Katz </em>test to standing inquiry).  But the social expectations concept has not been applied to all questions arising under the Fourth Amendment, least of all issues of consent.  A criminal might have a strong expectation that his longtime confidant will not allow the government to listen to their private conversations, but however profound his shock might be upon betrayal, government monitoring with the confidant\xe2\x80\x99s consent is reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.  See <em>United States </em>v. <em>White</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/745/index.html">401 U. S. 745</a>, 752 (1971).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that \xe2\x80\x9cwidely shared social expectations\xe2\x80\x9d are a \xe2\x80\x9cconstant element in assessing Fourth Amendment reasonableness,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6 (citing <em>Rakas</em> v. <em>Illinois,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/439/128/index.html">439 U. S. 128</a>, 144, n.\xc2\xa012 (1978)), but that is not the case; the Fourth Amendment precedents the majority cites refer instead to a \xe2\x80\x9clegitimate expectation of <em>privacy</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added; internal quotation marks omitted).  Whatever social expectation the majority seeks to protect, it is not one of privacy.  The very predicate giving rise to the question in cases of shared information, papers, containers, or places is that privacy has been shared with another.  Our common social expectations may well be that the other person will not, in turn, share what we have shared with them with another\xe2\x80\x94including the police\xe2\x80\x94but that is the risk we take in sharing.  If two friends share a locker and one keeps contraband inside, he might trust that his friend will not let others look inside.  But by sharing private space, privacy has \xe2\x80\x9calready been frustrated\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to the lockermate.  <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/109/index.html">466 U. S. 109</a>, 117 (1984).  If two roommates share a computer and one keeps pirated software on a shared drive, he might assume that his roommate will not inform the government.  But that person has given up his privacy with respect to his roommate by saving the software on their shared computer.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A wide variety of often subtle social conventions may shape expectations about how we act when another shares with us what is otherwise private, and those conventions go by a variety of labels\xe2\x80\x94courtesy, good manners, custom, protocol, even honor among thieves.  The Constitution, however, protects not these but privacy, and once privacy has been shared, the shared information, documents, or places remain private only at the discretion of the confidant.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases reflect this understanding.  In <em>United States </em>v. <em>White</em>, we held that one party to a conversation can consent to government eavesdropping, and statements made by the other party will be admissible at trial.  401 U. S., at 752.  This rule is based on privacy: \xe2\x80\x9cInescapably, one contemplating illegal activities must realize and risk that his companions may be reporting to the police\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. [I]f he has no doubts, or allays them, or risks what doubt he has, the risk is his.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court has applied this same analysis to objects and places as well.  In Frazier</em> v. <em>Cupp,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/731/index.html">394 U. S. 731</a> (1969), a duffel bag \xe2\x80\x9cwas being used jointly\xe2\x80\x9d by two cousins.  <em>Id.</em>, at 740.  The Court held that the consent of one was effective to result in the seizure of evidence used against both: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]n allowing [his cousin] to use the bag and in leaving it in his house, [the defendant] must be taken to have assumed the risk that [his cousin] would allow someone else to look inside.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court explained in <em>United States </em>v. <em>Jacobsen</em>, <em>supra:</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well settled that when an individual reveals private information to another, he assumes the risk that his confidant will reveal that information to the authorities, and if that occurs the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit governmental use of that information.  Once frustration of the original expectation of privacy occurs, the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit governmental use of the now nonprivate information: \xe2\x80\x98This Court has held repeatedly that the Fourth Amendment does not prohibit the obtaining of information revealed to a third party and conveyed by him to Government authorities, even if the information is revealed on the assumption that it will be used only for a limited purpose and the confidence placed in a third party will not be betrayed.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id.</em>, at 117 (quoting <em>United States</em> v. <em>Miller,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/425/435/index.html">425 U. S. 435</a>, 443 (1976)).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The same analysis applies to the question whether our privacy can be compromised by those with whom we share common living space.  If a person keeps contraband in common areas of his home, he runs the risk that his co-occupants will deliver the contraband to the police.  In <em>Coolidge</em> v. <em>New Hampshire,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/403/443/index.html">403 U. S. 443</a> (1971), Mrs. Coolidge retrieved four of her husband\xe2\x80\x99s guns and the clothes he was wearing the previous night and handed them over to police.  We held that these items were properly admitted at trial because \xe2\x80\x9cwhen Mrs. Coolidge of her own accord produced the guns and clothes for inspection, \xe2\x80\xa6 it was not incumbent on the police to stop her or avert their eyes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 489.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even in our most private relationships, our observable actions and possessions are private at the discretion of those around us.  A husband can request that his wife not tell a jury about contraband that she observed in their home or illegal activity to which she bore witness, but it is she who decides whether to invoke the testimonial marital privilege.  <em>Trammel</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/445/40/index.html">445 U. S. 40</a>, 53 (1980).  In <em>Trammel</em>, we noted that the former rule prohibiting a wife from testifying about her husband\xe2\x80\x99s observable wrongdoing at his say so \xe2\x80\x9cgoes far beyond making \xe2\x80\x98every man\xe2\x80\x99s house his castle,\xe2\x80\x99 and permits a person to convert his house into \xe2\x80\x98a den of thieves.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 51\xe2\x80\x9352 (quoting 5 J.\xc2\xa0Bentham, Rationale of Judicial Evidence 340 (1827)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no basis for evaluating physical searches of shared space in a manner different from how we evaluated the privacy interests in the foregoing cases, and in fact the Court has proceeded along the same lines in considering such searches.  In <em>Matlock</em>, police arrested the defendant in the front yard of a house and placed him in a squad car, and then obtained permission from Mrs. Graff to search a shared bedroom for evidence of Matlock\xe2\x80\x99s bank robbery.  415 U. S., at 166.  Police certainly could have assumed that Matlock would have objected were he consulted as he sat handcuffed in the squad car outside.  And in <em>Rodriguez</em>, where Miss Fischer offered to facilitate the arrest of her sleeping boyfriend by admitting police into an apartment she apparently shared with him, 497 U. S., at 179, police might have noted that this entry was undoubtedly contrary to Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s social expectations.  Yet both of these searches were reasonable under the Fourth Amendment because Mrs. Graff had authority, and Miss Fischer apparent authority, to admit others into areas over which they exercised control, despite the almost certain wishes of their <em>present</em> co-occupants.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The common thread in our decisions upholding searches conducted pursuant to third-party consent is an understanding that a person \xe2\x80\x9cassume[s] the risk\xe2\x80\x9d that those who have access to and control over his shared property might consent to a search.  <em>Matlock</em>,<em> </em>415 U. S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07.  In <em>Matlock</em>, we explained that this assumption of risk is derived from a third party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjoint access or control for most purposes\xe2\x80\x9d of shared property.  <em>Ibid.</em>  And we concluded that shared use of property makes it \xe2\x80\x9creasonable to recognize that any of the co-inhabitants has the right to permit the inspection in his own right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this sense, the risk assumed by a joint occupant is comparable to the risk assumed by one who reveals private information to another.  If a person has incriminating information, he can keep it private in the face of a request from police to share it, because he has that right under the Fifth Amendment.  If a person occupies a house with incriminating information in it, he can keep that information private in the face of a request from police to search the house, because he has that right under the Fourth Amendment.

Mr. Randolph acknowledged this distinction in his motion to suppress, where he differentiated his law office from the rest of the Randolph house by describing it as an area that \xe2\x80\x9cwas solely in his control and dominion.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 3.  As to a \xe2\x80\x9ccommon area,\xe2\x80\x9d however, co-occupants with \xe2\x80\x9cjoint access or control\xe2\x80\x9d may consent to an entry and search.  <em>Matlock</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 171, n.\xc2\xa07.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By emphasizing the objector\xe2\x80\x99s presence and noting an occupant\xe2\x80\x99s understanding that obnoxious guests might \xe2\x80\x9cbe admitted in [one\xe2\x80\x99s] absence,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 7, the majority appears to resurrect an agency theory of consent suggested in our early cases.  See <em>Stoner </em>v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/376/483/index.html">376 U. S. 483</a>, 489 (1964) (stating that a hotel clerk could not consent to a search of a guest\xe2\x80\x99s room because the guest had not waived his rights \xe2\x80\x9cby word or deed, either directly or through an agent\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Chapman </em>v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/365/610/index.html">365 U.

This agency theory is belied by the facts of <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez</em>\xe2\x80\x94both defendants were present but simply not asked for consent\xe2\x80\x94and the Court made clear in those cases that a co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s authority to consent rested not on an absent occupant\xe2\x80\x99s delegation of choice to an agent, but on the consenting co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cjoint access or control\xe2\x80\x9d of the property.  <em>Matlock</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 171, n.\xc2\xa07; see <em>Rodriguez</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 181; <em>United States </em>v. <em>McAlpine</em>, 919 F.\xc2\xa02d 1461, 1464, n.\xc2\xa02 (CA10 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]gency analysis [was] put to rest by the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning in <em>Matlock</em>\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The law acknowledges that although we might not expect our friends and family to admit the government into common areas, sharing space entails risk.  A person assumes the risk that his co-occupants\xe2\x80\x94just as they might report his illegal activity or deliver his contraband to the government\xe2\x80\x94might consent to a search of areas over which they have access and control.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Karo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/705/index.html">468 U. S. 705</a>, 726 (1984) (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (finding it a \xe2\x80\x9crelatively easy case \xe2\x80\xa6 when two persons share identical, overlapping privacy interests in a particular place, container, or conversation.

That interest is not protected if a co-owner happens to be absent when the police arrive, in the backyard gardening, asleep in the next room, or listening to music through earphones so that only his co-occupant hears the knock on the door.  That the rule is so random in its application confirms that it bears no real relation to the privacy protected by the Fourth Amendment.  What the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule protects is not so much privacy as the good luck of a co-owner who just happens to be present at the door when the police arrive.  Usually when the development of Fourth Amendment jurisprudence leads to such arbitrary lines, we take it as a signal that the rules need to be rethought.  See <em>California</em> v. <em>Acevedo,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/500/565/index.html">500 U. S. 565</a>, 574, 580 (1991).  We should not embrace a rule at the outset that its <em>sponsors </em>appreciate will result in drawing fine, formalistic lines.  See <em>ante</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than draw such random and happenstance lines\xe2\x80\x94and pretend that the Constitution decreed them\xe2\x80\x94the more reasonable approach is to adopt a rule acknowledging that shared living space entails a limited yielding of privacy to others, and that the law historically permits those to whom we have yielded our privacy to in turn cooperate with the government.  Such a rule flows more naturally from our cases concerning Fourth Amendment reasonableness and is logically grounded in the concept of privacy underlying that Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The scope of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule is not only arbitrary but obscure as well.  The majority repeats several times that a present co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to permit entry renders the search unreasonable and invalid \xe2\x80\x9cas to him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1, 15\xe2\x80\x9316, 18.  This implies entry and search would be reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cas to\xe2\x80\x9d someone else, presumably the consenting co-occupant and any other absent co-occupants.  The normal Fourth Amendment rule is that items discovered in plain view are admissible if the officers were legitimately on the premises; if the entry and search were reasonable \xe2\x80\x9cas to\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Randolph, based on her consent, it is not clear why the cocaine straw should not be admissible \xe2\x80\x9cas to\xe2\x80\x9d Mr. Randolph, as discovered in plain view during a legitimate search \xe2\x80\x9cas to\xe2\x80\x9d Mrs. Randolph.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s differentiation between entry focused on discovering whether domestic violence has occurred (and the consequent authority to seize items in plain view), and entry focused on searching for evidence of other crime, is equally puzzling.  See <em>ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  This Court has rejected subjective motivations of police officers in assessing Fourth Amendment questions, see<em> Whren</em> v. <em>United States,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/517/806/index.html">517 U. S. 806</a>, 812\xe2\x80\x93813 (1996), with good reason: The police do not need a particular reason to ask for consent to search, whether for signs of domestic violence or evidence of drug possession.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule protects something random, its consequences are particularly severe.  The question presented often arises when innocent cotenants seek to disassociate or protect themselves from ongoing criminal activity.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Hendrix</em>, 595 F.\xc2\xa02d 883, 884 (CADC 1979) (wife asked police \xe2\x80\x9cto get her baby and take [a] sawed-off shotgun out of her house\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>People </em>v. <em>Cosme</em>, 48 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 2d 286, 288\xe2\x80\x93289, 293, 397 N.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 1319, 1320, 1323 (1979) (woman asked police to remove cocaine and a gun from a shared closet); <em>United States </em>v. <em>Botsch</em>, 364 F.\xc2\xa02d 542, 547 (CA2 1966).  Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, there will be many cases in which a consenting co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s wish to have the police enter is overridden by an objection from another present co-occupant.  What does the majority imagine will happen, in a case in which the consenting co-occupant is concerned about the other\xe2\x80\x99s criminal activity, once the door clicks shut?  The objecting co-occupant may pause briefly to decide whether to destroy any evidence of wrongdoing or to inflict retribution on the consenting co-occupant first, but there can be little doubt that he will attend to both in short order.  It is no answer to say that the consenting co-occupant can depart with the police; remember that it is her home, too, and the other co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s very presence, which allowed him to object, may also prevent the consenting co-occupant from doing more than urging the police to enter.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps the most serious consequence of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule is its operation in domestic abuse situations, a context in which the present question often arises.  See <em>Rodriguez</em>, 497 U. S., at 179; <em>United States </em>v. <em>Donlin</em>, 982 F.\xc2\xa02d 31 (CA1 1992); <em>Hendrix</em>, <em>supra; People </em>v. <em>Sanders</em>, 904 P.\xc2\xa02d 1311 (Colo. 1995) (en banc); <em>Brandon </em>v. <em>State</em>, 778 P.\xc2\xa02d 221 (Alaska App. 1989).  While people living together might typically be accommodating to the wishes of their cotenants, requests for police assistance may well come from coinhabitants who are having a disagreement.  The Court concludes that because \xe2\x80\x9cno sensible person would go inside\xe2\x80\x9d in the face of disputed consent, <em>ante</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939, and the consenting cotenant thus has \xe2\x80\x9cno recognized authority\xe2\x80\x9d to insist on the guest\xe2\x80\x99s admission, <em>ante</em>, at 10, a \xe2\x80\x9cpolice officer [has] no better claim to reasonableness in entering than the officer would have in the absence of any consent at all,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  But the police officer\xe2\x80\x99s superior claim to enter is obvious: Mrs. Randolph did not invite the police to join her for dessert and coffee; the officer\xe2\x80\x99s precise purpose in knocking on the door was to assist with a dispute between the Randolphs\xe2\x80\x94one in which Mrs. Randolph felt the need for the protective presence of the police.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule apparently forbids police from entering to assist with a domestic dispute if the abuser whose behavior prompted the request for police assistance objects.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority acknowledges these concerns, but dismisses them on the ground that its rule can be expected to give rise to exigent situations, and police can then rely on an exigent circumstances exception to justify entry.  <em>Ante</em>, at 12, n.\xc2\xa06.  This is a strange way to justify a rule, and the fact that alternative justifications for entry might arise does not show that entry pursuant to consent is unreasonable.  In addition, it is far from clear that an exception for emergency entries suffices to protect the safety of occupants in domestic disputes.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>United States </em>v. <em>Davis</em>, 290 F.\xc2\xa03d 1239, 1240\xe2\x80\x931241 (CA10 2002) (finding no exigent circumstances justifying entry when police responded to a report of domestic abuse, officers heard no noise upon arrival, defendant told officers that his wife was out of town, and wife then appeared at the door seemingly unharmed but resisted husband\xe2\x80\x99s efforts to close the door).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than give effect to a consenting spouse\xe2\x80\x99s authority to permit entry into her house to avoid such situations, the majority again alters established Fourth Amendment rules to defend giving veto power to the objecting spouse.  In response to the concern that police might be turned away under its rule before entry can be justified based on exigency, the majority creates a new rule: A \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d to enter, coupled with one occupant\xe2\x80\x99s consent, will ensure that a police officer is \xe2\x80\x9clawfully in the premises.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13, 14.  As support for this \xe2\x80\x9cconsent plus a good reason\xe2\x80\x9d rule, the majority cites a treatise, which itself refers only to <em>emergency</em> entries.  <em>Ante</em>, at 14 (citing 4 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa78.3(d), p. 161 (4th ed. 2004)).  For the sake of defending what it concedes are fine, formalistic lines, the majority spins out an entirely new framework for analyzing exigent circumstances.  Police may now enter with a \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d to believe that \xe2\x80\x9cviolence (or threat of violence) has just occurred or is about to (or soon will) occur.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  And apparently a key factor allowing entry with a \xe2\x80\x9cgood reason\xe2\x80\x9d short of exigency is the very consent of one co-occupant the majority finds so inadequate in the first place.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority\xe2\x80\x99s analysis alters a great deal of established Fourth Amendment law.  The majority imports the concept of \xe2\x80\x9csocial expectations,\xe2\x80\x9d previously used only to determine when a search has occurred and whether a particular person has standing to object to a search, into questions of consent.  <em>Ante</em>, at 6, 8.  To determine whether entry and search are reasonable, the majority considers a police officer\xe2\x80\x99s subjective motive in asking for consent, which we have otherwise refrained from doing in assessing Fourth Amendment questions.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  And the majority creates a new exception to the warrant requirement to justify warrantless entry short of exigency in potential domestic abuse situations.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Considering the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule is solely concerned with protecting a person who happens to be present at the door when a police officer asks his co-occupant for consent to search, but not one who is asleep in the next room or in the backyard gardening, the majority has taken a great deal of pain in altering Fourth Amendment doctrine, for precious little (if any) gain in privacy.  Perhaps one day, as the consequences of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s analytic approach become clearer, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will be treated the same way the majority treats our opinions in <em>Matlock </em>and <em>Rodriguez</em>\xe2\x80\x94as a \xe2\x80\x9cloose end\xe2\x80\x9d to be tied up.  <em>Ante</em>, at 17.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0One of the concurring opinions states that if it had to choose between a rule that a cotenant\xe2\x80\x99s consent was valid or a rule that it was not, it would choose the former.  <em>Ante</em>, at 1 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).  The concurrence advises, however, that \xe2\x80\x9cno single set of legal rules can capture the ever changing complexity of human life,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and joins what becomes the majority opinion, \xe2\x80\x9c[g]iven the case-specific nature of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 3.  What the majority establishes, in its own terms, is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>the rule</em> that a physically present inhabitant\xe2\x80\x99s express refusal of consent to a police search <em>is dispositive</em> as to him, regardless of the consent of a fellow occupant.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18 (emphases added).  The concurrence joins with the apparent \xe2\x80\x9cunderstandin[g]\xe2\x80\x9d that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9crule\xe2\x80\x9d is not a rule at all, but simply a \xe2\x80\x9ccase-specific\xe2\x80\x9d holding.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3 (opinion of Breyer,\xc2\xa0J.).  The end result is a complete lack of practical guidance for the police in the field, let alone for the lower courts.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our third-party consent cases have recognized that a person who shares common areas with others \xe2\x80\x9cassume[s] the risk that one of their number might permit the common area to be searched.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Matlock</em>, 415 U. S., at 171, n.\xc2\xa07.  The majority reminds us, in high tones, that a man\xe2\x80\x99s home is his castle, <em>ante</em>, at 10, but even under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, it is not his castle if he happens to be absent, asleep in the keep, or otherwise engaged when the constable arrives at the gate.  Then it is his co-owner\xe2\x80\x99s castle.  And, of course, it is not his castle if he wants to consent to entry, but his co-owner objects.  Rather than constitutionalize such an arbitrary rule, we should acknowledge that a decision to share a private place, like a decision to share a secret or a confidential document, necessarily entails the risk that those with whom we share may in turn choose to share\xe2\x80\x94for their own protection or for other reasons\xe2\x80\x94with the police.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The majority considers this comparison to be a \xe2\x80\x9cfalse equation,\xe2\x80\x9d and even discerns \xe2\x80\x9ca deliberate intent to devalue the importance of the privacy of a dwelling place.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311, n.\xc2\xa04.  But the differences between the majority and this dissent reduce to this: Under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, police may not enter and search when an objecting co-occupant is <em>present at the door</em>, but they <em>may</em> do so when he is asleep in the next room; under our view, the co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s consent is effective in both cases.  It seems a bit overwrought to characterize the former approach as affording great protection to a man in his castle, the latter as signaling that \xe2\x80\x9cthe centuries of special protection for the privacy of the home are over.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The Court in <em>United States</em> v. <em>Matlock</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/415/164/index.html"></a><a href="/us/415/164/index.html">415 U.

The point, of course, is not that a person waives his privacy by sharing space with others such that police may enter at will, but that sharing space necessarily entails a limited yielding of privacy <em>to the person with whom the space is shared</em>, such that the other person shares authority to consent to a search of the shared space.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2, 5\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In response to this concern, the majority asserts that its rule applies \xe2\x80\x9cmerely [to] evidentiary searches.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 14.  But the fundamental premise of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that an inviting co-occupant has \xe2\x80\x9cno recognized authority\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9copen the door\xe2\x80\x9d over a co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s objection.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10; see also <em>ante</em>, at 1 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] physically present co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s stated refusal to permit <em>entry</em> prevails, rendering the warrantless search unreasonable and invalid as to him\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] caller standing at the door of shared premises would have no confidence \xe2\x80\xa6 to <em>enter</em> when a fellow tenant stood there saying \xe2\x80\x98stay out\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <em>ante</em>, at 10 (\xe2\x80\x9c[A] disputed invitation, without more, gives a police officer no \xe2\x80\xa6 claim to reasonableness in <em>entering</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The point is that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule transforms what may have begun as a request for consent to conduct an evidentiary search into something else altogether, by giving veto power over the consenting co-occupant\xe2\x80\x99s wishes to an occupant who would exclude the police from <em>entry</em>.  The majority would afford the now quite vulnerable consenting co-occupant sufficient time to gather her belongings and leave, see <em>ante</em>, at 13, apparently putting to one side the fact that it is her castle, too.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
