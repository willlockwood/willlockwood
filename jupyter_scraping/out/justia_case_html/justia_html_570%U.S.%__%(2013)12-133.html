The District Court granted the motion and dismissed the lawsuits.

Respondents argue that requiring them to litigate their claims individually\xe2\x80\x94as they contracted to do\xe2\x80\x94would contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.  But the antitrust laws do not guarantee an affordable procedural path to the vindi- cation of every claim.  Congress has taken some measures to facilitate the litigation of antitrust claims\xe2\x80\x94for example, it enacted a multiplied-damages remedy.

In enacting such measures, Congress has told us that it is willing to go, in certain respects, beyond the normal limits of law in advancing its goals of deterring and remedying unlawful trade practice.  But to say that Congress must have intended whatever departures from those normal limits advance antitrust goals is simply irrational.  \xe2\x80\x9c[N]o legislation pursues its purposes at all costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rodriguez v.

Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614, \n628 (1985)\n.  The Sherman and Clayton Acts make no mention of class actions.  In fact, they were enacted decades before the advent of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which was \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to allow an exception to the usual rule that litigation is conducted by and on behalf of the individual named parties only.\xe2\x80\x9d  Califano v. Yamasaki, \n\n442 U.\xc2\xa0S. 682\n\xe2\x80\x93701 (1979).  The parties here agreed to arbitrate pursuant to that \xe2\x80\x9cusual rule,\xe2\x80\x9d and it would be remarkable for a court to erase that expectation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor does congressional approval of Rule 23 establish an entitlement to class proceedings for the vindication of statutory rights.  To begin with, it is likely that such an entitlement, invalidating private arbitration agreements denying class adjudication, would be an \xe2\x80\x9cabridg[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d or modif[ication]\xe2\x80\x9d of a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive right\xe2\x80\x9d forbidden to the Rules, see \n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72072(b).  But there is no evidence of such an entitlement in any event.  The Rule imposes stringent requirements for certification that in practice exclude most claims.  And we have specifically rejected the assertion that one of those requirements (the class-notice requirement) must be dispensed with because the \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitively high cost\xe2\x80\x9d of compliance would \xe2\x80\x9cfrustrate [plain- tiff\xe2\x80\x99s] attempt to vindicate the policies underlying the antitrust\xe2\x80\x9d laws.

One might respond, perhaps, that federal law secures a nonwaivable opportunity to vindicate federal policies by satisfying the procedural strictures of Rule 23 or invoking some other informal class mechanism in arbitration.  But we have already rejected that proposition in AT&amp;T Mobility, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur finding of no \xe2\x80\x9ccontrary congressional command\xe2\x80\x9d does not end the case.  Respondents invoke a judge-made exception to the FAA which, they say, serves to harmonize competing federal policies by allowing courts to invalidate agreements that prevent the \xe2\x80\x9ceffective vindication\xe2\x80\x9d of a federal statutory right.  Enforcing the waiver of class arbitration bars effective vindication, respondents contend, because they have no economic incentive to pursue their antitrust claims individually in arbitration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe \xe2\x80\x9ceffective vindication\xe2\x80\x9d exception to which respondents allude originated as dictum in Mitsubishi Motors, where we expressed a willingness to invalidate, on \xe2\x80\x9cpublic policy\xe2\x80\x9d grounds, arbitration agreements that \xe2\x80\x9coperat[e] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a prospective waiver of a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to pursue statutory remedies.\xe2\x80\x9d  473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, n.\xc2\xa019 (emphasis added).  Dismissing concerns that the arbitral forum was inadequate, we said that \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum, the statute will continue to serve both its remedial and deterrent function.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 637.  Subsequent cases have similarly asserted the existence of an \xe2\x80\x9ceffective vindication\xe2\x80\x9d exception, see, e.g., 14 Penn Plaza LLC v.

That would certainly cover a provision in an arbitration agreement forbidding the assertion of certain statutory rights.  And it would perhaps cover filing and administrative fees attached to arbitration that are so high as to make access to the forum impracticable.  See Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79, \n90 (2000)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cIt may well be that the existence of large arbitration costs could preclude a litigant .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. from effectively vindicating her federal statutory rights\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the fact that it is not worth the expense involved in proving a statutory remedy does not constitute the elimination of the right to pursue that remedy.  See 681 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 147 (Jacobs, C.

In Gilmer, supra, we had no qualms in enforcing a class waiver in an arbitration agreement even though the federal statute at issue, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ex- pressly permitted collective actions.  We said that statutory permission did \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98not mean that individual attempts at conciliation were intended to be barred.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 32.  And in Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528 (1995)\n, we held that requiring arbitration in a foreign country was compatible with the federal Carriage of Goods by Sea Act.

In this case, Italian Colors makes two arguments to support its conclusion that the arbitration agreement should not be enforced.  First, it contends that enforcing the arbitration agreement \xe2\x80\x9cwould contravene the policies of the antitrust laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 4.  Second, it contends that a court may \xe2\x80\x9cinvalidate agreements that prevent the \xe2\x80\x98ef- fective vindication\xe2\x80\x99 of a federal statutory right.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6.

The owner of a small restaurant (Italian Colors) thinks that American Express (Amex) has used its monopoly power to force merchants to accept a form contract violating the antitrust laws.  The restaurateur wants to challenge the allegedly unlawful provision (imposing a tying arrangement), but the same contract\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause prevents him from doing so.  That term imposes a variety of procedural bars that would make pursuit of the antitrust claim a fool\xe2\x80\x99s errand.  So if the arbitration clause is enforceable, Amex has insulated itself from antitrust liability\xe2\x80\x94even if it has in fact violated the law.  The monopolist gets to use its monopoly power to insist on a contract effectively depriving its victims of all legal recourse.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd here is the nutshell version of today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, admirably flaunted rather than camouflaged: Too darn bad.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat answer is a betrayal of our precedents, and of federal statutes like the antitrust laws.  Our decisions have developed a mechanism\xe2\x80\x94called the effective-vindication rule\xe2\x80\x94to prevent arbitration clauses from choking off a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce congressionally created rights.  That doctrine bars applying such a clause when (but only when) it operates to confer immunity from potentially meritorious federal claims.  In so doing, the rule reconciles the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) with all the rest of federal law\xe2\x80\x94and indeed, promotes the most fundamental purposes of the FAA itself.  As applied here, the rule would ensure that Amex\xe2\x80\x99s arbitration clause does not foreclose Italian Colors from vindicating its right to redress antitrust harm.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority barely tries to explain why it reaches a contrary result.  It notes that we have not decided this exact case before\xe2\x80\x94neglecting that the principle we have established fits this case hand in glove.  And it concocts a special exemption for class-arbitration waivers\xe2\x80\x94ignoring that this case concerns much more than that.  Throughout, the majority disregards our decisions\xe2\x80\x99 central tenet: An arbitration clause may not thwart federal law, ir-respective of exactly how it does so.  Because the Court today prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory rights, I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStart with an uncontroversial proposition: We would refuse to enforce an exculpatory clause insulating a company from antitrust liability\xe2\x80\x94say, \xe2\x80\x9cMerchants may bring no Sherman Act claims\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94even if that clause were contained in an arbitration agreement.  See ante, at 6.  Congress created the Sherman Act\xe2\x80\x99s private cause of action not solely to compensate individuals, but to promote \xe2\x80\x9cthe public interest in vigilant enforcement of the antitrust laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lawlor v. National Screen Service Corp., \n\n349 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322, \n329 (1955)\n.  Accordingly, courts will not enforce a prospective waiver of the right to gain redress for an antitrust injury, whether in an arbitration agreement or any other contract.  See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc., \n\n473 U.\xc2\xa0S. 614\n, and n. 19 (1985).  The same rule applies to other important federal statutory rights.  See 14 Penn Plaza LLC v. Pyett, \n\n556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 247, \n273 (2009)\n (Age Discrimination in Employment Act); Brooklyn Savings Bank v. O\xe2\x80\x99Neil, \n\n324 U.\xc2\xa0S. 697, \n704 (1945)\n (Fair Labor Standards Act).  But its necessity is nowhere more evident than in the antitrust context.  Without the rule, a company could use its monopoly power to protect its monopoly power, by coercing agreement to contractual terms eliminating its antitrust liability.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIf the rule were limited to baldly exculpatory provi-sions, however, a monopolist could devise numerous ways around it.  Consider several alternatives that a party drafting an arbitration agreement could adopt to avoid antitrust liability, each of which would have the identical effect.  On the front end: The agreement might set outlandish filing fees or establish an absurd (e.g., one-day) statute of limitations, thus preventing a claimant from gaining access to the arbitral forum.  On the back end: The agreement might remove the arbitrator\xe2\x80\x99s authority to grant meaningful relief, so that a judgment gets the claimant nothing worthwhile.  And in the middle: The agreement might block the claimant from presenting the kind of proof that is necessary to establish the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liability\xe2\x80\x94say, by prohibiting any economic testimony (good luck proving an antitrust claim without that!).  Or else the agreement might appoint as an arbitrator an obviously biased person\xe2\x80\x94say, the CEO of Amex.  The possibilities are endless\xe2\x80\x94all less direct than an express exculpatory clause, but no less fatal.  So the rule against prospective waivers of federal rights can work only if it applies not just to a contract clause explicitly barring a claim, but to others that operate to do so.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd sure enough, our cases establish this proposition: An arbitration clause will not be enforced if it prevents the effective vindication of federal statutory rights, however it achieves that result.  The rule originated in Mitsubishi, where we held that claims brought under the Sherman Act and other federal laws are generally subject to arbitration.  473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 628.  By agreeing to arbitrate such a claim, we explained, \xe2\x80\x9ca party does not forgo the substantive rights afforded by the statute; it only submits to their resolution in an arbitral, rather than a judicial, forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But crucial to our decision was a limiting principle, designed to safeguard federal rights: An arbitration clause will be enforced only \xe2\x80\x9cso long as the prospective litigant effectively may vindicate its statutory cause of action in the arbitral forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 637.  If an arbitration provision \xe2\x80\x9coperated .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a prospective waiver of a party\xe2\x80\x99s right to pursue statutory remedies,\xe2\x80\x9d we emphasized, we would \xe2\x80\x9ccondemn[\xc2\xa0]\xe2\x80\x9d it.  Id., at 637, n.\xc2\xa019.  Similarly, we stated that such a clause should be \xe2\x80\x9cset[\xc2\xa0] aside\xe2\x80\x9d if \xe2\x80\x9cproceedings in the contractual forum will be so gravely difficult\xe2\x80\x9d that the claimant \xe2\x80\x9cwill for all practical purposes be deprived of his day in court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 632 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And in the decades since Mitsubishi, we have repeated its admonition time and again, instructing courts not to enforce an arbitration agreement that effectively (even if not explicitly) forecloses a plaintiff from remedying the violation of a federal statutory right.  See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20, \n28 (1991)\n; Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 528, \n540 (1995)\n; 14 Penn Plaza, 556 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 266, 273\xe2\x80\x93274.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOur decision in Green Tree Financial Corp.-Ala. v. Randolph, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 79 (2000)\n, confirmed that this principle applies when an agreement thwarts federal law by making arbitration prohibitively expensive.  The plaintiff there (seeking relief under the Truth in Lending Act) argued that an arbitration agreement was unenforceable be- cause it \xe2\x80\x9ccreate[d] a risk\xe2\x80\x9d that she would have to \xe2\x80\x9cbear prohibitive arbitration costs\xe2\x80\x9d in the form of high filing and administrative fees.  Id., at 90 (internal quotation marks omitted).  We rejected that contention, but not because we doubted that such fees could prevent the effective vindication of statutory rights.  To the contrary, we invoked our rule from Mitsubishi, making clear that it applied to the case before us.  See 538 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 90.  Indeed, we added a burden of proof: \xe2\x80\x9c[W]here, as here,\xe2\x80\x9d we held, a party asserting a federal right \xe2\x80\x9cseeks to invalidate an arbitration agreement on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, that party bears the burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 92.  Randolph, we found, had failed to meet that burden: The evidence she offered was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo speculative.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 91.  But even as we dismissed Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s suit, we reminded courts to protect against arbitration agreements that make federal claims too costly to bring.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tApplied as our precedents direct, the effective-vindication rule furthers the purposes not just of laws like the Sherman Act, but of the FAA itself.  That statute reflects a federal policy favoring actual arbitration\xe2\x80\x94that is, arbitration as a streamlined \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of resolving disputes,\xe2\x80\x9d not as a foolproof way of killing off valid claims.  Rodriguez de Quijas v. Shearson/American Express, Inc., \n\n490 U.\xc2\xa0S. 477, \n481 (1989)\n.  Put otherwise: What the FAA prefers to litigation is arbitration, not de\xc2\xa0facto immunity.  The effective-vindication rule furthers the statute\xe2\x80\x99s goals by ensuring that arbitration remains a real, not faux, method of dispute resolution.  With the rule, companies have good reason to adopt arbitral procedures that facilitate efficient and accurate handling of complaints.  Without it, companies have every incentive to draft their agreements to extract backdoor waivers of statutory rights, making arbitration unavailable or pointless.  So down one road: More arbitration, better enforcement of federal statutes.  And down the other: Less arbitration, poorer enforcement of federal statutes.  Which would you prefer?  Or still more aptly: Which do you think Congress would?\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe answer becomes all the more obvious given the limits we have placed on the rule, which ensure that it does not diminish arbitration\xe2\x80\x99s benefits.  The rule comes into play only when an agreement \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a prospective waiver\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94that is, forecloses (not diminishes) a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s opportunity to gain relief for a statutory violation.  Mitsubishi, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, n.\xc2\xa019.  So, for example, Randolph assessed whether fees in arbitration would be \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitive\xe2\x80\x9d (not high, excessive, or extravagant).  531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 90.  Moreover, the plaintiff must make that showing through concrete proof: \xe2\x80\x9c[S]peculative\xe2\x80\x9d risks, \xe2\x80\x9cunfounded assumptions,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cunsupported statements\xe2\x80\x9d will not suffice.  Id., at 90\xe2\x80\x9391, and n.\xc2\xa06.  With the inquiry that confined and the evidentiary requirements that high, courts have had no trouble assessing the matters the rule makes relevant.  And for almost three decades, courts have followed our edict that arbitration clauses must usually prevail, declining to enforce them in only rare cases.  See Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 26\xe2\x80\x9327.  The effective-vindication rule has thus operated year in and year out without undermining, much less \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy[ing],\xe2\x80\x9d the prospect of speedy dispute resolution that arbitration secures.  Ante, at 9.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd this is just the kind of case the rule was meant to address.  Italian Colors, as I have noted, alleges that Amex used its market power to impose a tying arrangement in violation of the Sherman Act.  The antitrust laws, all parties agree, provide the restaurant with a cause of action and give it the chance to recover treble damages.  Here, that would mean Italian Colors could take home up to $38,549.  But a problem looms.  As this case comes to us, the evidence shows that Italian Colors cannot prevail in arbitration without an economic analysis defining the relevant markets, establishing Amex\xe2\x80\x99s monopoly power, showing anticompetitive effects, and measuring damages.  And that expert report would cost between several hundred thousand and one million dollars.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  So the expense involved in proving the claim in arbitration is ten times what Italian Colors could hope to gain, even in a best-case scenario.  That counts as a \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitive\xe2\x80\x9d cost, in Randolph\xe2\x80\x99s terminology, if anything does.  No rational actor would bring a claim worth tens of thousands of dollars if doing so meant incurring costs in the hundreds of thousands.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAn arbitration agreement could manage such a mismatch in many ways, but Amex\xe2\x80\x99s disdains them all.  As the Court makes clear, the contract expressly prohibits class arbitration.  But that is only part of the problem.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  The agreement also disallows any kind of joinder or consolidation of claims or parties.  And more:  Its confidentiality provision prevents Italian Colors from informally arranging with other merchants to produce a common expert report.  And still more: The agreement precludes any shifting of costs to Amex, even if Italian Colors prevails.  And beyond all that: Amex refused to enter into any stipulations that would obviate or mitigate the need for the economic analysis.  In short, the agreement as applied in this case cuts off not just class arbitration, but any avenue for sharing, shifting, or shrinking necessary costs.  Amex has put Italian Colors to this choice: Spend way, way, way more money than your claim is worth, or relinquish your Sherman Act rights.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo contra the majority, the court below got this case right.  Italian Colors proved what the plaintiff in Randolph could not\xe2\x80\x94that a standard-form agreement, taken as a whole, renders arbitration of a claim \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitively expensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 92.  The restaurant thus established that the contract \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. as a prospective waiver,\xe2\x80\x9d and prevents the \xe2\x80\x9ceffective[\xc2\xa0] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. vindicat[ion]\xe2\x80\x9d of Sherman Act rights.  Mitsubishi, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, and n. 19.  I would follow our precedents and decline to compel arbitration.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe majority is quite sure that the effective-vindication rule does not apply here, but has precious little to say about why.  It starts by disparaging the rule as having \xe2\x80\x9coriginated as dictum.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 6.  But it does not rest on that swipe, and for good reason.  As I have explained, see supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, the rule began as a core part of Mitsubishi: We held there that federal statutory claims are subject to arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cso long as\xe2\x80\x9d the claimant \xe2\x80\x9ceffectively may vindicate its [rights] in the arbitral forum.\xe2\x80\x9d  473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637 (emphasis added).  The rule thus served as an essential condition of the decision\xe2\x80\x99s holding.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  And in Randolph, we provided a standard for applying the rule when a claimant alleges \xe2\x80\x9cprohibitive costs\xe2\x80\x9d (\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, as here,\xe2\x80\x9d etc., see supra, at 5), and we then applied that standard to the parties before us.  So whatever else the majority might think of the effective-vindication rule, it is not dictum.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe next paragraph of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision (the third of Part IV) is the key: It contains almost the whole of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s effort to explain why the effective-vindication rule does not stop Amex from compelling arbitration.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s first move is to describe Mitsubishi and Randolph as covering only discrete situations: The rule, the majority asserts, applies to arbitration agreements that eliminate the \xe2\x80\x9cright to pursue statutory remedies\xe2\x80\x9d by \xe2\x80\x9cforbidding the assertion\xe2\x80\x9d of the right (as addressed in Mitsubishi) or imposing filing and administrative fees \xe2\x80\x9cso high as to make access to the forum impracticable\xe2\x80\x9d (as addressed in Randolph).  Ante, at 6 (emphasis deleted; internal quotation marks omitted).  Those cases are not this case, the majority says: Here, the agreement\xe2\x80\x99s provisions went to the possibility of \xe2\x80\x9cproving a statutory rem-edy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut the distinction the majority proffers, which excludes problems of proof, is one Mitsubishi and Randolph (and our decisions reaffirming them) foreclose.  Those decisions establish what in some quarters is known as a principle: When an arbitration agreement prevents the effective vindication of federal rights, a party may go to court.   That principle, by its nature, operates in diverse circumstances\xe2\x80\x94not just the ones that happened to come before the Court.  See supra, at 3\xe2\x80\x934.  It doubtless covers the baldly exculpatory clause and prohibitive fees that the majority acknowledges would preclude an arbitration agreement\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.  But so too it covers the world of other provisions a clever drafter might devise to scuttle even the most meritorious federal claims.  Those provisions might deny entry to the forum in the first instance.  Or they might deprive the claimant of any remedy.  Or they might prevent the claimant from offering the necessary proof to prevail, as in my \xe2\x80\x9cno economic testimony\xe2\x80\x9d hypothetical\xe2\x80\x94and in the actual circumstances of this case.  See supra, at 3.  The variations matter not at all.  Whatever the precise mechanism, each \xe2\x80\x9coperate[s] . . . as a prospective waiver of a party\xe2\x80\x99s [federal] right[s]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94and so confers immunity on a wrongdoer.  Mitsubishi, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, n.\xc2\xa019.  And that is what counts under our decisions.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNor can the majority escape the principle we have established by observing, as it does at one point, that Amex\xe2\x80\x99s agreement merely made arbitration \xe2\x80\x9cnot worth the expense.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7.  That suggestion, after all, runs smack into Randolph, which likewise involved an allegation that arbitration, as specified in a contract, \xe2\x80\x9cwould be prohibitively expensive.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 92.  Our decision there made clear that a provision raising a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s costs could foreclose consideration of federal claims, and so run afoul of the effective-vindication rule.  The expense at issue in Randolph came from a filing fee combined with a per-diem payment for the arbitrator.  But nothing about those particular costs is distinctive; and indeed, a rule confined to them would be weirdly idiosyncratic.  Not surprisingly, then, Randolph gave no hint of distinguishing among the different ways an arbitration agreement can make a claim too costly to bring.  Its rationale applies whenever an agreement makes the vindication of federal claims impossibly expensive\xe2\x80\x94whether by imposing fees or proscribing cost-sharing or adopting some other device.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat leaves the three last sentences in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s core paragraph.  Here, the majority conjures a special reason to exclude \xe2\x80\x9cclass-action waiver[s]\xe2\x80\x9d from the effective-vindication rule\xe2\x80\x99s compass.  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, and n. 4.   Rule 23, the majority notes, became law only in 1938\xe2\x80\x94decades after the Sherman Act.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion: If federal law in the interim decades did not eliminate a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s rights under that Act, then neither does this agreement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut that notion, first of all, rests on a false premise: that this case is only about a class-action waiver.  See ante, at 7, n.\xc2\xa04 (confining the case to that issue).  It is not, and indeed could not sensibly be.  The effective-vindication rule asks whether an arbitration agreement as a whole precludes a claimant from enforcing federal statutory rights.  No single provision is properly viewed in isolation, because an agreement can close off one avenue to pursue a claim while leaving others open.  In this case, for example, the agreement could have prohibited class arbitration without offending the effective-vindication rule if it had provided an alternative mechanism to share, shift, or reduce the necessary costs.  The agreement\xe2\x80\x99s problem is that it bars not just class actions, but also all mechanisms\xe2\x80\x94many existing long before the Sherman Act, if that matters\xe2\x80\x94for joinder or consolidation of claims, informal coordination among individual claimants, or amelioration of arbitral expenses.  See supra, at 7.  And contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, the Second Circuit well understood that point: It considered, for example, whether Italian Colors could shift expert expenses to Amex if its claim prevailed (no) or could join with merchants bringing similar claims to produce a common expert report (no again).  See 554 F.\xc2\xa03d 300, 318 (2009).  It is only in this Court that the case has become strangely narrow, as the majority stares at a single provision rather than considering, in the way the effective-vindication rule demands, how the entire contract operates.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any event, the age of the relevant procedural mechanisms (whether class actions or any other) does not matter, because the effective-vindication rule asks about the world today, not the world as it might have looked when Congress passed a given statute.  Whether a particular procedural device preceded or post-dated a particular statute, the question remains the same: Does the arbi-tration agreement foreclose a party\xe2\x80\x94right now\xe2\x80\x94from effectively vindicating the substantive rights the statute provides?  This case exhibits a whole raft of changes since Congress passed the Sherman Act, affecting both parties to the dispute\xe2\x80\x94not just new procedural rules (like Rule 23), but also new evidentiary requirements (like the demand here for an expert report) and new contract provisions affecting arbitration (like this agreement\xe2\x80\x99s confidentiality clause).  But what has stayed the same is this: Congress\xe2\x80\x99s intent that antitrust plaintiffs should be able to enforce their rights free of any prior waiver.  See supra, at 2\xe2\x80\x933; Mitsubishi, 473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 637, n.\xc2\xa019.  The effective-vindication rule carries out that purpose by ensuring that any arbitration agreement operating as such a waiver is unenforceable.  And that requires courts to determine in the here and now\xe2\x80\x94rather than in ye olde glory days\xe2\x80\x94whether an agreement\xe2\x80\x99s provisions foreclose even meritorious antitrust claims.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tStill, the majority takes one last stab: \xe2\x80\x9cTruth to tell,\xe2\x80\x9d it claims, AT&amp;T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion, 563 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2011), \xe2\x80\x9call but resolves this case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 8.  In that decision, the majority recounts, this Court held that the FAA preempted a state \xe2\x80\x9claw conditioning enforcement of arbitration on the availability of class procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.; see 563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 9).  According to the majority, that decision controls here because \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e specifically rejected the argument that class arbitration was necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 9.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhere to begin?  Well, maybe where I just left off:  Italian Colors is not claiming that a class action is necessary\xe2\x80\x94only that it have some means of vindicating a meritorious claim.  And as I have shown, non-class options abound.  See supra, at 11.  The idea that AT&amp;T Mobility controls here depends entirely on the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view that this case is \xe2\x80\x9cclass action or bust.\xe2\x80\x9d  Were the majority to drop that pretense, it could make no claim for AT&amp;T Mobility\xe2\x80\x99s relevance.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd just as this case is not about class actions, AT&amp;T Mobility was not\xe2\x80\x94and could not have been\xe2\x80\x94about the effective-vindication rule.  Here is a tip-off: AT&amp;T Mobility nowhere cited our effective-vindication precedents.  That was so for two reasons.  To begin with, the state law in question made class-action waivers unenforceable even when a party could feasibly vindicate her claim in an individual arbitration.  The state rule was designed to preserve the broad-scale \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrent effects of class actions,\xe2\x80\x9d not merely to protect a particular plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s right to assert her own claim.  563 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 3).  Indeed, the Court emphasized that the complaint in that case was \xe2\x80\x9cmost unlikely to go unresolved\xe2\x80\x9d because AT&amp;T\xe2\x80\x99s agreement contained a host of features ensuring that \xe2\x80\x9caggrieved customers who filed claims would be essentially guaranteed to be made whole.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  So the Court professed that AT&amp;T Mobility did not implicate the only thing (a party\xe2\x80\x99s ability to vindicate a meritorious claim) this case involves.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd if that is not enough, AT&amp;T Mobility involved a state law, and therefore could not possibly implicate the effective-vindication rule.  When a state rule allegedly conflicts with the FAA, we apply standard preemption principles, asking whether the state law frustrates the FAA\xe2\x80\x99s purposes and objectives.  If the state rule does so\xe2\x80\x94as the Court found in AT&amp;T Mobility\xe2\x80\x94the Supremacy Clause requires its invalidation.  We have no earthly interest (quite the contrary) in vindicating that law.  Our effective-vindication rule comes into play only when the FAA is alleged to conflict with another federal law, like the Sherman Act here.  In that all-federal context, one law does not automatically bow to the other, and the effective-vindication rule serves as a way to reconcile any tension between them.  Again, then, AT&amp;T Mobility had no occasion to address the issue in this case.  The relevant decisions are instead Mitsubishi and Randolph.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court today mistakes what this case is about.  To a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  And to a Court bent on diminishing the usefulness of Rule 23, everything looks like a class action, ready to be dismantled.  So the Court does not consider that Amex\xe2\x80\x99s agreement bars not just class actions, but \xe2\x80\x9cother forms of cost-sharing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. that could provide effective vindication.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7, n.\xc2\xa04.  In short, the Court does not consider\xe2\x80\x94and does not decide\xe2\x80\x94Italian Colors\xe2\x80\x99s (and similarly situated litigants\xe2\x80\x99) actual argument about why the effective-vindication rule precludes this agreement\xe2\x80\x99s enforcement.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAs a result, Amex\xe2\x80\x99s contract will succeed in depriving Italian Colors of any effective opportunity to challenge monopolistic conduct allegedly in violation of the Sherman Act.  The FAA, the majority says, so requires.  Do not be fooled.  Only the Court so requires; the FAA was never meant to produce this outcome.  The FAA conceived of arbitration as a \xe2\x80\x9cmethod of resolving disputes\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94a way of using tailored and streamlined procedures to facilitate redress of injuries.  Rodriguez de Quijas, 490 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 481 (emphasis added).  In the hands of today\xe2\x80\x99s majority, arbitration threatens to become more nearly the opposite\xe2\x80\x94a mechanism easily made to block the vindication of meritorious federal claims and insulate wrongdoers from liability.  The Court thus undermines the FAA no less than it does the Sherman Act and other federal statutes providing rights of action.  I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The evidence relating to these costs comes from an affidavit submitted by an economist experienced in proving similar antitrust claims.  The Second Circuit found that Amex \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] brought no serious challenge\xe2\x80\x9d to that factual showing.  See, e.g., 667 F.\xc2\xa03d 204, 210 (2012).  And in this Court, Amex conceded that Italian Colors would need an expert economic report to prevail in arbitration.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 15.  Perhaps that is not really true.  A hallmark of arbitration is its use of procedures tailored to the type of dispute and amount in controversy; so arbitrators might properly decline to demand such a rigorous evidentiary showing in small antitrust cases.  But that possibility cannot disturb the factual premise on which this case comes to us, and which the majority accepts: that Italian Colors\xe2\x80\x99s tying claim is an ordinary kind of antitrust claim; and that it is worth about a tenth the cost of arbitration.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The majority contends that the class-action waiver is the only part we should consider.  See ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa04.  I explain below why that assertion is wrong.

What the Mitsubishi Court had \xe2\x80\x9cno occasion to speculate on\xe2\x80\x9d was whether a particular agreement in fact eliminated the claimant\xe2\x80\x99s federal rights.  473 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 673, n.\xc2\xa019.

The plaintiffs there did not claim, as Italian Colors does, that an arbitration clause altogether precluded them from vindicating their federal rights.  They averred only that arbitration would be less convenient or effective than a proceeding in court.  See Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., \n\xe2\x80\x9332 (1991); Vimar Seguros y Reaseguros, S. A. v. M/V Sky Reefer, \n.  As I have explained, that kind of showing does not meet the effective-vindication rule\xe2\x80\x99s high bar.  See supra, at 6.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">5</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0In defense of this focus, the majority quotes the Second Circuit as concluding that \xe2\x80\x9cthe only economically feasible means\xe2\x80\x9d for Italian Colors to enforce its statutory rights \xe2\x80\x9cis via a class action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 7\xe2\x80\x938, n.\xc2\xa04 (quoting 667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 218; internal quotation marks omitted; emphasis added by the Court).  But the Court of Appeals reached that conclusion only after finding that the agreement prohibited all other forms of cost-sharing and cost-shifting.  See 554 F.\xc2\xa03d 300, 318 (2009).  (That opinion was vacated on other grounds, but its analysis continued to inform\xe2\x80\x94indeed, was essential to\xe2\x80\x94the Second Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s final decision in the case.  See 667 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 218.)  The Second Circuit therefore did exactly what the majority refuses to do\xe2\x80\x94look to the agreement as a whole to determine whether it permits the vindication of federal rights.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
