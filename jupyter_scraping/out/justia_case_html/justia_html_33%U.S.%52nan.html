Lear, 33 U.S. 8 Pet. 52 52 (1834)</h3><p><b>Armstrong v. Lear</b></p><p><b>33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 52</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>A bill was filed in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia claiming a legacy under an alleged codicil made in Paris to a will made in the United States.  The testator was a native of Poland; at the time of the making of the codicil he resided in France, and when be made the will to which the instrument upon which the legacy was claimed was said to be a codicil, he was in the United</p>\n<p>states.  He went to Europe soon after he made the will, and many years afterwards he died in Switzerland.  The bill alleged that the instrument on which the legacy was claimed had been duly proved in the Orphans\' Court of Washington County in the District of Columbia, where the administrator with the will annexed resided.  There was no allegation that the codicil had been established to be a valid will by the law of France, the place of the domicile of the testator where the same was made.  The administrator submitted to the court whether it would decree the payment of the money to the complainant</p>\n<p>"upon an instrument made under the circumstances and authenticated in the manner that the aforesaid instrument is, and whether the said instrument shall have effect to revoke or alter any part of said testators will, solemnly executed and left in the hands of his executor in this country,"</p>\n<p>&amp;c.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"This is certainly a very informal and loose mode of putting in issue (if upon the bill such a question can be tried) the validity of a will made in a foreign country whose laws are not brought before the court either by averment or evidence."</p>\n<p>The answer contains an allegation that certain persons residing in Europe have filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia against him, the administrator, claiming a large portion of the assets, if not the whole, as creditors or mortgagees of the testator, and certain persons, also residing in Europe, have filed another bill against him (it was probably meant in the same court) claiming the whole assets as heirs at law of the testator, and therefore as distributees of the said assets.  None of the parties to either of these latter bills is made party to the present bill.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"The persons claiming as heirs of the testator should be made parties, that they may have an opportunity to test the plaintiffs title as the real parties in interest, the administrator being but a mere stockholder."</p>\n<p>The heirs and legal representatives of the testator filed a bill in the circuit court claiming from the administrator of the testator with the will annexed the funds which had come into his hands, which bill is still pending.  The allegations in the bill go to defeat the validity of the will made in the United states, and also assert other grounds of claim.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"All the bills ought, if possible, to be brought to a hearing at the same time in the circuit court in order that a final disposition may at the same time be made of all the questions arising in all of them."</p>\n<p>If the intention is to put in issue (as it seems to be) not only the construction and operation of the testamentary instrument in favor of the plaintiff, but its validity and effect as a will, it is material that the law of France, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 33 U. S. 53</a></p><p> place of the domicile of the testator at the time of its execution should be brought before the court and established as matter of fact, for the court cannot judicially take notice of foreign laws, but they must be proved by proper evidence.  The present allegations of the bill and answer are quite too loose for this purpose, and they should be amended and made more distinct and direct.</p>\n<p>There may arise some nice questions of international law in which the fact of the domicile of the testator at the time of his birth, at the time of his making the will made in the United States, and at the time of his death may become material.  The Court does not mean to say what is the rule that is to govern in cases of wills of personalty, whether it be the rule of the native domicile or of the domicile at the time of the execution of the will or of the domicile at the death of the party where there have been changes of domicile.  These are points which ought, under the circumstances of this case, to be left open for argument.  But the facts on which the argument should rest ought to be distinctly averred in the bill and met in the answer.</p>\n<p>The place of domicile of the testator at the time of his death may also become material under another aspect of the case, <em>viz.,</em>  the question who are his heirs, entitled to the succession, <em>ab intestato,</em> or under the other will or wills executed by him, to which reference is made in some of the papers in the case.  The persons claiming as such heirs must establish their title under and according to the law of his domicile at the time of his death.  So that perhaps it may become material, if Switzerland was the domicile of the testator at the time of his death, to bring the law of that country distinctly, as matter of fact, before the court.</p>\n<p>On 1 April, 1829, the appellant Kosciuszko Armstrong filed a bill in the circuit court setting forth his citizenship of the State of New York and that Thade Kosciuszko, late an officer in the service of the United States in the war of their Revolution and of the Republic of Poland, on or about 5 May in the year 1798, placed a large sum in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, Esq., late President of the United States, far exceeding the sum of $10,000, and executed a will and testament, a copy of which is herewith filed and marked exhibit A, and which this complainant prays may be taken as a part of this his bill.  That afterwards, to-wit on or about 28 June in the year 1806, the said Thade Kosciuszko, being then domiciled at Paris, in the Kingdom of France, executed a certain instrument of writing, being in the nature and of the effect of a last will or writing testamentary, whereby he willed and directed that at his decease the sum of $3,704 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 33 U. S. 54</a></p><p> current money should be possessed by and delivered over to the full enjoyment and use of the complainant, and the said testator thereby instructed and authorized his only lawful executor in the United States, the said Thomas Jefferson, to reserve, in trust for that special purpose, of the funds he held belonging to the testator, the aforesaid sum of $3,704 in principal to the complainant, to be paid by him, the said Thomas Jefferson, immediately after his decease, to the complainant, and, in case of his death, to the use and benefit of his surviving brothers.  That the said testator, on the day and year aforesaid, duly signed and sealed the said instrument of writing in the presence of two competent witnesses, who attested the same, and acknowledged the same on the same day before Fulwar Skipwith, commercial agent and agent for prize causes for the said United States at Paris, and then delivered the same under his hand and seal to John Armstrong, father of the complainant.  That afterwards, to-wit on 15 October in the year 1817, the said Thade Kosciuszko departed this life, leaving the said instrument of writing unrevoked, and the same was, after the death of the said Thade Kosciuszko, admitted to probate and duly proved in the Orphan\'s Court of Washington County, a copy whereof, exhibit B, he prays may be taken as a part of his bill.</p>\n<p>That he is advised and believes that the said instrument of writing is, to all intents and purposes, a last will and testament, and must operate as such, and revokes <em>pro tanto</em> the bequests and appropriation made in the will first mentioned; that the said Thomas Jefferson, named as executor in the will first mentioned, refused to take out letters testamentary on the estate of the said Thade Kosciuszko and renounced all claim and right so to do, according to law, and Benjamin L. Lear, whom the complainant prays may be made defendant to this his bill, was duly appointed administrator with the will annexed on the said estate, which has since come into the hands of the said Benjamin L. Lear, far exceeding, as aforesaid, $10,000.  That the said Benjamin L. Lear has been frequently applied to by the complainant for the payment of the aforementioned legacy of $3,704, together with the interest thereon, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 33 U. S. 55</a></p><p> which the said Lear refuses to pay until the order and decree of this Court had upon the premises, and the said defendant combining and confederating with one Major Estho, a subject of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, and Monsieur Zeltner, formerly minister plenipotentiary of the Helvetic Republic at Paris, and now residing at Soleure in Switzerland, whom the complainant prays may be made parties to this his bill of complaint; the said confederates sometimes pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko never executed the said the last mentioned writing testamentary, and sometimes they pretend that the said Major Estho is the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, and as such entitled to all his said estate; and sometimes they pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko, during his lifetime, made some disposition of his said estate in favor of the children and other relatives of the said Zeltner, whereas the said last-mentioned writing testamentary was duly executed as aforesaid, and that the said Major Estho is not the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, or if he is that he is not entitled to receive distribution of the said personal estate, and that the said Thade Kosciuszko made no testamentary or other disposition in favor of the said Zeltner or his children or relatives which could affect the claim of the complainant under the said writing testamentary.  All which actings and doings and pretenses of the said confederates are contrary to equity and good conscience, and tend to the manifest injury and oppression of the complainant.</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Complainant\'s exhibit A</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"I, Thaddeus Kosciuszko, being just on my departure from America, do hereby declare and direct that, should I make no other testamentary disposition of my property in the United States, I hereby authorize my friend Thomas Jefferson to employ the whole thereof in purchasing negroes from among his own or any others, and giving them liberty in my name, in giving them an education in trades, or otherwise, and in having them instructed for their new condition in the duties of morality, which may make them good neighbors, good fathers or mothers, husbands or wives, and in their duties as citizens, teaching them to be defenders of their liberty and country </p><p><a class="page-number" name="56">Page 33 U.

And this defendant saith that he was, on 14 August in the year 1821, appointed by the Orphan\'s Court of the County of Washington, District of Columbia, the administrator with the will annexed of the estate of the said general Thaddeus Kosciuszko, and received from the said orphan\'s court letters of administration with said will annexed, a copy of which is herewith exhibited to this Court, marked defendant\'s exhibit C, and which this defendant prays may be taken as part of this his answer."</p>\n<p>"That after receiving said letters of administration, there came to the hands of this defendant from the said Thomas Jefferson, as the estate of said Kosciuszko, two certificates of the six percent stock of the United States -- one of $11,363.63 and the other of $1,136.36, and one certificate of stock of the Bank of Columbia of forty-six shares, amounting, at their par value, to $4,600.

S. 63</a></p><p> and $580.82 in cash.  This defendant, further answering to the bill of said complainant, saith that among the papers which came to his hands as hereinbefore mentioned is a letter from the aforesaid Mr. De Poletica to the said Thomas Jefferson enclosing a copy of a dispatch from the Viceroy of Poland to him, a copy of which letter and dispatch is herewith exhibited to this honorable court, marked defendant\'s exhibit D, and by which this defendant understands that the whole estate of said Kosciuszko may be claimed by a Major Estho, of Poland, as the heir at law of said Kosciuszko."</p>\n<p>"That this respondent communicated to said Poletica in April last such information as he possessed in relation to said estate, and was informed by said Politica that the same would be transmitted to the said Viceroy of Poland.  That there was also, among the papers aforesaid, two letters from a Mr. Zeltner to said Thomas Jefferson, copies of which are herewith exhibited, marked \'defendant\'s exhibit E,\' and \'defendant\'s exhibit F,\' by which this defendant understands that the said Kosciuszko has disposed of the greater part of his fortune in favor of the children, nieces, brothers, and sister of the said Zeltner, and that his (said Kosciuszko\'s) parents were living in Poland at the date of the first of said letters."</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Exhibit A</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"Monticello, June 12, 1818"</p>\n<p>"Sir, I have received your favor of May 27 on the subject of the property of the late General Kosciuszko, vested in our funds and left under my care and direction.  A little before the departure of the General from America in 1798, he wrote a will, all with his own hand, in which he directed, that the property he should possess here at the time of his death should be laid out in the purchase of young negroes, who were to be educated and emancipated; of this will he named me executor and deposited it in my hands.  The interest of his money was to be regularly remitted to him in Europe.  My situation in the interior of the country rendered it impossible for me to act personally in the remittances of his funds, and Mr. John Barnes, therefore, of Georgetown, was engaged under a power of attorney to do that on commission, which duty he regularly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 33 U. S. 64</a></p><p> and faithfully performed until we heard of the death of the General.  We had, in the meantime, by seasonably withdrawing the greater part of his funds from the bank in which he had deposited them and lending them to the government during the late war, augmented them to $17,150.63 -- to-wit, $12,499.63 in the funds of the United States and $4,600 in the Bank of Columbia, in Georgetown."</p>\n<p>"I delayed for a considerable time the regular probate of the will, expecting to hear from Europe whether he had left any will there which might affect his property here.  I thought that prudence and safety required this, although the last letter he wrote me before his death, dated September 15, 1817, assured me of the contrary in these words,"</p>\n<p>"nous avancons tous en age, c\'est pour cela, mon cher et respectable ami, que je vous prie de vouloir bien (et comme vous avez tout le pouvoir) arranger qu\'apre la mort de notre digne ami Mr. Barnes, quelqu\'un d\'aussi probe que lui prenne sa place, pour que je recoive les interets ponctuellement de mon fonds; duquel, apres ma mort, <em>vous savez la destination invariable,</em> quant a present faites pour le mieux comme vous pensez."</p>\n<p>"After his death, a claim was presented to me on behalf of Kosciuszko Armstrong, son of General Armstrong, of $3,704, given in Kosciuszko\'s lifetime, payable out of this fund, and subsequently came a claim to the whole from Mr. Zeltner, of Soleure, under a will made there.  I proceeded, on the advice of the Attorney General of the United States, to prove the will in the state court of the district in which I reside, but declined the executorship.  When the General named me his executor, I was young enough to undertake the duty, although from its nature it was like to be of long continuance, but the lapse of twenty years more had rendered it imprudent for me to engage in what I could not live to carry into effect; finding now by your letter of May 27 that a relation of the General\'s also claims this property, that it is likely to become litigious, and age and incompetence to business admonishing me to withdraw myself from entanglements of that kind, I have determined to deliver the will and whole subject over to such court of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 33 U. S. 65</a></p><p> United States as the Attorney General of the United States shall advise (probably it will be that of the District of Columbia) to place the case in his hands, and to petition that court to relieve me from it, and to appoint an administrator with the will annexed.  Such an administrator will probably call on the different claimants to interplead and let the court decide what shall be done with the property.

Lear, 33 U.S. 8 Pet. 52 52 (1834)</h3><p><b>Armstrong v. Lear</b></p><p><b>33 U.S. (8 Pet.) 52</b></p><p><b></b></p><p><em>APPEAL FROM THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE UNITED STATES OF\n</em></p>\n<p><em>THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA FOR THE COUNTY OF WASHINGTON\n</em></p>\n<p><em><em>Syllabus</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>A bill was filed in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia claiming a legacy under an alleged codicil made in Paris to a will made in the United States.  The testator was a native of Poland; at the time of the making of the codicil he resided in France, and when be made the will to which the instrument upon which the legacy was claimed was said to be a codicil, he was in the United</p>\n<p>states.  He went to Europe soon after he made the will, and many years afterwards he died in Switzerland.  The bill alleged that the instrument on which the legacy was claimed had been duly proved in the Orphans\' Court of Washington County in the District of Columbia, where the administrator with the will annexed resided.  There was no allegation that the codicil had been established to be a valid will by the law of France, the place of the domicile of the testator where the same was made.  The administrator submitted to the court whether it would decree the payment of the money to the complainant</p>\n<p>"upon an instrument made under the circumstances and authenticated in the manner that the aforesaid instrument is, and whether the said instrument shall have effect to revoke or alter any part of said testators will, solemnly executed and left in the hands of his executor in this country,"</p>\n<p>&amp;c.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"This is certainly a very informal and loose mode of putting in issue (if upon the bill such a question can be tried) the validity of a will made in a foreign country whose laws are not brought before the court either by averment or evidence."</p>\n<p>The answer contains an allegation that certain persons residing in Europe have filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia against him, the administrator, claiming a large portion of the assets, if not the whole, as creditors or mortgagees of the testator, and certain persons, also residing in Europe, have filed another bill against him (it was probably meant in the same court) claiming the whole assets as heirs at law of the testator, and therefore as distributees of the said assets.  None of the parties to either of these latter bills is made party to the present bill.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"The persons claiming as heirs of the testator should be made parties, that they may have an opportunity to test the plaintiffs title as the real parties in interest, the administrator being but a mere stockholder."</p>\n<p>The heirs and legal representatives of the testator filed a bill in the circuit court claiming from the administrator of the testator with the will annexed the funds which had come into his hands, which bill is still pending.  The allegations in the bill go to defeat the validity of the will made in the United states, and also assert other grounds of claim.</p>\n<p>By the Court:</p>\n<p>"All the bills ought, if possible, to be brought to a hearing at the same time in the circuit court in order that a final disposition may at the same time be made of all the questions arising in all of them."</p>\n<p>If the intention is to put in issue (as it seems to be) not only the construction and operation of the testamentary instrument in favor of the plaintiff, but its validity and effect as a will, it is material that the law of France, the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="53">Page 33 U. S. 53</a></p><p> place of the domicile of the testator at the time of its execution should be brought before the court and established as matter of fact, for the court cannot judicially take notice of foreign laws, but they must be proved by proper evidence.  The present allegations of the bill and answer are quite too loose for this purpose, and they should be amended and made more distinct and direct.</p>\n<p>There may arise some nice questions of international law in which the fact of the domicile of the testator at the time of his birth, at the time of his making the will made in the United States, and at the time of his death may become material.  The Court does not mean to say what is the rule that is to govern in cases of wills of personalty, whether it be the rule of the native domicile or of the domicile at the time of the execution of the will or of the domicile at the death of the party where there have been changes of domicile.  These are points which ought, under the circumstances of this case, to be left open for argument.  But the facts on which the argument should rest ought to be distinctly averred in the bill and met in the answer.</p>\n<p>The place of domicile of the testator at the time of his death may also become material under another aspect of the case, <em>viz.,</em>  the question who are his heirs, entitled to the succession, <em>ab intestato,</em> or under the other will or wills executed by him, to which reference is made in some of the papers in the case.  The persons claiming as such heirs must establish their title under and according to the law of his domicile at the time of his death.  So that perhaps it may become material, if Switzerland was the domicile of the testator at the time of his death, to bring the law of that country distinctly, as matter of fact, before the court.</p>\n<p>On 1 April, 1829, the appellant Kosciuszko Armstrong filed a bill in the circuit court setting forth his citizenship of the State of New York and that Thade Kosciuszko, late an officer in the service of the United States in the war of their Revolution and of the Republic of Poland, on or about 5 May in the year 1798, placed a large sum in the hands of Thomas Jefferson, Esq., late President of the United States, far exceeding the sum of $10,000, and executed a will and testament, a copy of which is herewith filed and marked exhibit A, and which this complainant prays may be taken as a part of this his bill.  That afterwards, to-wit on or about 28 June in the year 1806, the said Thade Kosciuszko, being then domiciled at Paris, in the Kingdom of France, executed a certain instrument of writing, being in the nature and of the effect of a last will or writing testamentary, whereby he willed and directed that at his decease the sum of $3,704 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="54">Page 33 U. S. 54</a></p><p> current money should be possessed by and delivered over to the full enjoyment and use of the complainant, and the said testator thereby instructed and authorized his only lawful executor in the United States, the said Thomas Jefferson, to reserve, in trust for that special purpose, of the funds he held belonging to the testator, the aforesaid sum of $3,704 in principal to the complainant, to be paid by him, the said Thomas Jefferson, immediately after his decease, to the complainant, and, in case of his death, to the use and benefit of his surviving brothers.  That the said testator, on the day and year aforesaid, duly signed and sealed the said instrument of writing in the presence of two competent witnesses, who attested the same, and acknowledged the same on the same day before Fulwar Skipwith, commercial agent and agent for prize causes for the said United States at Paris, and then delivered the same under his hand and seal to John Armstrong, father of the complainant.  That afterwards, to-wit on 15 October in the year 1817, the said Thade Kosciuszko departed this life, leaving the said instrument of writing unrevoked, and the same was, after the death of the said Thade Kosciuszko, admitted to probate and duly proved in the Orphan\'s Court of Washington County, a copy whereof, exhibit B, he prays may be taken as a part of his bill.</p>\n<p>That he is advised and believes that the said instrument of writing is, to all intents and purposes, a last will and testament, and must operate as such, and revokes <em>pro tanto</em> the bequests and appropriation made in the will first mentioned; that the said Thomas Jefferson, named as executor in the will first mentioned, refused to take out letters testamentary on the estate of the said Thade Kosciuszko and renounced all claim and right so to do, according to law, and Benjamin L. Lear, whom the complainant prays may be made defendant to this his bill, was duly appointed administrator with the will annexed on the said estate, which has since come into the hands of the said Benjamin L. Lear, far exceeding, as aforesaid, $10,000.  That the said Benjamin L. Lear has been frequently applied to by the complainant for the payment of the aforementioned legacy of $3,704, together with the interest thereon, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="55">Page 33 U. S. 55</a></p><p> which the said Lear refuses to pay until the order and decree of this Court had upon the premises, and the said defendant combining and confederating with one Major Estho, a subject of his Imperial Majesty, the Emperor of all the Russias, and Monsieur Zeltner, formerly minister plenipotentiary of the Helvetic Republic at Paris, and now residing at Soleure in Switzerland, whom the complainant prays may be made parties to this his bill of complaint; the said confederates sometimes pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko never executed the said the last mentioned writing testamentary, and sometimes they pretend that the said Major Estho is the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, and as such entitled to all his said estate; and sometimes they pretend that the said Thade Kosciuszko, during his lifetime, made some disposition of his said estate in favor of the children and other relatives of the said Zeltner, whereas the said last-mentioned writing testamentary was duly executed as aforesaid, and that the said Major Estho is not the heir at law of the said Thade Kosciuszko, or if he is that he is not entitled to receive distribution of the said personal estate, and that the said Thade Kosciuszko made no testamentary or other disposition in favor of the said Zeltner or his children or relatives which could affect the claim of the complainant under the said writing testamentary.

And this defendant saith that he was, on 14 August in the year 1821, appointed by the Orphan\'s Court of the County of Washington, District of Columbia, the administrator with the will annexed of the estate of the said general Thaddeus Kosciuszko, and received from the said orphan\'s court letters of administration with said will annexed, a copy of which is herewith exhibited to this Court, marked defendant\'s exhibit C, and which this defendant prays may be taken as part of this his answer."</p>\n<p>"That after receiving said letters of administration, there came to the hands of this defendant from the said Thomas Jefferson, as the estate of said Kosciuszko, two certificates of the six percent stock of the United States -- one of $11,363.63 and the other of $1,136.36, and one certificate of stock of the Bank of Columbia of forty-six shares, amounting, at their par value, to $4,600.  That the appraisers appointed by the aforesaid orphan\'s court to estimate the value of said stocks, appraised them both at par, taking into consideration the advance of the market price of the one, and the depreciation of that of the other, and their respective amounts, and appraising them both together."</p>\n<p>"That after the receipts of said certificates, there came to the hands of this defendant dividends upon said stocks to the amount of $$,104, which he invested, with the consent of said orphan\'s court, in six percent stocks of the said United States, and which purchased of said stock of the United States a certificate of $3,794.24, and that there have since come to his hands, as dividends upon all of said stocks, $580.82, making the whole amount of the estate of said Kosciuszko, which has came to his hands, $20,894.23 of stocks, estimated at their par value, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="63">Page 33 U.

This defendant, further answering to the bill of said complainant, saith that among the papers which came to his hands as hereinbefore mentioned is a letter from the aforesaid Mr. De Poletica to the said Thomas Jefferson enclosing a copy of a dispatch from the Viceroy of Poland to him, a copy of which letter and dispatch is herewith exhibited to this honorable court, marked defendant\'s exhibit D, and by which this defendant understands that the whole estate of said Kosciuszko may be claimed by a Major Estho, of Poland, as the heir at law of said Kosciuszko."</p>\n<p>"That this respondent communicated to said Poletica in April last such information as he possessed in relation to said estate, and was informed by said Politica that the same would be transmitted to the said Viceroy of Poland.  That there was also, among the papers aforesaid, two letters from a Mr. Zeltner to said Thomas Jefferson, copies of which are herewith exhibited, marked \'defendant\'s exhibit E,\' and \'defendant\'s exhibit F,\' by which this defendant understands that the said Kosciuszko has disposed of the greater part of his fortune in favor of the children, nieces, brothers, and sister of the said Zeltner, and that his (said Kosciuszko\'s) parents were living in Poland at the date of the first of said letters."</p>\n<p>"<em><em>Exhibit A</em>" </em></p>\n<p>"Monticello, June 12, 1818"</p>\n<p>"Sir, I have received your favor of May 27 on the subject of the property of the late General Kosciuszko, vested in our funds and left under my care and direction.  A little before the departure of the General from America in 1798, he wrote a will, all with his own hand, in which he directed, that the property he should possess here at the time of his death should be laid out in the purchase of young negroes, who were to be educated and emancipated; of this will he named me executor and deposited it in my hands.  The interest of his money was to be regularly remitted to him in Europe.  My situation in the interior of the country rendered it impossible for me to act personally in the remittances of his funds, and Mr. John Barnes, therefore, of Georgetown, was engaged under a power of attorney to do that on commission, which duty he regularly </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 33 U. S. 64</a></p><p> and faithfully performed until we heard of the death of the General.  We had, in the meantime, by seasonably withdrawing the greater part of his funds from the bank in which he had deposited them and lending them to the government during the late war, augmented them to $17,150.63 -- to-wit, $12,499.63 in the funds of the United States and $4,600 in the Bank of Columbia, in Georgetown."</p>\n<p>"I delayed for a considerable time the regular probate of the will, expecting to hear from Europe whether he had left any will there which might affect his property here.  I thought that prudence and safety required this, although the last letter he wrote me before his death, dated September 15, 1817, assured me of the contrary in these words,"</p>\n<p>"nous avancons tous en age, c\'est pour cela, mon cher et respectable ami, que je vous prie de vouloir bien (et comme vous avez tout le pouvoir) arranger qu\'apre la mort de notre digne ami Mr. Barnes, quelqu\'un d\'aussi probe que lui prenne sa place, pour que je recoive les interets ponctuellement de mon fonds; duquel, apres ma mort, <em>vous savez la destination invariable,</em> quant a present faites pour le mieux comme vous pensez."</p>\n<p>"After his death, a claim was presented to me on behalf of Kosciuszko Armstrong, son of General Armstrong, of $3,704, given in Kosciuszko\'s lifetime, payable out of this fund, and subsequently came a claim to the whole from Mr. Zeltner, of Soleure, under a will made there.  I proceeded, on the advice of the Attorney General of the United States, to prove the will in the state court of the district in which I reside, but declined the executorship.  When the General named me his executor, I was young enough to undertake the duty, although from its nature it was like to be of long continuance, but the lapse of twenty years more had rendered it imprudent for me to engage in what I could not live to carry into effect; finding now by your letter of May 27 that a relation of the General\'s also claims this property, that it is likely to become litigious, and age and incompetence to business admonishing me to withdraw myself from entanglements of that kind, I have determined to deliver the will and whole subject over to such court of the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 33 U. S. 65</a></p><p> United States as the Attorney General of the United States shall advise (probably it will be that of the District of Columbia) to place the case in his hands, and to petition that court to relieve me from it, and to appoint an administrator with the will annexed.  Such an administrator will probably call on the different claimants to interplead and let the court decide what shall be done with the property.  This I shall do, sir, with as little delay as the necessary consultations will admit, and when the administrator is appointed, I shall deliver to him the original certificates which are in my possession; the accumulating interest and dividends remain untouched in the Treasury of the United States and Bank of Columbia."</p>\n<p>"I learnt with much pleasure your return to the United States, and in a character which enables you to do much good to your own as well as to our country.  The peace and friendly intercourse of nations depend much on the personal characters of their diplomatic agents, whose view of things, in black or in white, cannot fail to tinge that of their respective governments.  Your friendly dispositions give us entire confidence that everything from you will be conciliatory, and its effects the greater as the proofs we have had of the friendship of your great and good emperor give us confidence that whatever seed you sow will fall \'neither by the wayside nor in stony places, nor among thorns, but on good ground, which will bring forth fruit to a hundredfold.\'"</p>\n<p>"We all recollect with pleasure the favor of your former visit to Monticello, and a repetition will be equally gratifying should your affairs permit.

The bill, however, does assert that the instrument is a last will and testament, to all intents and purposes, and must operate as such, and revoke <em>pro tanto</em> the bequests and appropriation in the prior will, of which Mr. Jefferson was named executor.</p>\n<p>The answer of the administrator (Lear) is substantially the same as his former answer, admitting the execution of the instrument but submitting to the court (without denying in a formal and direct manner the validity of the will as such, according to the law of France) whether it will decree the defendant to pay the money to the plaintiff</p>\n<p>"upon an instrument made under the circumstances, and authenticated in the manner that the aforesaid instrument is, and whether the said instrument shall have effect to revoke or alter any part of said Kosciuszko\'s will, solemnly executed and left in the hands of his executor in this county,"</p>\n<p>&amp;c.  This is certainly a very informal and loose mode of putting in issue, if upon the bill such a question can be tried, the validity of a will made in a foreign country whose laws are not brought before the court either by averment or evidence.  But the answer contains a new allegation that certain persons residing in Europe have filed a bill in the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia against him, the administrator, claiming a large portion of the assets, if not the whole, as creditors or mortgagees of the said Kosciuzko, and certain persons, also residing in Europe, have filed another bill against him (it was probably meant in the same court) claiming the whole assets as heirs at law of the said Kosciuszko, and therefore as distributees of the said assets.  None of the parties to either of these latter bills is made party to the present bill.  And we are of opinion that the persons claiming as heirs of Kosciuszko, should be made parties, that they may have an opportunity to contest the plaintiff\'s title, as the real parties in interest, the administrator being but a mere stake holder.  Indeed, we think that all three of the bills ought (if possible) to be brought to a hearing at the same time in the circuit court in order that a final disposition may at the same time be made of all of the questions arising in all of them.</p>\n<p>We wish also to attract the attention of counsel to some other considerations which may become important in future </p><p><a class="page-number" name="73">Page 33 U. S. 73</a></p><p> stages of the cause, and especially in the aspect under which the present bill and answer are framed.  In the first place, if the intention is to put in issue (as it seems to be) not only the construction and operation of the testamentary instrument in favor of the plaintiff, but its validity and effect as a will, it is material that the law of France, the place of the domicile of Kosciuszko at the time of its execution, should be brought before the court and established as matter of fact, for the court cannot judicially take notice of foreign laws, but they must be proved by proper evidence.  The present allegations of the bill and answer are quite too loose for this purpose, and they should be amended, and made more distinct and direct.  We do not mean to express any opinion whether this Court can examine into the point of the validity of the instrument as a will according to the law of France, or whether it belongs exclusively to the Orphan\'s Court of the County of Washington.  That is a question which it may be fit hereafter to examine if it should be pressed in argument.</p>\n<p>In the next place, there may arise some nice questions of international law in which the fact of the domicile of Kosciuszko at the time of his birth, at the time of his making the will of which Mr. Jefferson was named executor, and at the time of his death, may become material.  We do not mean to say what is the true rule that is to govern in cases of wills of personalty, whether it be the rule of the native domicile, or of the domicile at the time of the execution of the will, or of the domicile at the death of the party, where there have been changes of domicile.  These are points which ought, under the circumstances of this case, to be left open for argument.  But the facts on which the argument should rest ought to be distinctly averred in the bill, and met in the answer.</p>\n<p>The place of domicile of Kosciuszko at the time of his death may also become material under another aspect of the case, <em>viz.,</em> the question, who are his heirs, entitled to the succession <em>ab intestato,</em> or under the other will or wills executed by him, to which reference is made in some of the papers in the case.  The persons claiming as such heirs must establish their title under and according to the law of his domicile at the time of his death.  So that perhaps it may become material, if Switzerland was the domicile of Kosciuszko at the time of his death, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="74">Page 33 U. S. 74</a></p><p> to bring the law of that country distinctly, as matter of fact, before the court.  The court has, in another case, <em>Estho v. Lear,</em> 7 Pet. 130, expressed its desire to have the other will or wills made by Kosciuszko put regularly upon the record to ascertain whether they have any bearing upon the merits of the present case.</p>\n<p>It is also material to observe that the answer of the administrator relies on a letter written by Kosciuszko to Mr. Jefferson in September, 1817, as a revocation of the supposed testamentary paper in favor of Armstrong and a republication of the first will, and yet that letter is not produced in evidence nor even the extract verified, so that there is a total deficiency of proof as to this most material fact.  This defect ought to be supplied.</p>\n<p>These observations have been thought fit by the Court to be suggested to the counsel on both sides on the present occasion.  Under the complicated circumstances of the present case and the important bearings of foreign law upon it, it is very desirable that if it should come again before us, all the facts and all the lights necessary for a final decision may be furnished without submitting it to further embarrassments.</p>\n<p>The Court decrees that the decree of the circuit court dismissing the bill be</p>\n<p><em>Reversed, and that the cause be remanded with leave to make new parties and for other proceedings.</em></p>\n<p>This cause came on to be heard on the transcript of the record from the Circuit Court of the United States for the District of Columbia holden in and for the County of Washington, and was argued by counsel, on consideration whereof it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed by this Court that the decree of the said circuit court dismissing the bill in this cause be and the same is hereby reversed, and that this cause be and the same is hereby remanded to the said circuit court with leave to make new parties and for other proceedings to be had therein according to law and justice and in conformity to the opinion of this Court.</p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
