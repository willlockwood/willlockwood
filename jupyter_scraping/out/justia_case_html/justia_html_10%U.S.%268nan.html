S. 272</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>On the principal question in this case the Court can entertain no doubt.  On the capture of the <em>Minerva,</em> the right to abandon was complete, and this right was exercised during her detention.</p>\n<p>The objections to the form of the abandonment are not deemed substantial.  The agent who made the insurance might certainly be credited, and, in transactions of this kind, always is credited, when he declares that, by the order of his principal, he abandons to the underwriters.  In this case, the jury find that the abandonment was made for the plaintiff, and this finding establishes that fact.</p>\n<p>The informality of the deed of cession is thought unimportant because, if the abandonment was unexceptionable, the property vested immediately in the underwriters and the deed was not essential to the right of either party.  Had it been demanded and refused, that circumstance might have altered the law of the case.</p>\n<p>If the abandonment was legal, it put the underwriters completely in the place of the assured, and Parker became their agent.  When he contracts on behalf of the owners of the goods, he contracts on behalf of the underwriters, who have become owners, not on behalf of Stark, who has ceased to be one.  His act is no longer the act of Stark, and is not to be considered as an interference on his part which may affect the abandonment.  If any particular instructions had been given on this subject, if any act of ownership had been exerted by Stark himself, such conduct might be construed into a relinquishment of an abandonment which had not been accepted; but as nothing of the kind exists, the act of the supercargo is to be considered as the act of the persons interested, whoever they may be. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="273">Page 10 U. S. 273</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The only point which presents any difficulty in the opinion of the Court is the objection founded on the omission in the verdict to find that the abandonment was made in reasonable time.</p>\n<p>The law is settled that an abandonment, to be effectual, must be made in reasonable time, but what time is reasonable is a question compounded of fact and law which has not yet been reduced to such certainty as to enable the court to pronounce upon it without the aid of a jury.  Certainly the delay may be so great as to enable every man to declare without hesitation that it is unreasonable, or the abandonment may be so immediate that all will admit it to have been made in reasonable time; but there may be such a medium between these extremes as to render it doubtful whether the delay has been reasonable or otherwise.  If it was a mere question of law which the court might decide, then the law would determine, to a day or an hour, on the time left for deliberation after receiving notice of the loss.  But the law has not so determined, and it therefore remains a question compounded of fact and law, which must be found by a jury under the direction of the court.</p>\n<p>In this case, the jury has found an abandonment, but has not found whether it was made in due time or otherwise.  The fact is therefore found defectively, and for that reason a <em>venire facias de novo</em> must be awarded.</p>\n<p>It may not be amiss to remark that the judicial opinions which we generally find in the books on these subjects are usually given by way of instruction to the jury or on a motion for a new trial, not on special verdicts.  The distinction between the cases deserves consideration.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment reversed and the cause remanded with direction to award a venire facias de novo.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
