HAUGEN<br/>\n543 U. S. ____ (2004)<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ROCHELLE BROSSEAU <em>v.</em> KENNETH J. HAUGEN</p>\n<p align="left">on petition for writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the ninth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 03\xe2\x80\x931261.Decided December 13, 2004</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Per Curiam.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Officer Rochelle Brosseau, a member of the Puyallup, Washington, Police Department, shot Kenneth Haugen in the back as he attempted to flee from law enforcement authorities in his vehicle.  Haugen subsequently filed this action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington pursuant to Rev. Stat. \xc2\xa71979, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983.  He alleged that the shot fired by Brosseau constituted excessive force and violated his federal constitutional rights.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  The District Court granted summary judgment to Brosseau after finding she was entitled to qualified immunity.  The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed.  339 F.\xc2\xa03d 857 (2003).  Following the two-step process set out in <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>,<em> </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/533/194/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/194/index.html"></a><a href="/us/533/194/index.html">533 U. S. 194</a> (2001), the Court of Appeals found, first, that Brosseau had violated Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment right to be free from excessive force and, second, that the right violated was clearly established and thus Brosseau was not entitled to qualified immunity.  Brosseau then petitioned for writ of certiorari, requesting that we review both of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 determinations.  We grant the petition on the second, qualified immunity question and reverse.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The material facts, construed in a light most favorable to Haugen, are as follows.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  On the day before the fracas, Glen Tamburello went to the police station and reported to Brosseau that Haugen, a former crime partner of his, had stolen tools from his shop.  Brosseau later learned that there was a felony no-bail warrant out for Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s arrest on drug and other offenses.  The next morning, Haugen was spray-painting his Jeep Cherokee in his mother\xe2\x80\x99s driveway.  Tamburello learned of Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s whereabouts, and he and cohort Matt Atwood drove a pickup truck to Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s house to pay Haugen a visit.  A fight ensued, which was witnessed by a neighbor who called 911.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brosseau heard a report that the men were fighting in Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s yard and responded.  When she arrived, Tamburello and Atwood were attempting to get Haugen into Tamburello\xe2\x80\x99s pickup.  Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s arrival created a distraction, which provided Haugen the opportunity to get away.  Haugen ran through his mother\xe2\x80\x99s yard and hid in the neighborhood.  Brosseau requested assistance, and, shortly thereafter, two officers arrived with a K\xe2\x80\x939 to help track Haugen down.  During the search, which lasted about 30 to 45 minutes, officers instructed Tamburello and Atwood to remain in Tamburello\xe2\x80\x99s pickup.  They instructed Deanna Nocera, Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend who was also present with her 3-year-old daughter, to remain in her small car with her daughter.  Tamburello\xe2\x80\x99s pickup was parked in the street in front of the driveway; Nocera\xe2\x80\x99s small car was parked in the driveway in front of and facing the Jeep; and the Jeep was in the driveway facing Nocera\xe2\x80\x99s car and angled somewhat to the left.  The Jeep was parked about 4 feet away from Nocera\xe2\x80\x99s car and 20 to 30 feet away from Tamburello\xe2\x80\x99s pickup.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An officer radioed from down the street that a neighbor had seen a man in her backyard.  Brosseau ran in that direction, and Haugen appeared.  He ran past the front of his mother\xe2\x80\x99s house and then turned and ran into the driveway.  With Brosseau still in pursuit, he jumped into the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side of the Jeep and closed and locked the door.  Brosseau believed that he was running to the Jeep to retrieve a weapon.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Brosseau arrived at the Jeep, pointed her gun at Haugen, and ordered him to get out of the vehicle.  Haugen ignored her command and continued to look for the keys so he could get the Jeep started.  Brosseau repeated her commands and hit the driver\xe2\x80\x99s side window several times with her handgun, which failed to deter Haugen.  On the third or fourth try, the window shattered.  Brosseau unsuccessfully attempted to grab the keys and struck Haugen on the head with the barrel and butt of her gun.  Haugen, still undeterred, succeeded in starting the Jeep.  As the Jeep started or shortly after it began to move, Brosseau jumped back and to the left.  She fired one shot through the rear driver\xe2\x80\x99s side window at a forward angle, hitting Haugen in the back.  She later explained that she shot Haugen because she was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fearful for the other officers on foot who [she] believed were in the immediate area, [and] for the occupied vehicles in [Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s] path and for any other citizens who might be in the area.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  339 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 865.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Despite being hit, Haugen, in his words, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98st[ood] on the gas\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; navigated the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98small, tight space\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to avoid the other vehicles; swerved across the neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s lawn; and continued down the street.  <em>Id.,</em> at 882.  After about a half block, Haugen realized that he had been shot and brought the Jeep to a halt.  He suffered a collapsed lung and was airlifted to a hospital.  He survived the shooting and subsequently pleaded guilty to the felony of \xe2\x80\x9celuding.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wash. Rev. Code \xc2\xa746.61.024 (1994).  By so pleading, he admitted that he drove his Jeep in a manner indicating \xe2\x80\x9ca wanton or wilful disregard for the lives . . . of others.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  He subsequently brought this \xc2\xa71983 action against Brosseau.</p>\n<p align="left">***</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When confronted with a claim of qualified immunity, a court must ask first the following question: \xe2\x80\x9cTaken in the light most favorable to the party asserting the injury, do the facts alleged show the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated a constitutional right?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, 533 U. S., at 201.  As the Court of Appeals recognized, the constitutional question in this case is governed by the principles enunciated in <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a> (1985), and <em>Graham</em> v. <em>Connor</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/386/index.html">490 U. S. 386</a> (1989).  These cases establish that claims of excessive force are to be judged under the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98objective reasonableness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d standard.  <em>Id.,</em> at 388.  Specifically with regard to deadly force, we explained in <em>Garner</em> that it is unreasonable for an officer to \xe2\x80\x9cseize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead.\xe2\x80\x9d  471 U. S., at 11.  But \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We express no view as to the correctness of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision on the constitutional question itself.  We believe that, however that question is decided, the Court of Appeals was wrong on the issue of qualified immunity.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Qualified immunity shields an officer from suit when she makes a decision that, even if constitutionally deficient, reasonably misapprehends the law governing the circumstances she confronted.  <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz</em>, 533 U. S.,<em> </em>at 206 (qualified immunity operates \xe2\x80\x9cto protect officers from the sometimes \xe2\x80\x98hazy border between excessive and acceptable force\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Because the focus is on whether the officer had fair notice that her conduct was unlawful, reasonableness is judged against the backdrop of the law at the time of the conduct.  If the law at that time did not clearly establish that the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct would violate the Constitution, the officer should not be subject to liability or, indeed, even the burdens of litigation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is important to emphasize that this inquiry \xe2\x80\x9cmust be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 201.  As we previously said in this very context:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9c[T]here is no doubt that <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Connor</em>, <em>supra</em>, clearly establishes the general proposition that use of force is contrary to the Fourth Amendment if it is excessive under objective standards of reasonableness.  Yet that is not enough.  Rather, we emphasized in <em>Anderson </em>[v.<em> Creighton,</em>] \xe2\x80\x98that the right the official is alleged to have violated must have been \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d in a more particularized, and hence more relevant, sense: The contours of the right must be sufficiently clear that a reasonable official would understand that what he is doing violates that right.\xe2\x80\x99  483 U. S. [635,] 640 [(1987)].  The relevant, dispositive inquiry in determining whether a right is clearly established is whether it would be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 201\xe2\x80\x93202.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals acknowledged this statement of law, but then proceeded to find fair warning in the general tests set out in <em>Graham</em> and <em>Garner</em>.  339 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 873\xe2\x80\x93874.  In so doing, it was mistaken.  <em>Graham</em> and <em>Garner</em>, following the lead of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s text, are cast at a high level of generality.  See <em>Graham </em>v. <em>Connor</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 396 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[T]he test of reasonableness under the Fourth Amendment is not capable of precise definition or mechanical application\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Of course, in an obvious case, these standards can \xe2\x80\x9cclearly establish\xe2\x80\x9d the answer, even without a body of relevant case law.  See <em>Hope </em>v. <em>Pelzer</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a>, 738 (2002) (noting in a case where the Eighth Amendment violation was \xe2\x80\x9cobvious\xe2\x80\x9d that there need not be a materially similar case for the right to be clearly established).  See also <em>Pace</em> v. <em>Capobianco</em>, 283 F.\xc2\xa03d 1275, 1283 (CA11 2002) (explaining in a Fourth Amendment case involving an officer shooting a fleeing suspect in a vehicle that, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we look at decisions such as <em>Garner</em> and <em>Graham</em>, we see some tests to guide us in determining the law in many different kinds of circumstances; but we do not see the kind of clear law (clear answers) that would apply\xe2\x80\x9d to the situation at hand).  The present case is far from the obvious one where <em>Graham</em> and <em>Garner</em> alone offer a basis for decision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We therefore turn to ask whether, at the time of Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s actions, it was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cclearly established\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in this more \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98particularized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d sense that she was violating Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment right.  <em>Saucier</em> v. <em>Katz</em>, 533 U. S., at 202.  The parties point us to only a handful of cases relevant to the \xe2\x80\x9csituation [Brosseau] confronted\xe2\x80\x9d: whether to shoot a disturbed felon, set on avoiding capture through vehicular flight, when persons in the immediate area are at risk from that flight.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  <em>Ibid</em>.  Specifically, Brosseau points us to <em>Cole</em> v. <em>Bone</em>, 993 F.\xc2\xa02d 1328 (CA8 1993), and <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Freland</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d 343 (CA6 1992).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these cases, the courts found no Fourth Amendment violation when an officer shot a fleeing suspect who presented a risk to others.  <em>Cole </em>v. <em>Bone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1333 (holding the officer \xe2\x80\x9chad probable cause to believe that the truck posed an imminent threat of serious physical harm to innocent motorists as well as to the officers themselves\xe2\x80\x9d);<em> Smith</em> v. <em>Freland</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d, at 347 (noting \xe2\x80\x9ca car can be a deadly weapon\xe2\x80\x9d and holding the officer\xe2\x80\x99s decision to stop the car from possibly injuring others was reasonable).  <em>Smith</em> is closer to this case.  There, the officer and suspect engaged in a car chase, which appeared to be at an end when the officer cornered the suspect at the back of a dead-end residential street.  The suspect, however, freed his car and began speeding down the street.  At this point, the officer fired a shot, which killed the suspect.  The court held the officer\xe2\x80\x99s decision was reasonable and thus did not violate the Fourth Amendment.  It noted that the suspect, like Haugen here, \xe2\x80\x9chad proven he would do almost anything to avoid capture\xe2\x80\x9d and that he posed a major threat to, among others, the officers at the end of the street.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Haugen points us to <em>Estate of Starks</em> v. <em>Enyart</em>, 5 F.\xc2\xa03d 230 (CA7 1993), where the court found summary judgment inappropriate on a Fourth Amendment claim involving a fleeing suspect.  There, the court concluded that the threat created by the fleeing suspect\xe2\x80\x99s failure to brake when an officer suddenly stepped in front of his just-started car was not a sufficiently grave threat to justify the use of deadly force.  <em>Id.</em>, at 234.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0These three cases taken together undoubtedly show that this area is one in which the result depends very much on the facts of each case.  None of them squarely governs the case here; they do suggest that Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s actions fell in the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98hazy border between excessive and acceptable force.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Saucier </em>v. <em>Katz</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 206.  The cases by no means \xe2\x80\x9cclearly establish\xe2\x80\x9d that Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Haugen also asserted pendent state-law claims and claims against the city and police department.

As the Court notes, <em>ante</em>, at ___, (slip op., at 4), <em>Saucier</em> requires lower courts to decide (1) the constitutional question prior to deciding (2) the qualified immunity question.  I am concerned that the current rule rigidly requires courts unnecessarily to decide difficult constitutional questions when there is available an easier basis for the decision (<em>e.g., </em>qualified immunity) that will satisfactorily resolve the case before the court.  Indeed when courts\xe2\x80\x99 dockets are crowded, a rigid \xe2\x80\x9corder of battle\xe2\x80\x9d makes little administrative sense and can sometimes lead to a constitutional decision that is effectively insulated from review, see <em>Bunting</em> v. <em>Mellen</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/1019/index.html">541 U.

What is not clear is whether Brosseau is nonetheless entitled to qualified immunity because it might not have been apparent to a reasonably well trained officer in Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s shoes that killing Haugen to prevent his escape was unconstitutional.  In my opinion that question should be answered by a jury.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Law enforcement officers should never be subject to damages liability for failing to anticipate novel developments in constitutional law.  Accordingly, whenever a suit against an officer is based on the alleged violation of a constitutional right that has not been clearly established, the qualified immunity defense is available.  <em>Harlow</em> v. <em>Fitzgerald,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/800/index.html">457 U.

The constitutional limits on the use of deadly force have been clearly established for almost two decades.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1985, we held that the killing of an unarmed burglar to prevent his escape was an unconstitutional seizure.  <em>Tennessee</em> v. <em>Garner,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/471/1/index.html">471 U. S. 1</a>.  We considered, and rejected, the State\xe2\x80\x99s contention that the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against unreasonable seizures should be construed in light of the common-law rule, which allowed the use of whatever force was necessary to effectuate the arrest of a fleeing felon.  <em>Id.,</em> at 12\xe2\x80\x9313.  We recognized that the common-law rule had been fashioned \xe2\x80\x9cwhen virtually all felonies were punishable by death\xe2\x80\x9d and long before guns were available to the police, and noted that modern police departments in a majority of large cities allowed the firing of a weapon only when a felon presented a threat of death or serious bodily harm.  <em>Id.,</em> at 13\xe2\x80\x9319.  We concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cchanges in the legal and technological context\xe2\x80\x9d had made the old rule obsolete.  <em>Id.,</em> at 15.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Unlike most \xe2\x80\x9cexcessive force\xe2\x80\x9d cases in which the degree of permissible force varies widely from case to case, the only issue in a \xe2\x80\x9cdeadly force\xe2\x80\x9d case is whether the facts apparent to the officer justify a decision to kill a suspect in order to prevent his escape.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Garner</em> we stated the governing rule:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe use of deadly force to prevent the escape of all felony suspects, whatever the circumstances, is constitutionally unreasonable.  It is not better that all felony suspects die than that they escape.  Where the suspect poses no immediate threat to the officer and no threat to others, the harm resulting from failure to apprehend him does not justify the use of deadly force to do so\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. A police officer may not seize an unarmed, nondangerous suspect by shooting him dead\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the officer has probable cause to believe that the suspect poses a threat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others, it is not constitutionally unreasonable to prevent escape by using deadly force.  Thus, if the suspect threatens the officer with a weapon or there is probable cause to believe that he has committed a crime involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious physical harm, deadly force may be used if necessary to prevent escape, and if, where feasible, some warning has been given.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The most common justifications for the use of deadly force are plainly inapplicable to this case.  Respondent Haugen had not threatened anyone with a weapon, and petitioner Brosseau did not shoot in order to defend herself.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Haugen was not a person who had committed a violent crime; nor was there any reason to believe he would do so if permitted to escape.  Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest he intended to harm anyone.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The \xe2\x80\x9cthreat of serious physical harm, either to the officer or to others,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid., </em>that provides the sole justification for Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s use of deadly force was the risk that while fleeing in his vehicle Haugen would accidentally collide with a pedestrian or another vehicle.  Whether Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s shot enhanced or minimized that risk is debatable, but the risk of such an accident surely did not justify an attempt to kill the fugitive.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Thus, I have no difficulty in endorsing the Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s conduct violated the Constitution.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0An officer is entitled to qualified immunity, despite having engaged in constitutionally deficient conduct, if, in doing so, she did not violate \xe2\x80\x9cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Harlow</em>, 457 U. S., at 818.  The requirement that the law be clearly established is designed to ensure that officers have fair notice of what conduct is proscribed.  See<em> Hope</em> v. <em>Pelzer,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/730/index.html">536 U. S. 730</a>, 739 (2002).  Accordingly, we have recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral statements of the law are not inherently incapable of giving fair and clear warning,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Lanier,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/520/259/index.html">520 U. S. 259</a>, 271 (1997), and have firmly rejected the notion that \xe2\x80\x9can official action is protected by qualified immunity unless the very action in question has previously been held unlawful,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Creighton,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/483/635/index.html">483 U. S. 635</a>, 640 (1987).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s search for relevant case law applying the <em>Garner </em>standard to materially similar facts is both unnecessary and ill-advised.  See <em>Hope</em>, 536 U. S., at 741 (\xe2\x80\x9cAlthough earlier cases involving\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98fundamentally similar\xe2\x80\x99 facts can provide especially strong support for a conclusion that the law is clearly established, they are not necessary to such a finding\xe2\x80\x9d); see also<em> Lanier</em>, 520 U. S., at 269.  Indeed, the cases the majority relies on are inapposite and, in fact, only serve to illuminate the patent unreasonableness of Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s actions.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rather than uncertainty about the law, it is uncertainty about the likely consequences of Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s flight\xe2\x80\x94or, more precisely, uncertainty about how a reasonable officer making the split-second decision to use deadly force would have assessed the foreseeability of a serious accident\xe2\x80\x94that prevents me from answering the question of qualified immunity that this case presents.  This is a quintessentially \xe2\x80\x9cfact-specific\xe2\x80\x9d question, not a question that judges should try to answer \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of law.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>Anderson,</em> 483 U. S., at 641.  Although it is preferable to resolve the qualified immunity question at the earliest possible stage of litigation, this preference does not give judges license to take inherently factual questions away from the jury.  See <em>Hunter</em> v. <em>Bryant,</em> <a href="/cases/federal/us/502/224/index.html">502 U. S. 224</a>, 229 (1991) <em>(per curiam) </em>(Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); <em>id., </em>at 233 (Stevens, J., dissenting) (quoting <em>Bryant </em>v. <em>U. S. Treasury Dept.</em>, <em>Secret Service, </em>903 F.\xc2\xa02d 717, 720 (CA9 1990) (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether a reasonable officer could have believed he had probable cause is a question for the trier of fact, and summary judgment or a directed verdict in a \xc2\xa71983 action based on [the] lack of probable cause is proper only if there is only one reasonable conclusion a jury could reach\xe2\x80\x9d)).  The bizarre scenario described in the record of this case convinces me that reasonable jurors could well disagree about the answer to the qualified immunity issue.  My conclusion is strongly reinforced by the differing opinions expressed by the Circuit Judges who have reviewed the record.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to justify its decision to reverse the Court of Appeals without giving the parties an opportunity to provide full briefing and oral argument is woefully unpersuasive.  If Brosseau had deliberately shot Haugen in the head and killed him, the legal issues would have been the same as those resulting from the nonfatal wound.  I seriously doubt that my colleagues would be so confident about the result as to decide the case without the benefit of briefs or argument on such facts.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  At a minimum, the Ninth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision was not clearly erroneous, and the extraordinary remedy of summary reversal is not warranted on these facts.  See<em> </em>R. Stern, E. Gressman, &amp; S. Shapiro, Supreme Court Practice 281 (6th ed. 1986).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, the constitutional limits on an officer\xe2\x80\x99s use of deadly force have been well settled in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence for nearly two decades, and, in this case, Officer Brosseau acted outside of those clearly delineated bounds.  Nonetheless, in my judgment, there is a genuine factual question as to whether a reasonably well-trained officer standing in Brosseau\xe2\x80\x99s shoes could have concluded otherwise, and that question plainly falls with the purview of the jury.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Although Brosseau attested that she believed Haugen may have been attempting to retrieve a weapon from the floorboard of his vehicle sometime during the struggle, a fact which Haugen hotly contests, there is no evidence in the record to suggest that, at the time the shot was fired, Brosseau believed, or any reasonable officer would have thought, that Haugen had access to a weapon at that moment.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0At the time of the shooting, Brosseau had the following facts at her disposal.  Haugen had a felony no-bail warrant for a nonviolent drug offense, was suspected in a nonviolent burglary, and had been fleeing from law enforcement on foot for approximately 30 to 45 minutes without incident.  At the behest of Brosseau, the private individuals on the scene were inside their respective vehicles.  Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend and daughter were in a small car approximately four feet in front and slightly to the right of Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s Jeep; Glen Tamburello and Matt Atwood were inside a pickup truck on the street blocking the driveway, approximately 20 to 30 feet from Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s Jeep.  The only two police officers on foot at the scene were last seen in a neighbor\xe2\x80\x99s backyard, two houses down and to the right of the driveway.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The evidence supporting Haugen\xe2\x80\x99s allegation that Brosseau did \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully fire her weapon with the intent to murder me,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Record, Doc.

During the course of the pursuit, the driver passed traffic on both shoulders of the interstate, repeatedly attempted to ram several police cars, drove more than 100 passenger vehicles off the road, ran through several roadblocks, and continued driving after the officer shot out the wheels of the fugitive\xe2\x80\x99s truck.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1330\xe2\x80\x931331.  Only then did the officer finally resort to deadly force to disable the driver.  Similarly, in <em>Smith </em>v. <em>Freland</em>, 954 F.\xc2\xa02d 343 (CA6 1992), the suspect led a police officer on a high-speed chase, reaching speeds in excess of 90 miles per hour.  When the officer initially cornered the suspect in a field, the driver repeatedly swerved directly toward the police car, forcing the officer to move out of the way and allowing the suspect to continue the chase.  <em>Id., </em>at 344.  Only after additional officers cornered the suspect for a second time, and after the suspect smashed directly into an unoccupied police car and began to flee again, did the officer finally shoot the driver.  Ibid.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In stark contrast, at the time Brosseau shot Haugen, the Jeep was immobile, or at best, had just started moving.  Haugen had not driven at excess speeds; nor had he rammed, or attempted to ram, nearby police cars or passenger vehicles.  In sum, there was no ongoing or prior high-speed car chase to inform the probable cause analysis.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s recitation of the facts that led up to the shooting obscures the undisputed point that no one contends Haugen was the kind of dangerous person\xe2\x80\x94perhaps a terrorist or an escaped convict on a crime spree\xe2\x80\x94who would have been a danger to the community if he had been allowed to escape.
