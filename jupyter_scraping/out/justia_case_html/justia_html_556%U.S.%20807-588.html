Thus, the facilities are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act, which mandates that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny standard established pursuant to section 1311 \xe2\x80\xa6 or section 1316 \xe2\x80\xa6 and applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(b).  Sections 1311 and 1316, in turn, employ a variety of \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology\xe2\x80\x9d standards to regulate effluent discharge into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters.  The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) promulgated the \xc2\xa71326(b) regulations at issue after nearly three decades of making the \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available\xe2\x80\x9d determination on a case-by-case basis.  Its \xe2\x80\x9cPhase I\xe2\x80\x9d regulations govern new cooling water intake structures, while the \xe2\x80\x9cPhase II\xe2\x80\x9d rules at issue apply to certain large existing facilities.  In the latter rules, the EPA set \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring most Phase II facilities to reduce \xe2\x80\x9cimpingement mortality for [aquatic organisms] by 80 to 95 percent from the calculation baseline,\xe2\x80\x9d and requiring a subset of facilities to reduce entrainment of such organisms by \xe2\x80\x9c60 to 90 percent from [that] baseline.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(b)(1), (2).  However, the EPA expressly declined to mandate closed-cycle cooling systems, or equivalent reductions in impingement and entrainment, as it had done in its Phase I rules, in part because the cost of rendering existing facilities closed-cycle compliant would be nine times the estimated cost of compliance with the Phase II performance standards, and because other technologies could approach the performance of closed-cycle operation.  The Phase II rules also permit site-specific variances from the national performance standards, provided that the permit-issuing authority imposes remedial measures that yield results \xe2\x80\x9cas close as practicable to the applicable performance standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii)<em>.</em>  Respondents\xe2\x80\x94environmental groups and various States\xe2\x80\x94challenged the Phase II regulations.  Concluding that cost-benefit analysis is impermissible under 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(b), the Second Circuit found the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision unlawful and remanded the regulations to the EPA for it to clarify whether it had relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>The EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.

S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  The Second Circuit took \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology\xe2\x80\x9d to mean the technology that achieves the greatest reduction in adverse environmental impacts at a reasonable cost to the industry, but it may also describe the technology that <em>most efficiently</em> produces a good, even if it produces a lesser quantity of that good than other available technologies.  This reading is not precluded by the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfor minimizing adverse environmental impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minimizing admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest possible reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  Other Clean Water Act provisions show that when Congress wished to mandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution, it used plain language, <em>e.g., </em>\xe2\x80\x9celimination of discharges of all pollutants,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71311(b)(2)(A).  Thus, \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the less ambitious goal of \xe2\x80\x9cminimizing adverse environmental impact\xe2\x80\x9d suggests that the EPA has some discretion to determine the extent of reduction warranted under the circumstances, plausibly involving a consideration of the benefits derived from reductions and the costs of achieving them.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Considering \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text, and comparing it with the text and statutory factors applicable to parallel Clean Water Act provisions, prompts the conclusion that it was well within the bounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to conclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbidden.  In the Phase II rules the EPA sought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits, limiting variances from Phase II\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards\xe2\x80\x9d to circumstances where the costs are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than the benefits\xe2\x80\x9d of compliance.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(ii).  In defining \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA assumed the application of technologies whose benefits approach those estimated for closed-cycle cooling systems at a fraction of the cost.  That the EPA has for over thirty years interpreted \xc2\xa71326(b) to permit a comparison of costs and benefits, while not conclusive, also tends to show that its interpretation is reasonable and hence a legitimate exercise of its discretion.  Even respondents and the Second Circuit ultimately recognize that some comparison of costs and benefits is permitted.  The Second Circuit held that \xc2\xa71326(b) mandates only those technologies whose costs can be reasonably borne by the industry.  But whether it is reasonable to bear a particular cost can very well depend on the resulting benefits.  Likewise, respondents concede that the EPA need not require that industry spend billions to save one more fish.  This concedes the principle, and there is no statutory basis for limiting the comparison of costs and benefits to situations where the benefits are <em>de minimis</em> rather than significantly disproportionate.

The issue for our decision is whether, as the Second Circuit held, the EPA is not permitted to use cost-benefit analysis in determining the content of regulations promulgated under \xc2\xa71326(b).</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioners operate\xe2\x80\x94or represent those who operate\xe2\x80\x94large powerplants.  In the course of generating power, those plants also generate large amounts of heat.  To cool their facilities, petitioners employ \xe2\x80\x9ccooling water intake structures\xe2\x80\x9d that extract water from nearby water sources.  These structures pose various threats to the environment, chief among them the squashing against intake screens (elegantly called \xe2\x80\x9cimpingement\xe2\x80\x9d) or suction into the cooling system (\xe2\x80\x9centrainment\xe2\x80\x9d) of aquatic organisms that live in the affected water sources.  See 69 Fed. Reg. 41586.  Accordingly, the facilities are subject to regulation under the Clean Water Act, 33 U.

The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s initial attempt at such a regulation came to nought when the Fourth Circuit determined that the agency had failed to adhere to the procedural requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act.  <em>Appalachian Power Co.</em> v. <em>Train</em>, 566 F.\xc2\xa02d 451, 457 (1977).  The EPA withdrew the regulation, 44 Fed. Reg. 32956 (1979), and instead published \xe2\x80\x9cdraft guidance\xe2\x80\x9d for use in implementing \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s requirements via site-specific permit decisions under \xc2\xa71342.  See EPA, Office of Water Enforcement Permits Div., &lt;{&gt;Draft&lt;}&gt; Guidance for Evaluating the Adverse Impact of Cooling Water Intake Structures on the Aquatic Environment: Section 316(b) P.\xc2\xa0L. 92\xe2\x80\x93500, (May 1, 1977), at http://www.epa.gov/waterscience/316b/files/1977AEIguid.pdf, (all Internet materials as visited Mar. 30, 2009, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); 69 Fed. Reg. 41584 (describing system of case-by-case permits under the draft guidance).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1995, the EPA entered into a consent decree which, as subsequently amended, set a multiphase timetable for the EPA to promulgate regulations under \xc2\xa71326(b).  See <em>Riverkeeper, Inc.</em> v. <em>Whitman</em>, No. 93 Civ. 0314 (AGS), 2001 WL 1505497, *1 (SDNY, Nov. 27, 2001).  In the first phase the EPA adopted regulations governing certain new, large cooling water intake structures.  66 Fed. Reg. 65256 (2001) (Phase I rules); see 40 CFR \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7125.80(a), 125.81(a) (2008).  Those rules require new facilities with water-intake flow greater than 10 million gallons per day to, among other things, restrict their inflow \xe2\x80\x9cto a level commensurate with that which can be attained by a closed-cycle recirculating cooling water system.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  \xc2\xa7125.84(b)(1).  New facilities with water-intake flow between 2 million and 10 million gallons per day may alternatively comply by, among other things, reducing the volume and velocity of water removal to certain levels.  \xc2\xa7125.84(c).  And all facilities may alternatively comply by demonstrating, among other things, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the technologies employed will reduce the level of adverse environmental impact \xe2\x80\xa6 to a comparable level\xe2\x80\x9d to what would be achieved by using a closed-cycle cooling system.  \xc2\xa7125.84(d).  These regulations were upheld in large part by the Second Circuit in <em>Riverkeeper, Inc.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 358 F.\xc2\xa03d 174 (2004).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EPA then adopted the so-called \xe2\x80\x9cPhase II\xe2\x80\x9d rules at issue here.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  69 Fed. Reg. 41576.  They apply to existing facilities that are point sources, whose primary activity is the generation and transmission (or sale for transmission) of electricity, and whose water-intake flow is more than 50 million gallons of water per day, at least 25 percent of which is used for cooling purposes.  <em>Ibid.</em>  Over 500 facilities, accounting for approximately 53 percent of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s electric-power generating capacity, fall within Phase II\xe2\x80\x99s ambit.  See EPA, Economic and Benefits Analysis for the Final Section 316(b) Phase II Existing Facilities Rule, A3\xe2\x80\x9313, Table A3\xe2\x80\x934 (Feb. 2004), online at http://www.\nepa.gov/waterscience/316b/phase2/econbenefits/final/a3.pdf.  Those facilities remove on average more than 214 billion gallons of water per day, causing impingement and entrainment of over 3.4 billion aquatic organisms per year.  69 Fed. Reg. 41586.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To address those environmental impacts, the EPA set \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards,\xe2\x80\x9d requiring Phase II facilities (with some exceptions) to reduce \xe2\x80\x9cimpingement mortality for all life stages of fish and shellfish by 80 to 95 percent from the calculation baseline\xe2\x80\x9d; a subset of facilities must also reduce entrainment of such aquatic organisms by \xe2\x80\x9c60 to 90 percent from the calculation baseline.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(b)(1), (2); see \xc2\xa7125.93 (defining \xe2\x80\x9ccalculation baseline\xe2\x80\x9d).  Those targets are based on the environmental improvements achievable through deployment of a mix of remedial technologies, 69 Fed. Reg. 41599, which the EPA determined were \xe2\x80\x9ccommercially available and economically practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 41602.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In its Phase II rules, however, the EPA expressly declined to mandate adoption of closed-cycle cooling systems or equivalent reductions in impingement and entrainment, as it had done for new facilities subject to the Phase I rules.  <em>Id.,</em> at 41601.  It refused to take that step in part because of the \xe2\x80\x9cgenerally high costs\xe2\x80\x9d of converting existing facilities to closed-cycle operation, and because \xe2\x80\x9cother technologies approach the performance of this option.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 41605.  Thus, while closed-cycle cooling systems could reduce impingement and entrainment mortality by up to 98 percent, <em>id.</em>, at 41601, (compared to the Phase II targets of 80 to 95 percent impingement reduction), the cost of rendering all Phase II facilities closed-cycle-compliant would be approximately $3.5 billion per year, <em>id.</em>, at 41605, nine times the estimated cost of compliance with the Phase II performance standards, <em>id.,</em> at 41666.  Moreover, Phase II facilities compelled to convert to closed-cycle cooling systems \xe2\x80\x9cwould produce 2.4 percent to 4.0 percent less electricity even while burning the same amount of coal,\xe2\x80\x9d possibly requiring the construction of \xe2\x80\x9c20 additional 400\xe2\x80\x93MW plants \xe2\x80\xa6 to replace the generating capacity lost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 41605.  The EPA thus concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough not identical, the ranges of impingement and entrainment reduction are similar under both options\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  [Benefits of compliance with the Phase II rules] can approach those of closed-cycle recirculating at less cost with fewer implementation problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 41606.</p>\n<p>\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulations permit the issuance of site-specific variances from the national performance standards if a facility can demonstrate either that the costs of compliance are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than\xe2\x80\x9d the costs considered by the agency in setting the standards, 40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(i), or that the costs of compliance \xe2\x80\x9cwould be significantly greater than the benefits of complying with the applicable performance standards,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(ii).  Where a variance is warranted, the permit-issuing authority must impose remedial measures that yield results \xe2\x80\x9cas close as practicable to the applicable performance standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(i), (ii)<em>.</em></font></p><font b="1"><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents challenged the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Phase II regulations, and the Second Circuit granted their petition for review and remanded the regulations to the EPA.  The Second Circuit identified two ways in which the EPA could permissibly consider costs under 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(b): (1) in determining whether the costs of remediation \xe2\x80\x9ccan be \xe2\x80\x98reasonably borne\xe2\x80\x99 by the industry,\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) in determining which remedial technologies are the most cost-effective, that is, the technologies that reach a specified level of benefit at the lowest cost.  475 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 99\xe2\x80\x93100.  See also <em>id.,</em> at 98, and n.\xc2\xa010.  It concluded, however, that cost-benefit analysis, which \xe2\x80\x9ccompares the costs and benefits of various ends, and chooses the end with the best net benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 98, is impermissible under \xc2\xa71326(b), <em>id.,</em> at<em> </em>100.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals held the site-specific cost-benefit variance provision to be unlawful.  <em>Id</em>., at 114.

(The remand was also based on other grounds which are not at issue here.)  The EPA suspended operation of the Phase II rules pending further rulemaking.  72 Fed. Reg. 37107 (2007).

That is certainly a plausible interpretation of the statute.  The \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d technology\xe2\x80\x94that which is \xe2\x80\x9cmost advantageous,\xe2\x80\x9d Webster\xe2\x80\x99s New International Dictionary 258 (2d ed. 1953)\xe2\x80\x94may well be the one that produces the most of some good, here a reduction in adverse environmental impact.  But \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology\xe2\x80\x9d may also describe the technology that <em>most efficiently</em> produces some good.  In common parlance one could certainly use the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to that which produces a good at the lowest per-unit cost, even if it produces a lesser quantity of that good than other available technologies.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents contend that this latter reading is precluded by the statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cfor minimizing adverse environmental impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  Minimizing, they argue, means reducing to the smallest amount possible, and the \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts,\xe2\x80\x9d must be the economically feasible technology that achieves the greatest possible reduction in environmental harm.  Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc. et\xc2\xa0al. 25\xe2\x80\x9326.  But \xe2\x80\x9cminimize\xe2\x80\x9d is a term that admits of degree and is not necessarily used to refer exclusively to the \xe2\x80\x9cgreatest possible reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  For example, elsewhere in the Clean Water Act, Congress declared that the procedures implementing the Act \xe2\x80\x9cshall encourage the drastic<em> </em>minimization of paperwork and interagency decision procedures.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71251(f).  If respondents\xe2\x80\x99 definition of the term \xe2\x80\x9cminimize\xe2\x80\x9d is correct, the statute\xe2\x80\x99s use of the modifier \xe2\x80\x9cdrastic\xe2\x80\x9d is superfluous.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other provisions in the Clean Water Act also suggest the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation.  When Congress wished to mandate the greatest feasible reduction in water pollution, it did so in plain language: The provision governing the discharge of toxic pollutants into the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s waters requires the EPA to set \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitations [which] shall require the <em>elimination</em> of discharges of all pollutants if the Administrator finds \xe2\x80\xa6 that such elimination is technologically and economically achievable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71311(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added).  See also \xc2\xa71316(a)(1) (mandating \xe2\x80\x9cwhere practicable, a standard [for new point sources] permitting <em>no discharge</em> of pollutants\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  Section 1326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s use of the less ambitious goal of \xe2\x80\x9cminimizing adverse environmental impact\xe2\x80\x9d suggests, we think, that the agency retains some discretion to determine the extent of reduction that is warranted under the circumstances.  That determination could plausibly involve a consideration of the benefits derived from reductions and the costs of achieving them.  Cf. 40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.83 (defining \xe2\x80\x9cminimize\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of the Phase I regulations as \xe2\x80\x9creduc[ing] to the smallest amount, extent, or degree reasonably possible\xe2\x80\x9d).  It seems to us, therefore, that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available,\xe2\x80\x9d even with the added specification \xe2\x80\x9cfor minimizing adverse environmental impact,\xe2\x80\x9d does not unambiguously preclude cost-benefit analysis.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 alternative (and, alas, also more complex) argument rests upon the structure of the Clean Water Act.  The Act provided that during its initial implementation period existing \xe2\x80\x9cpoint sources\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94discrete conveyances from which pollutants are or may be discharged, 33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71362(14)\xe2\x80\x94were subject to \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitations \xe2\x80\xa6 which shall require the application of the <em>best practicable control technology</em> currently available.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71311(b)(1)(A) (emphasis added).  (We shall call this the \xe2\x80\x9cBPT\xe2\x80\x9d test.)  Following that transition period, the Act initially mandated adoption, by July 1, 1983 (later extended to March 31, 1989), of stricter effluent limitations requiring \xe2\x80\x9capplication of the <em>best available technology economically achievable</em> for such category or class, which will result in reasonable further progress toward the national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71311(b)(2)(A) (emphasis added); see <em>EPA</em> v. <em>National Crushed Stone Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/64/index.html">449 U. S. 64</a>, 69\xe2\x80\x9370 (1980).  (We shall call this the \xe2\x80\x9cBATEA\xe2\x80\x9d test.)  Subsequent amendment limited application of this standard to toxic and nonconventional pollutants, and for the remainder established a (presumably laxer) test of \xe2\x80\x9cbest conventional-pollutant control technology.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71311(b)(2)(E).[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  (We shall call this \xe2\x80\x9cBCT.\xe2\x80\x9d)  Finally, \xc2\xa71316 subjected certain categories of new point sources to \xe2\x80\x9cthe greatest degree of effluent reduction which the Administrator determines to be achievable through application of the <em>best available demonstrated control technology</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71316(a)(1) (emphasis added); \xc2\xa71316(b)(1)(B).  (We shall call this the \xe2\x80\x9cBADT\xe2\x80\x9d test.)  The provision at issue here, applicable not to effluents but to cooling water intake structures, requires, as we have described, \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa71326(b) (emphasis added).  (We shall call this the \xe2\x80\x9cBTA\xe2\x80\x9d test.)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first four of these tests are elucidated by statutory factor lists that guide their implementation.  To take the standards in (presumed) order of increasing stringency, see <em>Crushed Stone, supra,</em> at 69\xe2\x80\x9370: In applying the BPT test the EPA is instructed to consider, among other factors, \xe2\x80\x9cthe total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71314(b)(1)(B).  In applying the BCT test it is instructed to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>reasonableness of the relationship</em> between the costs of attaining a reduction in effluents and the effluent reduction benefits derived.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71314(b)(4)(B) (emphasis added).  And in applying the BATEA and BADT tests the EPA is instructed to consider the \xe2\x80\x9ccost of achieving such effluent reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71314(b)(2)(B), 1316(b)(1)(B).  There is no such elucidating language applicable to the BTA test at issue here.  To facilitate comparison, the texts of these five tests, the clarifying factors applicable to them, and the entities to which they apply are set forth in the Appendix, <em>infra.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Second Circuit, in rejecting the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s use of cost-benefit analysis, relied in part on the propositions that (1) cost-benefit analysis is precluded under the BATEA and BADT tests; and (2) that, insofar as the permissibility of cost-benefit analysis is concerned, the BTA test (the one at issue here) is to be treated the same as those two.  See 475 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 98.  It is not obvious to us that the first of these propositions is correct, but we need not pursue that point, since we assuredly do not agree with the second.  It is certainly reasonable for the agency to conclude that the BTA test need not be interpreted to permit only what those other two tests permit.  Its text is not identical to theirs.  It has the relatively modest goal of \xe2\x80\x9cminimizing adverse environmental impact\xe2\x80\x9d as compared with the BATEA\xe2\x80\x99s goal of \xe2\x80\x9celiminating the discharge of all pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  And it is unencumbered by specified statutory factors of the sort provided for those other two tests, which omission can reasonably be interpreted to suggest that the EPA is accorded greater discretion in determining its precise content.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondents and the dissent argue that the mere fact that \xc2\xa71326(b) does not expressly authorize cost-benefit analysis for the BTA test, though it does so for two of the other tests, displays an intent to forbid its use.  This surely proves too much.  For while it is true that two of the other tests authorize cost-benefit analysis, it is also true that <em>all four</em> of the other tests expressly authorize <em>some</em> consideration of costs.  Thus, if respondents\xe2\x80\x99 and the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion regarding the import of \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s silence is correct, it is <em>a fortiori </em>true that the BTA test permits <em>no consideration of cost whatsoever</em>, not even the \xe2\x80\x9ccost-effectiveness\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfeasibility\xe2\x80\x9d analysis that the Second Circuit approved, see<em> supra,</em> at 6, that the dissent would approve, <em>post,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x932, and that respondents acknowledge.  The inference that respondents and the dissent would draw from the silence is, in any event, implausible, as \xc2\xa71326(b) is silent not only with respect to cost-benefit analysis but with respect to all potentially relevant factors.  If silence here implies prohibition, then the EPA could not consider <em>any </em>factors in implementing \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x94an obvious logical impossibility.  It is eminently reasonable to conclude that \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s silence is meant to convey nothing more than a refusal to tie the agency\xe2\x80\x99s hands as to whether cost-benefit analysis should be used, and if so to what degree.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, see<em> post</em>, at 3\xe2\x80\x934, our decisions in <em>Whitman</em> v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a> (2001), and <em>American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc.</em> v. <em>Donovan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/index.html">452 U. S. 490</a> (1981), do not undermine this conclusion.  In <em>American Trucking</em>, we held that the text of \xc2\xa7109 of the Clean Air Act, \xe2\x80\x9cinterpreted in its statutory and historical context \xe2\x80\xa6 unambiguously bars cost considerations\xe2\x80\x9d in setting air quality standards under that provision.  531 U. S., at 471.  The relevant \xe2\x80\x9cstatutory context\xe2\x80\x9d included other provisions in the Clean Air Act that expressly authorized consideration of costs, whereas \xc2\xa7109 did not.  <em>Id.</em>, at 467\xe2\x80\x93468.  <em>American Trucking</em> thus stands for the rather unremarkable proposition that sometimes statutory silence, when viewed in context, is best interpreted as limiting agency discretion.  For the reasons discussed earlier, \xc2\xa71326(b)\xe2\x80\x99s silence cannot bear that interpretation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>American Textile</em>, the Court relied in part on a statute\xe2\x80\x99s failure to mention cost-benefit analysis in holding that the relevant agency was not required to engage in cost-benefit analysis in setting certain health and safety standards.  452 U. S., at 510\xe2\x80\x93512.  But under <em>Chevron</em>, that an agency is not <em>required </em>to do so does not mean that an agency is not <em>permitted </em>to do so.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This extended consideration of the text of \xc2\xa71326(b), and comparison of that with the text and statutory factors applicable to four parallel provisions of the Clean Water Act, lead us to the conclusion that it was well within the bounds of reasonable interpretation for the EPA to conclude that cost-benefit analysis is not categorically forbidden.  Other arguments may be available to preclude such a rigorous form of cost-benefit analysis as that which was prescribed under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s former BPT standard, which required weighing \xe2\x80\x9cthe total cost of application of technology\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\xa6 benefits to be achieved.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>supra</em>, at 10.  But that question is not before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the Phase II requirements challenged here the EPA sought only to avoid extreme disparities between costs and benefits.  The agency limited variances from the Phase II \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards\xe2\x80\x9d to circumstances where the costs are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than the benefits\xe2\x80\x9d of compliance.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(ii).  In defining the \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards\xe2\x80\x9d themselves the EPA assumed the application of technologies whose benefits \xe2\x80\x9capproach those estimated\xe2\x80\x9d for closed-cycle cooling systems at a fraction of the cost: $389 million per year, 69 Fed. Reg. 41666, as compared with (1) at least $3.5 billion per year to operate compliant closed-cycle cooling systems, <em>id.,</em> at 41605 (or $1 billion per year to impose similar requirements on a subset of Phase II facilities, <em>id.,</em> at 41606), and (2) significant reduction in the energy output of the altered facilities, <em>id.,</em> at 41605.  And finally, EPA\xe2\x80\x99s assessment of the relatively meager financial benefits of the Phase II regulations that it adopted\xe2\x80\x94reduced impingement and entrainment of 1.4 billion aquatic organisms, <em>id.,</em> at 41661, Exh. XII\xe2\x80\x936, with annualized use-benefits of $83 million, <em>id.,</em> at 41662, and non-use benefits of indeterminate value, <em>id.,</em> at 41660\xe2\x80\x9341661\xe2\x80\x94when compared to annual costs of $389 million, demonstrates quite clearly that the agency did not select the Phase II regulatory requirements because their benefits equaled their costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While not conclusive, it surely tends to show that the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s current practice is a reasonable and hence legitimate exercise of its discretion to weigh benefits against costs that the agency has been proceeding in essentially this fashion for over 30 years.  See <em>Alaska Dept. of Environmental Conservation</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/540/461/index.html">540 U. S. 461</a>, 487 (2004); <em>Barnhart</em> v. <em>Walton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/212/index.html">535 U. S. 212</a>, 219\xe2\x80\x93220 (2002).  As early as 1977, the agency determined that, while \xc2\xa71326(b) does not <em>require</em> cost-benefit analysis, it is also not reasonable to \xe2\x80\x9cinterpret Section [1326(b)] as requiring use of technology whose cost is wholly disproportionate to the environmental benefit to be gained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Public Service Co. of New Hampshire</em>, 1 E.\xc2\xa0A.\xc2\xa0D. 332, 340 (1977).  See also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Central Hudson Gas and Electric Corp.</em>, EPA Decision of the General Counsel, NPDES Permits, No. 63, pp. 371, 381 (July 29, 1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cEPA ultimately must demonstrate that the present value of the cumulative annual cost of modifications to cooling water intake structures is not wholly out of proportion to the magnitude of the estimated environmental gains\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League</em> v. <em>Costle</em>, 597 F.\xc2\xa02d 306, 311 (CA1 1979) (rejecting challenge to an EPA permit decision that was based in part on the agency\xe2\x80\x99s determination that further restrictions would be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98wholly disproportionate to any environmental benefit\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  While the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s prior \xe2\x80\x9cwholly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d standard may be somewhat different from its current \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than\xe2\x80\x9d standard, there is nothing in the statute that would indicate that the former is a permissible interpretation while the latter is not.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in its review of the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s Phase I regulations, the Second Circuit seemed to recognize that \xc2\xa71326(b) permits some form of cost-benefit analysis.  In considering a challenge to the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of dry cooling systems[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] as the \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available\xe2\x80\x9d for Phase I facilities the Second Circuit noted that \xe2\x80\x9cwhile it certainly sounds substantial that dry cooling is 95 percent more effective than closed-cycle cooling, it is undeniably relevant that that difference represents a relatively small improvement over closed-cycle cooling at a very significant cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Riverkeeper</em>, 358 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 194, n. 22.  And in the decision below rejecting the use of cost-benefit analysis in the Phase II regulations, the Second Circuit nonetheless interpreted \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available\xe2\x80\x9d as mandating only those technologies that can \xe2\x80\x9cbe reasonably borne by the industry.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 99.  But whether it is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable\xe2\x80\x9d to bear a particular cost may well depend on the resulting benefits; if the only relevant factor was the feasibility of the costs, their reasonableness would be irrelevant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In the last analysis, even respondents ultimately recognize that some form of cost-benefit analysis is permissible.  They acknowledge that the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language is \xe2\x80\x9cplainly not so constricted as to require EPA to require industry petitioners to spend billions to save one more fish or plankton.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc. et\xc2\xa0al. 29.  This concedes the principle\xe2\x80\x94the permissibility of at least some cost-benefit analysis\xe2\x80\x94and we see no statutory basis for limiting its use to situations where the benefits are <em>de minimis</em> rather than significantly disproportionate.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We conclude that the EPA permissibly relied on cost-benefit analysis in setting the national performance standards and in providing for cost-benefit variances from those standards as part of the Phase II regulations.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(b), which governs industrial powerplant water intake structures, provides that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA or Agency) \xe2\x80\x9cshall require\xe2\x80\x9d that such structures \xe2\x80\x9creflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact.\xe2\x80\x9d  The EPA has interpreted that mandate to authorize the use of cost-benefit analysis in promulgating regulations under \xc2\xa7316(b).  For instance, under the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation, technology that would otherwise qualify as the best available need not be used if its costs are \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than the benefits\xe2\x80\x9d of compliance.  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(ii) (2008).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Like the Court of Appeals, I am convinced that the EPA has misinterpreted the plain text of \xc2\xa7316(b).  Unless costs are so high that the best technology is not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable,\xe2\x80\x9d Congress has decided that they are outweighed by the benefits of minimizing adverse environmental impact.  Section 316(b) neither expressly nor implicitly authorizes the EPA to use cost-benefit analysis when setting regulatory standards; fairly read, it prohibits such use.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As typically performed by the EPA, cost-benefit analysis requires the Agency to first monetize the costs and benefits of a regulation, balance the results, and then choose the regulation with the greatest net benefits.  The process is particularly controversial in the environmental context in which a regulation\xe2\x80\x99s financial costs are often more obvious and easier to quantify than its environmental benefits.  And cost-benefit analysis often, if not always, yields a result that does not maximize environmental protection.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For instance, although the EPA estimated that water intake structures kill 3.4 billion fish and shellfish each year,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] see 69 Fed. Reg. 41586, the Agency struggled to calculate the value of the aquatic life that would be protected under its \xc2\xa7316(b) regulations, <em>id.</em>, at 41661.  To compensate, the EPA took a shortcut: Instead of monetizing all aquatic life, the Agency counted only those species that are commercially or recreationally harvested, a tiny slice (1.8 percent to be precise) of all impacted fish and shellfish.  This narrow focus in turn skewed the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s calculation of benefits.  When the EPA attempted to value all aquatic life, the benefits measured $735 million.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  But when the EPA decided to give zero value to the 98.2 percent of fish not commercially or recreationally harvested, the benefits calculation dropped dramatically\xe2\x80\x94to $83 million.  <em>Id.</em>,<em> </em>at 41666.  The Agency acknowledged that its failure to monetize the other 98.2 percent of affected species \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98could result in serious misallocation of resources,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>,<em> </em>at 41660, because its \xe2\x80\x9ccomparison of complete costs and incomplete benefits does not provide an accurate picture of net benefits to society.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because benefits can be more accurately monetized in some industries than in others, Congress typically decides whether it is appropriate for an agency to use cost-benefit analysis in crafting regulations.  Indeed, this Court has recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen Congress has intended that an agency engage in cost-benefit analysis, it has clearly indicated such intent on the face of the statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>American Textile Mfrs. Institute, Inc.</em> v. <em>Donovan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/490/index.html">452 U. S. 490</a>, 510 (1981).  Accordingly, we should not treat a provision\xe2\x80\x99s silence as an implicit source of cost-benefit authority, particularly when such authority is elsewhere expressly granted and it has the potential to fundamentally alter an agency\xe2\x80\x99s approach to regulation.  Congress, we have noted, \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not alter the fundamental details of a regulatory scheme in vague terms or ancillary provisions\xe2\x80\x94it does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Whitman </em>v. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/531/457/index.html">531 U. S. 457</a>, 467\xe2\x80\x93468 (2001).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When interpreting statutory silence in the past, we have sought guidance from a statute\xe2\x80\x99s other provisions.  Evidence that Congress confronted an issue in some parts of a statute, while leaving it unaddressed in others, can demonstrate that Congress meant its silence to be decisive.  We concluded as much in <em>American Trucking.</em>  In that case, the Court reviewed the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s claim that \xc2\xa7109 of the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa77409(a) (2000 ed.), authorized the Agency to consider implementation costs in setting ambient air quality standards.  We read \xc2\xa7109, which was silent on the matter, to prohibit Agency reliance on cost considerations.  After examining other provisions in which Congress had given the Agency authority to consider costs, the Court \xe2\x80\x9crefused to find implicit in ambiguous sections of the CAA an authorization to consider costs that has elsewhere, and so often, been expressly granted.\xe2\x80\x9d  531 U. S., at 467.  Studied silence, we thus concluded, can be as much a prohibition as an explicit \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further motivating the Court in <em>American Trucking</em> was the fact that incorporating implementation costs into the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s calculus risked countermanding Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision to protect public health.  The cost of implementation, we said, \xe2\x80\x9cis <em>both </em>so indirectly related to public health <em>and </em>so full of potential for canceling the conclusions drawn from direct health effects that it would surely have been expressly mentioned in [the text] had Congress meant it to be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 469.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>American Trucking</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em> </em>approach should have guided the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading of \xc2\xa7316(b).  Nowhere in the text of \xc2\xa7316(b) does Congress explicitly authorize the use of cost-benefit analysis as it does elsewhere in the CWA.  And the use of cost-benefit analysis, like the consideration of implementation costs in <em>American Trucking</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cpad[s]\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7316(b)\xe2\x80\x99s environmental mandate with tangential economic efficiency concerns.  <em>Id.</em>, at 468.<em> </em> Yet the majority fails to follow <em>American Trucking</em> despite that case\xe2\x80\x99s obvious relevance to our inquiry.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1972, Congress amended the CWA to strike a careful balance between the country\xe2\x80\x99s energy demands and its desire to protect the environment.  The Act required industry to adopt increasingly advanced technology capable of mitigating its detrimental environmental impact.  Not all point sources were subject to strict rules at once.  Existing plants were granted time to retrofit with the best technology while new plants were required to incorporate such technology as a matter of design.  Although Congress realized that technology standards would necessarily put some firms out of business, see <em>EPA </em>v. <em>National Crushed Stone Assn.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/64/index.html">449 U. S. 64</a>, 79 (1980), the statute\xe2\x80\x99s steady march was toward stricter rules and potentially higher costs.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section \xc2\xa7316(b) was an integral part of the statutory scheme.  The provision instructs that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny standard established pursuant to section 1311 of this title or section 1316 of this title and applicable to a point source shall require that the location, design, construction, and capacity of cooling water intake structures reflect the <em>best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impact</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71326(b) (2006 ed.) (emphasis added).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  The \xe2\x80\x9cbest technology available,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBTA,\xe2\x80\x9d standard delivers a clear command: To minimize the adverse environmental impact of water intake structures, the\nEPA must require industry to adopt the best technology available.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Based largely on the observation that \xc2\xa7316(b)\xe2\x80\x99s text offers little guidance and therefore delegates some amount of gap-filling authority to the EPA, the Court concludes that the Agency has discretion to rely on cost-benefit analysis.  See <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312.<em> </em>The Court assumes that, by not specifying how the EPA is to determine BTA, Congress intended to give considerable discretion to the EPA to decide how to proceed.  Silence, in the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view, represents ambiguity and an invitation for the Agency to decide for itself which factors should govern its regulatory approach.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The appropriate analysis requires full consideration of the CWA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and legislative history to determine whether Congress contemplated cost-benefit analysis and, if so, under what circumstances it directed the EPA to utilize it.  This approach reveals that Congress granted the EPA authority to use cost-benefit analysis in some contexts but not others, and that Congress intend to control, not delegate, when cost-benefit analysis should be used.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 842\xe2\x80\x93843 (1984).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Powerful evidence of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision not to authorize cost-benefit analysis in the BTA standard lies in the series of standards adopted to regulate the outflow, or effluent, from industrial powerplants.  Passed at the same time as the BTA standard at issue here, the effluent limitation standards imposed increasingly strict technology requirements on industry.  In each effluent limitation provision, Congress distinguished its willingness to allow the EPA to consider costs from its willingness to allow the Agency to conduct a cost-benefit analysis.  And to the extent Congress permitted cost-benefit analysis, its use was intended to be temporary and exceptional.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first tier of technology standards applied to existing plants\xe2\x80\x94facilities for which retrofitting would be particularly costly.  Congress required these plants to adopt \xe2\x80\x9ceffluent limitations \xe2\x80\xa6 which shall require the application of the best practicable control technology currently available.\xe2\x80\x9d  33 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71311(b)(1)(A).  Because this \xe2\x80\x9cbest practicable,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBPT,\xe2\x80\x9d standard was meant to ease industry\xe2\x80\x99s transition to the new technology-based regime, Congress gave BPT two unique features: First, it would be temporary, remaining in effect only until July 1, 1983.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Second, it specified that the EPA was to conduct a cost-benefit analysis in setting BPT requirements by considering \xe2\x80\x9cthe total cost of application of technology in relation to the effluent reduction benefits to be achieved from such application.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  \xc2\xa71314(b)(1)(B).  Permitting cost-benefit analysis in BPT gave the EPA the ability to cushion the new technology requirement.  For a limited time, a technology with costs that exceeded its benefits would not be considered \xe2\x80\x9cbest.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The second tier of technology standards required existing powerplants to adopt the \xe2\x80\x9cbest available technology economically achievable\xe2\x80\x9d to advance \xe2\x80\x9cthe national goal of eliminating the discharge of all pollutants.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71311(b)(2)(A).  In setting this \xe2\x80\x9cbest available technology,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBAT,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] standard, Congress gave the EPA a notably different command for deciding what technology would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cbest\xe2\x80\x9d: The EPA was to consider, among other factors, \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of achieving such effluent reduction,\xe2\x80\x9d but Congress did not grant it authority to balance costs with the benefits of stricter regulation.  \xc2\xa71314(b)(2)(B).  Indeed, in <em>Crushed Stone</em> this Court explained that the difference between BPT and BAT was the existence of cost-benefit authority in the first and the absence of that authority in the second.  See 449 U. S., at 71 (\xe2\x80\x9cSimilar directions are given the Administrator for determining effluent reductions attainable from the BAT except that in assessing BAT total cost is no longer to be considered in comparison to effluent reduction benefits\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The BAT standard\xe2\x80\x99s legislative history strongly supports the view that Congress purposefully withheld cost-benefit authority for this tier of regulation.  See <em>ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa010.  The House of Representatives and the Senate split over the role cost-benefit analysis would play in the BAT provision.  The House favored the tool, see H.\xc2\xa0R. Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x93911, p. 107 (1972), 1 Leg. Hist. 794, while the Senate rejected it, see 2 <em>id.</em>, at 1183; <em>id.</em>, at 1132.  The Senate view ultimately prevailed in the final legislation, resulting in a BAT standard that was \xe2\x80\x9cnot subject to any test of cost in relation to effluent reduction benefits or any form of cost/benefit analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 Legislative History of the Clean Water Act of 1977: A Continuation of the Legislative History of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (Committee Print compiled for the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works by the Library of Congress), Ser. No. 95\xe2\x80\x9314, p. 427 (1978).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The third and strictest regulatory tier was reserved for new point sources\xe2\x80\x94facilities that could incorporate technology improvements into their initial design.  These new facilities were required to adopt \xe2\x80\x9cthe best available demonstrated control technology,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBADT,\xe2\x80\x9d which Congress described as \xe2\x80\x9ca standard \xe2\x80\xa6 which reflect[s] the greatest degree of effluent reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71316(a)(1).  In administering BADT, Congress directed the EPA to consider \xe2\x80\x9cthe cost of achieving such effluent reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71316(b)(1)(B).  But because BADT was meant to be the most stringent standard of all, Congress made no mention of cost-benefit analysis.  Again, the silence was intentional.  The House\xe2\x80\x99s version of BADT originally contained an exemption for point sources for which \xe2\x80\x9cthe economic, social, and environmental costs bear no reasonable relationship to the economic, social, and environmental benefit to be obtained.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Leg. Hist. 798.  That this exemption did not appear in the final legislation demonstrates that Congress considered, and rejected, reliance on cost-benefit analysis for BADT.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is in this light that the BTA standard regulating water intake structures must be viewed.  The use of cost-benefit analysis was a critical component of the CWA\xe2\x80\x99s structure and a key concern in the legislative process.  We should therefore conclude that Congress intended to forbid cost-benefit analysis in one provision of the Act in which it was silent on the matter when it expressly authorized its use in another.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Allison Engine Co.</em> v. <em>United States ex rel.

This is particularly true given Congress\xe2\x80\x99 decision that cost-benefit analysis would play a temporary and exceptional role in the CWA to help existing plants transition to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s ambitious environmental standards.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  Allowing cost-benefit analysis in the BTA standard, a permanent mandate applicable to all powerplants, serves no such purpose and instead fundamentally weakens the provision\xe2\x80\x99s mandate.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, I would hold that the EPA is without authority to perform cost-benefit analysis in setting BTA standards.

This all-or-nothing reasoning rests on the deeply flawed assumption that Congress treated cost-benefit analysis as just one among many factors upon which the EPA could potentially rely to establish BTA.  Yet, as explained above, the structure and legislative history of the CWA demonstrate that Congress viewed cost-benefit analysis with special skepticism and controlled its use accordingly.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption of equivalence is thus plainly incorrect.  Properly read, Congress\xe2\x80\x99 silence in \xc2\xa7316(b) forbids reliance on the cost-benefit tool but does not foreclose reliance on all other considerations, such as a determination whether a technology is so costly that it is not \xe2\x80\x9cavailable\xe2\x80\x9d for industry to adopt.     </p>\n<a href="#T10" name="F10">Footnote 10</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In 1977, Congress established an additional technology-based standard, commonly referred to as \xe2\x80\x9cbest conventional pollutant control technology,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cBCT,\xe2\x80\x9d to govern conventional pollutants previously covered by the BAT standard.

That Congress expressly authorized cost-benefit analysis in BCT further confirms that Congress treated cost-benefit analysis as exceptional and reserved for itself the authority to decide when it would be used in the Act.  </p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court attempts to cabin its holding by suggesting that a \xe2\x80\x9crigorous form of cost-benefit analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d such as the form \xe2\x80\x9cprescribed under the statute\xe2\x80\x99s former BPT standard,\xe2\x80\x9d may not be permitted for setting BTA regulations.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  Thus the Court has effectively instructed the Agency that it can perform a cost-benefit analysis so long as it does not resemble the kind of cost-benefit analysis Congress elsewhere authorized in the CWA.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s suggested limit on the Agency\xe2\x80\x99s discretion can only be read as a concession that cost-benefit analysis, as typically performed, may be inconsistent with the BTA mandate.</p>\n<a href="#T12" name="F12">Footnote 12</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The \xe2\x80\x9cnational performance standards\xe2\x80\x9d the EPA adopted were shaped by economic efficiency concerns at the expense of finding the technology that best minimizes adverse environmental impact.  In its final rulemaking, the Agency declined to require industrial plants to adopt closed-cycle cooling technology, which by recirculating cooling water requires less water to be withdrawn and thus fewer aquatic organisms to be killed.  <em>Riverkeeper, Inc.</em> v. <em>EPA</em>, 358 F.\xc2\xa03d 174, 182, n.\xc2\xa05 (CA2 2004); 69 Fed.

The EPA instead permitted individual plants to resort to a \xe2\x80\x9csuite\xe2\x80\x9d of options so long as the method used reduced impingement and entrainment by the more modest amount of 80 and 60 percent, respectively.  See 40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(b).

And I would apply that text accordingly.  </p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 301 provides that, not later than 1977, effluent limitations for point sources shall require the application of \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best practicable</em> control technology,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7301(b)(1)(A), 86 Stat. 845 (emphasis added); and that, not later than 1983 (later extended to 1989), effluent limitations for categories and classes of point sources shall require application of the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em> technology economically achievable,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7301(b)(2)(A), <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added).

But it said nothing about comparing costs and benefits. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The final statute reflects a modification of the House\xe2\x80\x99s language with respect to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best practicable</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d and an adoption of the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s language with respect to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Conf. Rep. No. 92\xe2\x80\x931236, pp. 124\xe2\x80\x93125 (1972).  The final statute does not <em>require</em> the Agency to compare costs to benefits when determining \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em> technology,\xe2\x80\x9d but neither does it expressly <em>forbid</em> such a comparison.   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The strongest evidence in the legislative history supporting the respondents\xe2\x80\x99 position\xe2\x80\x94namely, that Congress intended to forbid comparisons of costs and benefits when determining the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em> technology\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94can be found in a written discussion of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s provisions distributed to the Senate by Senator Edmund Muskie, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s principal sponsor, when he submitted the Conference Report for the Senate\xe2\x80\x99s consideration.  118 Cong. Rec. 33693 (1972).  The relevant part of that discussion points out that, as to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best practicable</em> technology,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute requires application of a \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing test between total cost and effluent reduction benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 33696; see \xc2\xa7304(b)(1)(B).  But as to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em> technology,\xe2\x80\x9d it states: \xe2\x80\x9cWhile cost should be a factor in the Administrator\xe2\x80\x99s judgment, no balancing test will be required.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> see \xc2\xa7304(b)(2)(B).  And Senator Muskie\xe2\x80\x99s discussion later speaks of the agency \xe2\x80\x9cevaluat[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 what needs to be done\xe2\x80\x9d to eliminate pollutant discharge and \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is achievable,\xe2\x80\x9d both \xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As this language suggests, the Act\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors had reasons for minimizing the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s investigation of, and reliance upon, cost-benefit comparisons.  The preparation of formal cost-benefit analyses can take too much time, thereby delaying regulation.  And the sponsors feared that such analyses would emphasize easily quantifiable factors over more qualitative factors (particularly environmental factors, for example, the value of preserving non-marketable species of fish).  See S.\xc2\xa0Rep., at 47.  Above all, they hoped that minimizing the use of cost-benefit comparisons would force the development of cheaper control technologies; and doing so, whatever the initial inefficiencies, would eventually mean cheaper, more effective cleanup.  See <em>id.</em>, at 50\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nonetheless, neither the sponsors\xe2\x80\x99 language nor the underlying rationale requires the Act to be read in a way that would <em>forbid </em>cost-benefit comparisons.  Any such total prohibition would be difficult to enforce, for every real choice requires a decisionmaker to weigh advantages against disadvantages, and disadvantages can be seen in terms of (often quantifiable) costs.  Moreover, an absolute prohibition would bring about irrational results.  As the respondents themselves say, it would make no sense to require plants to \xe2\x80\x9cspend billions to save one more fish or plankton.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondents Riverkeeper, Inc., et\xc2\xa0al. 29.  That is so even if the industry might somehow afford those billions.  And it is particularly so in an age of limited resources available to deal with grave environmental problems, where too much wasteful expenditure devoted to one problem may well mean considerably fewer resources available to deal effectively with other (perhaps more serious) problems.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thus Senator Muskie used nuanced language, which one can read as leaving to the Agency a degree of authority to make cost-benefit comparisons in a manner that is sensitive both to the need for such comparisons and to the concerns that the law\xe2\x80\x99s sponsors expressed.  The relevant statement begins by listing various factors that the statute <em>requires</em> the Administrator to take into account when applying the phrase \xe2\x80\x9cpracticable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cclasses and categories.\xe2\x80\x9d  118 Cong. Rec. 33696.  It states that, when doing so, the Administrator <em>must</em> apply (as the statute specifies) a \xe2\x80\x9cbalancing test between total cost and effluent reduction benefits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  At the same time, it seeks to reduce the likelihood that the Administrator will place too much weight upon high costs by adding that the balancing test \xe2\x80\x9cis intended to limit the application of technology only where the additional degree of effluent reduction is wholly out of proportion to the costs of achieving\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cmarginal level of reduction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Senator Muskie\xe2\x80\x99s statement then considers the \xe2\x80\x9c<em>different test</em>\xe2\x80\x9d that the statute requires the Administrator to apply when determining the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>best available</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d technology.  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Under that test, the Administrator \xe2\x80\x9cmay consider a broader range of technological alternatives.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And in determining what is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>best available</em>\xe2\x80\x99 for a category or class, the Administrator is expected to apply the same principles involved in making the determination of \xe2\x80\x98<em>best practicable</em>\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\xa6 except as to cost-benefit analysis.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  That is, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile cost should be a factor . . . no balancing test will be <em>required</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Rather, \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[t]he Administrator will be bound by a test of reasonableness.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  The statement adds that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>best available</em>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d standard \xe2\x80\x9cis intended to reflect the need to press toward increasingly higher levels of control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  And \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasonableness of what is \xe2\x80\x98economically achievable\xe2\x80\x99 should <em>reflect</em> an evaluation of what needs to be done to move toward the elimination of the discharge of pollutants and what is achievable through the application of available technology\xe2\x80\x94without regard to cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I believe, as I said, that this language is deliberately nuanced.  The statement says that where the statute uses the term \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best practicable</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the statute <em>requires</em> comparisons of costs and benefits; but where the statute uses the term \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d such comparisons are not \xe2\x80\x9c<em>required.</em>\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  Senator Muskie does not say that all efforts to compare costs and benefits are <em>forbidden.  </em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the statement points out that where the statute uses the term \xe2\x80\x9c<em>best available</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d the Administrator \xe2\x80\x9cwill be bound by a test of <em>reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.</em> (emphasis added).  It adds that the Administrator should apply this test in a way that <em>reflects </em>its ideal objective, moving as closely as is technologically possible to the elimination of pollution.  It thereby says the Administrator should consider, <em>i.e.</em>, take into account, how much pollution would still remain if the <em>best available</em> technology were to be applied everywhere\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cwithout regard to cost.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  It does not say that the Administrator <em>must</em> set the standard based solely on the result of that determination. (It would be difficult to reconcile the alternative, more absolute reading of this language with the Senator\xe2\x80\x99s earlier \xe2\x80\x9ctest of reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x9d)</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I say that one <em>may, </em>not that one <em>must, </em>read Senator Muskie\xe2\x80\x99s statement this way.  But to read it differently would put the Agency in conflict with the test of reasonableness by threatening to impose massive costs far in excess of any benefit.  For 30 years the EPA has read the statute and its history in this way.  The EPA has thought that it would not be \xe2\x80\x9creasonable to interpret Section 316(b) as requiring use of technology whose cost is <em>wholly disproportionate</em> to the environmental benefit to be gained.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>In\xc2\xa0re Pub. Serv. Co. of N.\xc2\xa0H. (Seabrook Station, Units 1 and 2)</em>, 1 E. A. D. 332, 340 (1977), remanded on other grounds, <em>Seacoast Anti-Pollution League </em>v. <em>Costle</em>, 572 F.\xc2\xa02d 872 (CA1 1978) (emphasis added); see also <em>In\xc2\xa0re Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp., </em>EPA Decision of the General Counsel<em>,</em> NPDES Permits, No. 63, p. 371 (July 29, 1977) (also applying a \xe2\x80\x9cwholly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d test); <em>In re Pub. Serv. Co. of N.\xc2\xa0H.</em>, 1 E. A. D. 455 (1978) (same).  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]his Court will normally accord particular deference to an agency interpretation of \xe2\x80\x98longstanding\xe2\x80\x99 duration.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Barnhart </em>v.<em> Walton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/535/212/index.html">535 U. S. 212</a>, 220 (2002).  And for the last 30 years, the EPA has given the statute a permissive reading without suggesting that in doing so it was ignoring or thwarting the intent of the Congress that wrote the statute.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The EPA\xe2\x80\x99s reading of the statute would seem to permit it to describe environmental benefits in non-monetized terms and to evaluate both costs and benefits in accordance with its expert judgment and scientific knowledge.  The Agency can thereby avoid lengthy formal cost-benefit proceedings and futile attempts at comprehensive monetization, see 69 Fed. Reg. 41661\xe2\x80\x9341662; take account of Congress\xe2\x80\x99 technology-forcing objectives; and still prevent results that are absurd or unreasonable in light of extreme disparities between costs and benefits.  This approach, in my view, rests upon a \xe2\x80\x9creasonable interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of the statute\xe2\x80\x94legislative history included.  Hence it is lawful.  <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 844 (1984).<em> </em>Most of what the majority says is consistent with this view, and to that extent I agree with its opinion.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The cases before us, however, present an additional problem.  We here consider a rule that permits variances from national standards if a facility demonstrates that its costs would be \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater than the benefits of complying.\xe2\x80\x9d  40 CFR \xc2\xa7125.94(a)(5)(ii) (2008).  The words \xe2\x80\x9csignificantly greater\xe2\x80\x9d differ from the words the EPA has traditionally used to describe its standard, namely, \xe2\x80\x9cwholly disproportionate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Perhaps the EPA does not mean to make much of that difference.  But if it means the new words to set forth a new and different test, the EPA must adequately explain why it has changed its standard.  <em>Motor Vehicle Mfrs. Assn. of United States, Inc.</em> v. <em>State Farm Mut. Automobile Ins. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/463/29/index.html">463 U. S. 29</a>, 42\xe2\x80\x9343 (1983); <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 981 (2005); <em>Thomas Jefferson Univ.</em> v. <em>Shalala</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/504/index.html">512 U. S. 504</a>, 524, n. 3 (1994) (Thomas, J., dissenting).  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I am not convinced the EPA has successfully explained the basis for the change.  It has referred to the fact that existing facilities have less flexibility than new facilities with respect to installing new technologies, and it has pointed to special, energy-related impacts of regulation.  68 Fed. Reg. 13541 (2003) (proposed rule).  But it has not explained why the traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwholly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d standard cannot do the job now, when the EPA has used that standard (for existing facilities and otherwise) with apparent success in the past.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Central Hudson</em>, <em>supra</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Consequently, like the majority, I would remand these cases to the Court of Appeals.  But unlike the majority I would permit that court to remand the cases to the EPA so that the EPA can either apply its traditional \xe2\x80\x9cwholly disproportionate\xe2\x80\x9d standard or provide an adequately reasoned explanation for the change.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></div>'
