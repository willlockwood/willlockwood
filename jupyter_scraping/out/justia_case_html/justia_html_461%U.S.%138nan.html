Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html">391 U. S. 563</a></span> (1968), we stated that a public employee does not relinquish First Amendment rights to comment on matters of public interest by virtue of government employment.  We also recognized that the State\'s interests as an employer in regulating the speech of its employees "differ significantly from those it possesses in connection with regulation of the speech of the citizenry in general."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#568">391 U.

The problem, we thought, was arriving</p>\n<p>"at a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  We return to this problem today and consider whether the First and Fourteenth Amendments prevent the discharge of a state employee for circulating a questionnaire concerning internal office affairs.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The respondent, Sheila Myers, was employed as an Assistant District Attorney in New Orleans for five and a half years.  She served at the pleasure of petitioner Harry Connick, the District Attorney for Orleans Parish.  During this period, Myers competently performed her responsibilities of trying criminal cases.</p>\n<p>In the early part of October, 1980, Myers was informed that she would be transferred to prosecute cases in a different section of the criminal court. Myers was strongly opposed to the proposed transfer [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] and expressed her view to several of her supervisors, including Connick.  Despite her objections, on October 6, Myers was notified that she was being transferred.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="141">Page 461 U. S. 141</a></p><p> Myers again spoke with Dennis Waldron, one of the First Assistant District Attorneys, expressing her reluctance to accept the transfer.  A number of other office matters were discussed, and Myers later testified that, in response to Waldron\'s suggestion that her concerns were not shared by others in the office, she informed him that she would do some research on the matter.</p>\n<p>That night, Myers prepared a questionnaire soliciting the views of her fellow staff members concerning office transfer policy, office morale, the need for a grievance committee, the level of confidence in supervisors, and whether employees felt pressured to work in political campaigns. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Early the following morning, Myers typed and copied the questionnaire.  She also met with Connick, who urged her to accept the transfer.  She said she would "consider" it.  Connick then left the office.  Myers then distributed the questionnaire to 15 Assistant District Attorneys.  Shortly after noon, Dennis Waldron learned that Myers was distributing the survey.  He immediately phoned Connick and informed him that Myers was creating a "mini-insurrection" within the office.  Connick returned to the office and told Myers that she was being terminated because of her refusal to accept the transfer.  She was also told that her distribution of the questionnaire was considered an act of insubordination.  Connick particularly objected to the question which inquired whether employees "had confidence in and would rely on the word" of various superiors in the office, and to a question concerning pressure to work in political campaigns which he felt would be damaging if discovered by the press.</p>\n<p>Myers filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 (1976 ed., Supp. V), contending that her employment was wrongfully terminated because she had exercised her constitutionally protected right of free speech.  The District Court agreed, ordered Myers reinstated, and awarded backpay, damages, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="142">Page 461 U. S. 142</a></p><p> attorney\'s fees.  507 F.Supp. 752 (ED La.1981). [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The District Court found that, although Connick informed Myers that she was being fired because of her refusal to accept a transfer, the facts showed that the questionnaire was the real reason for her termination.  The court then proceeded to hold that Myers\' questionnaire involved matters of public concern, and that the State had not "clearly demonstrated" that the survey "substantially interfered" with the operations of the District Attorney\'s office.</p>\n<p>Connick appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which affirmed on the basis of the District Court\'s opinion.  654 F.2d 719 (1981).  Connick then sought review in this Court by way of certiorari, which we granted.  455 U.S. 999 (1982).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>For at least 15 years, it has been settled that a State cannot condition public employment on a basis that infringes the employee\'s constitutionally protected interest in freedom of expression.  <em>Keyishian v.

Our task, as we defined it in <em>Pickering,</em> is to seek</p>\n<p>"a balance between the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."</p>\n<p>391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#568">391 U. S. 568</a></span>.  The District Court, and thus the Court of Appeals as well, misapplied our decision in <em>Pickering,</em> and consequently, in our view, erred in striking the balance for respondent. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="143">Page 461 U. S. 143</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>A\n</em></p>\n<p>The District Court got off on the wrong foot in this case by initially finding that,</p>\n<p>"[t]aken as a whole, the issues presented in the questionnaire relate to the effective functioning of the District Attorney\'s Office and are matters of public importance and concern."</p>\n<p>507 F.Supp. at 758.  Connick contends at the outset that no balancing of interests is required in this case, because Myers\' questionnaire concerned only internal office matters, and that such speech is not upon a matter of "public concern," as the term was used in <em>Pickering.</em>  Although we do not agree that Myers\' communication in this case was wholly without First Amendment protection, there is much force to Connick\'s submission.  The repeated emphasis in <em>Pickering</em> on the right of a public employee "as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern," was not accidental.  This language, reiterated in all of <em>Pickering\'s</em> progeny, [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] reflects both the historical evolvement of the rights of public employees and the common-sense realization that government offices could not function if every employment decision became a constitutional matter. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>For most of this century, the unchallenged dogma was that a public employee had no right to object to conditions placed upon the terms of employment -- including those which restricted the exercise of constitutional rights.  The classic formulation of this position was that of Justice Holmes, who, when sitting on the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, observed:  "[A policeman] may have a constitutional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="144">Page 461 U. S. 144</a></p><p> right to talk politics, but he has no constitutional right to be a policeman."  <em>McAuliffe v. Mayor of New Bedford,</em> 155 Mass. 216, 220, 29 N.E. 517, 517 (1892).  For many years, Holmes\' epigram expressed this Court\'s law.  <em>Adler v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/342/485/case.html">342 U.

S. 371</a></span> (1882).</p>\n<p>The Court cast new light on the matter in a series of cases arising from the widespread efforts in the 1950\'s and early 1960\'s to require public employees, particularly teachers, to swear oaths of loyalty to the State and reveal the groups with which they associated.  In <em>Wiemann v. Updegraff,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/344/183/case.html">344 U. S. 183</a></span> (1952), the Court held that a State could not require its employees to establish their loyalty by extracting an oath denying past affiliation with Communists.  In <em>Cafeteria Workers v. McElroy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/367/886/case.html">367 U. S. 886</a></span> (1961), the Court recognized that the government could not deny employment because of previous membership in a particular party.  <em>See also Shelton v.

Board of Public Instruction,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/368/278/case.html">368 U. S. 278</a></span> (1961).  By the time <em>Sherbert v. Verner,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html">374 U. S. 398</a></span> (1963), was decided, it was already</p>\n<p>"too late in the day to doubt that the liberties of religion and expression may be infringed by the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit or privilege."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/398/case.html#404">374 U. S. 404</a></span>.  It was therefore no surprise when, in <em>Keyishian v. Board of Regents, supra,</em> the Court invalidated New York statutes barring employment on the basis of membership in "subversive" organizations, observing that the theory that public employment which may be denied altogether may be subjected to any conditions, regardless of how unreasonable, had been uniformly rejected.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/589/case.html#605">385 U. S. 605</a></span>-606.</p>\n<p>In all of these cases, the precedents in which <em>Pickering</em> is rooted, the invalidated statutes and actions sought to suppress the rights of public employees to participate in public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="145">Page 461 U. S. 145</a></p><p> affairs.  The issue was whether government employees could be prevented or "chilled" by the fear of discharge from joining political parties and other associations that certain public officials might find "subversive."  The explanation for the Constitution\'s special concern with threats to the right of citizens to participate in political affairs is no mystery.  The First Amendment "was fashioned to assure unfettered interchange of ideas for the bringing about of political and social changes desired by the people."  <em>Roth v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/354/476/case.html">354 U.

S. 74</a></span>-75 (1964).  Accordingly, the Court has frequently reaffirmed that speech on public issues occupies the "<em>highest rung of the heirarchy of First Amendment values,\'" and is entitled to special protection.  <em>NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/886/case.html">458 U.

In <em>Pickering,</em> the Court held impermissible under the First Amendment the dismissal of a high school teacher for openly criticizing the Board of Education on its allocation of school funds between athletics and education and its methods of informing taxpayers about the need for additional revenue.  <em>Pickering\'s</em> subject was "a matter of legitimate public concern" upon which "free and open debate is vital to informed decisionmaking by the electorate."  391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#571">391 U.

Sindermann,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/593/case.html">408 U. S. 593</a></span> (1972), arose from the failure to rehire a teacher in the state college system who had testified before committees of the Texas Legislature and had become involved in public disagreement over whether the college should be elevated to 4-year status -- a change opposed by the Regents.  In <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">Mt. Healthy City Board of Ed. v.</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="146">Page 461 U. S. 146</a></p><p> <em>Doyle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">429 U. S. 274</a></span> (1977), a public school teacher was not rehired because, allegedly, he had relayed to a radio .station the substance of a memorandum relating to teacher dress and appearance that the school principal had circulated to various teachers. The memorandum was apparently prompted by the view of some in the administration that there was a relationship between teacher appearance and public support for bond issues, and indeed, the radio station promptly announced the adoption of the dress code as a news item.  Most recently, in <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html">439 U. S. 410</a></span> (1979), we held that First Amendment protection applies when a public employee arranges to communicate privately with his employer, rather than to express his views publicly.  Although the subject matter of Mrs. Givhan\'s statements were not the issue before the Court, it is clear that her statements concerning the School District\'s allegedly racially discriminatory policies involved a matter of public concern.</p>\n<p><em>Pickering,</em> its antecedents, and its progeny lead us to conclude that, if Myers\' questionnaire cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  When employee expression cannot be fairly considered as relating to any matter of political, social, or other concern to the community, government officials should enjoy wide latitude in managing their offices, without intrusive oversight by the judiciary in the name of the First Amendment.  Perhaps the government employer\'s dismissal of the worker may not be fair, but ordinary dismissals from government service which violate no fixed tenure or applicable statute or regulation are not subject to judicial review even if the reasons for the dismissal are alleged to be mistaken or unreasonable.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="147">Page 461 U.

Illinois Bar Assn.,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/389/217/case.html">389 U.

We in no sense suggest that speech on private matters falls into one of the narrow and well-defined classes of expression which carries so little social value, such as obscenity, that the State can prohibit and punish such expression by all persons in its jurisdiction.  <em>See Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/315/568/case.html">315 U. S. 568</a></span> (1942); <em>Roth v. United States, supra; New York v. Ferber,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/458/747/case.html">458 U. S. 747</a></span> (1982).  For example, an employee\'s false criticism of his employer on grounds not of public concern may be cause for his discharge, but would be entitled to the same protection in a libel action accorded an identical statement made by a man on the street.  We hold only that, when a public employee speaks not as a citizen upon matters of public concern, but instead as an employee upon matters only of personal interest, absent the most unusual circumstances, a federal court is not the appropriate forum in which to review the wisdom of a personnel decision taken by a public agency allegedly in reaction to the employee\'s behavior.  <em>Cf. Bishop v. Wood, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/426/341/case.html#349">426 U. S. 349</a></span>-350.  Our responsibility is to ensure that citizens are not deprived of fundamental rights by virtue of working for the government; this does not require a grant of immunity for employee grievances not afforded by the First Amendment to those who do not work for the State.</p>\n<p>Whether an employee\'s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context </p><p><a class="page-number" name="148">Page 461 U. S. 148</a></p><p> of a given statement, as revealed by the whole record. [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]  In this case, with but one exception, the questions posed by Myers to her coworkers do not fall under the rubric of matters of "public concern."  We view the questions pertaining to the confidence and trust that Myers\' coworkers possess in various supervisors, the level of office morale, and the need for a grievance committee as mere extensions of Myers\' dispute over her transfer to another section of the criminal court.  Unlike the dissent, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#163">461 U. S. 163</a></span>, we do not believe these questions are of public import in evaluating the performance of the District Attorney as an elected official.  Myers did not seek to inform the public that the District Attorney\'s Office was not discharging its governmental responsibilities in the investigation and prosecution of criminal cases.  Nor did Myers seek to bring to light actual or potential wrongdoing or breach of public trust on the part of Connick and others.  Indeed, the questionnaire, if released to the public, would convey no information at all other than the fact that a single employee is upset with the <em>status quo.</em>  While discipline and morale in the workplace are related to an agency\'s efficient performance of its duties, the focus of Myers\' questions is not to evaluate the performance of the office, but rather to gather ammunition for another round of controversy with her superiors.  These questions reflect one employee\'s dissatisfaction with a transfer and an attempt to turn that displeasure into a <em>cause celebre.</em> [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="149">Page 461 U. S. 149</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To presume that all matters which transpire within a government office are of public concern would mean that virtually every remark -- and certainly every criticism directed at a public official -- would plant the seed of a constitutional case.  While, as a matter of good judgment, public officials should be receptive to constructive criticism offered by their employees, the First Amendment does not require a public office to be run as a roundtable for employee complaints over internal office affairs.</p>\n<p>One question in Myers\' questionnaire, however, does touch upon a matter of public concern.  Question 11 inquires if assistant district attorneys "ever feel pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office supported candidates."  We have recently noted that official pressure upon employees to work for political candidates not of the worker\'s own choice constitutes a coercion of belief in violation of fundamental constitutional rights.  <em>Branti v. Finkel,</em> 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/507/case.html#515">445 U. S. 515</a></span>-516; <em>Elrod v. Burns,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/347/case.html">427 U. S. 347</a></span> (1976).  In addition, there is a demonstrated interest in this country that government service should depend upon meritorious performance, rather than political service.  <em>CSC v. Letter Carriers,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/548/case.html">413 U. S. 548</a></span> (1973); <em>Public Workers v. Mitchell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/75/case.html">330 U. S. 75</a></span> (1947).  Given this history, we believe it apparent that the issue of whether assistant district attorneys are pressured to work in political campaigns is a matter of interest to the community upon which it is essential that public employees be able to speak out freely without fear of retaliatory dismissal.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Because one of the questions in Myers\' survey touched upon a matter of public concern and contributed to her discharge, we must determine whether Connick was justified in discharging Myers.  Here the District Court again erred in imposing an unduly onerous burden on the State to justify </p><p><a class="page-number" name="150">Page 461 U. S. 150</a></p><p> Myers\' discharge.  The District Court viewed the issue of whether Myers\' speech was upon a matter of "public concern" as a threshold inquiry, after which it became the government\'s burden to "clearly demonstrate" that the speech involved "substantially interfered" with official responsibilities.  Yet <em>Pickering</em> unmistakably states, and respondent agrees, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] that the State\'s burden in justifying a particular discharge varies depending upon the nature of the employee\'s expression.  Although such particularized balancing is difficult, the courts must reach the most appropriate possible balance of the competing interests. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>The <em>Pickering</em> balance requires full consideration of the government\'s interest in the effective and efficient fulfillment of its responsibilities to the public.  One hundred years ago, the Court noted the government\'s legitimate purpose in</p>\n<p>"promot[ing] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="151">Page 461 U. S. 151</a></p><p> efficiency and integrity in the discharge of official duties, and [in] maintain[ing] proper discipline in the public service."</p>\n<p><em>Ex parte Curtis,</em> 106 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/106/371/case.html#373">106 U. S. 373</a></span>.  As JUSTICE POWELL explained in his separate opinion in <em>Arnett v. Kennedy,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/134/case.html">416 U. S. 134</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/416/134/case.html#168">416 U. S. 168</a></span> (1974):</p>\n<p>"To this end, the Government, as an employer, must have wide discretion and control over the management of its personnel and internal affairs.  This includes the prerogative to remove employees whose conduct hinders efficient operation, and to do so with dispatch.  Prolonged retention of a disruptive or otherwise unsatisfactory employee can adversely affect discipline and morale in the work place, foster disharmony, and ultimately impair the efficiency of an office or agency."</p>\n<p>We agree with the District Court that there is no demonstration here that the questionnaire impeded Myers\' ability to perform her responsibilities.  The District Court was also correct to recognize that</p>\n<p>"it is important to the efficient and successful operation of the District Attorney\'s office for Assistants to maintain close working relationships with their superiors."</p>\n<p>507 F.Supp. at 759.  Connick\'s judgment, and apparently also that of his first assistant Dennis Waldron, who characterized Myers\' actions as causing a "mini-insurrection," was that Myers\' questionnaire was an act of insubordination which interfered with working relationships. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  When close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public </p><p><a class="page-number" name="152">Page 461 U. S. 152</a></p><p> responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer\'s judgment is appropriate.  Furthermore, we do not see the necessity for an employer to allow events to unfold to the extent that the disruption of the office and the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  We caution that a stronger showing may be necessary if the employee\'s speech more substantially involved matters of public concern.</p>\n<p>The District Court rejected Connick\'s position because,</p>\n<p>"[u]nlike a statement of fact which might be deemed critical of one\'s superiors, [Myers\'] questionnaire was not a statement of fact, but the presentation and solicitation of ideas and opinions,"</p>\n<p>which are entitled to greater constitutional protection because, "<em>under the First Amendment, there is no such thing as a false idea.\'"  <em>Ibid.</em>  This approach, while perhaps relevant in weighing the value of Myers\' speech, bears no logical relationship to the issue of whether the questionnaire undermined office relationships.  Questions, no less than forcefully stated opinions and facts, carry messages and it requires no unusual insight to conclude that the purpose, if not the likely result, of the questionnaire is to seek to precipitate a vote of no confidence in Connick and his supervisors.  Thus, Question 10, which asked whether or not the Assistants had confidence in and relied on the word of five named supervisors, is a statement that carries the clear potential for undermining office relations.\n</em></p>\n<p>Also relevant is the manner, time, and place in which the questionnaire was distributed.  As noted in <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html#415">439 U. S. 415</a></span>, n. 4:</p>\n<p>"Private expression . . . may in some situations bring additional </p><p><a class="page-number" name="153">Page 461 U. S. 153</a></p><p> factors to the <em>Pickering</em> calculus.  When a government employee personally confronts his immediate superior, the employing agency\'s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the employee\'s message, but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered."</p>\n<p>Here the questionnaire was prepared and distributed at the office; the manner of distribution required not only Myers to leave her work, but others to do the same in order that the questionnaire be completed. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  Although some latitude in when official work is performed is to be allowed when professional employees are involved, and Myers did not violate announced office policy, [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>] the fact that Myers, unlike Pickering, exercised her rights to speech at the office supports Connick\'s fears that the functioning of his office was endangered.</p>\n<p>Finally, the context in which the dispute arose is also significant.  This is not a case where an employee, out of purely academic interest, circulated a questionnaire so as to obtain useful research.  Myers acknowledges that it is no coincidence that the questionnaire followed upon the heels of the transfer notice.  When employee speech concerning office policy arises from an employment dispute concerning the very application of that policy to the speaker, additional weight must be given to the supervisor\'s view that the employee has threatened the authority of the employer to run the office.  Although we accept the District Court\'s factual finding that Myers\' reluctance to accede to the transfer order was not a sufficient cause in itself for her dismissal, and thus does not constitute a sufficient defense under <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">Mt. Healthy</a></span></em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="154">Page 461 U. S. 154</a></p><p> <em>City Board of Ed. v. Doyle,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/274/case.html">429 U. S. 274</a></span> (1977), this does not render irrelevant the fact that the questionnaire emerged after a persistent dispute between Myers and Connick and his deputies over office transfer policy.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Myers\' questionnaire touched upon matters of public concern in only a most limited sense; her survey, in our view, is most accurately characterized as an employee grievance concerning internal office policy.  The limited First Amendment interest involved here does not require that Connick tolerate action which he reasonably believed would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy close working relationships.  Myers\' discharge therefore did not offend the First Amendment.  We reiterate, however, the caveat we expressed in <em>Pickering,</em> 391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#569">391 U. S. 569</a></span>:</p>\n<p>"Because of the enormous variety of fact situations in which critical statements by . . . public employees may be thought by their superiors . . . to furnish grounds for dismissal, we do not deem it either appropriate or feasible to attempt to lay down a general standard against which all such statements may be judged."</p>\n<p>Our holding today is grounded in our longstanding recognition that the First Amendment\'s primary aim is the full protection of speech upon issues of public concern, as well as the practical realities involved in the administration of a government office.  Although today the balance is struck for the government, this is no defeat for the First Amendment.  For it would indeed be a Pyrrhic victory for the great principles of free expression if the Amendment\'s safeguarding of a public employee\'s right, as a citizen, to participate in discussions concerning public affairs were confused with the attempt to constitutionalize the employee grievance that we see presented here.

The Court concludes that her dismissal does not violate the First Amendment, primarily because the questionnaire addresses matters that, in the Court\'s view, are not of public concern.  It is hornbook law, however, that speech about "the manner in which government is operated or should be operated" is an essential part of the communications necessary for self-governance the protection of which was a central purpose of the First Amendment.  <em>Mills v.

S. 568</a></span>.  We recognized, however, that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="157">Page 461 U. S. 157</a></p><p> government has legitimate interests in regulating the speech of its employees that differ significantly from its interests in regulating the speech of people generally.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We therefore held that the scope of public employees\' First Amendment rights must be determined by balancing</p>\n<p>"the interests of the [employee], as a citizen, in commenting upon matters of public concern and the interest of the State, as an employer, in promoting the efficiency of the public services it performs through its employees."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em></p>\n<p>The balancing test articulated in <em>Pickering</em> comes into play only when a public employee\'s speech implicates the government\'s interests as an employer.  When public employees engage in expression unrelated to their employment while away from the workplace, their First Amendment rights are, of course, no different from those of the general public.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#574">391 U.

Thus, whether a public employee\'s speech addresses a matter of public concern is relevant to the constitutional inquiry only when the statements at issue -- by virtue of their content or the context in which they were made -- may have an adverse impact on the government\'s ability to perform its duties efficiently. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The Court\'s decision today is flawed in three respects.  First, the Court distorts the balancing analysis required under <em>Pickering</em> by suggesting that one factor, the context in which a statement is made, is to be weighed twice -- first in </p><p><a class="page-number" name="158">Page 461 U.

Second, in concluding that the effect of respondent\'s personnel policies on employee morale and the work performance of the District Attorney\'s Office is not a matter of public concern, the Court impermissibly narrows the class of subjects on which public employees may speak out without fear of retaliatory dismissal.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html">461 U. S. 148</a></span>-149.  Third, the Court misapplies the <em>Pickering</em> balancing test in holding that Myers could constitutionally be dismissed for circulating a questionnaire addressed to at least one subject that was "a matter of interest to the community," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#149">461 U. S. 149</a></span>, in the absence of evidence that her conduct disrupted the efficient functioning of the District Attorney\'s Office.</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The District Court summarized the contents of respondent\'s questionnaire as follows:</p>\n<p>"Plaintiff solicited the views of her fellow Assistant District Attorneys on a number of issues, including office transfer policies and the manner in which information of that nature was communicated within the office.  The questionnaire also sought to determine the views of Assistants regarding office morale, the need for a grievance committee, and the level of confidence felt by the Assistants for their supervisors.  Finally, the questionnaire inquired as to whether the Assistants felt pressured to work in political campaigns on behalf of office-supported candidates."</p>\n<p>507 F.Supp. 752, 758 (ED La.1981).</p>\n<p>After reviewing the evidence, the District Court found that,</p>\n<p>"[t]aken as a whole, the issues presented in the questionnaire relate to the effective functioning of the District Attorney\'s Office, and are matters of public importance and concern."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> The Court of Appeals affirmed on the basis of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="159">Page 461 U. S. 159</a></p><p> the District Court\'s findings and conclusions.  654 F.2d 719 (CA5 1981).  The Court nonetheless concludes that Myers\' questions about the effect of petitioner\'s personnel policies on employee morale and overall work performance are not "of public import in evaluating the performance of the District Attorney as an elected official."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#148">461 U.

In so doing, it announces the following standard:</p>\n<p>"Whether an employee\'s speech addresses a matter of public concern must be determined by the content, form, and context of a given statement. . . ."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#147">461 U. S. 147</a></span>-148.</p>\n<p>The standard announced by the Court suggests that the manner and context in which a statement is made must be weighed on both sides of the <em>Pickering</em> balance.  It is beyond dispute that how and where a public employee expresses his views are relevant in the second half of the <em>Pickering</em> inquiry -- determining whether the employee\'s speech adversely affects the government\'s interests as an employer.  The Court explicitly acknowledged this in <em>Givhan v. Western Line Consolidated School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html">439 U. S. 410</a></span> (1979), where we stated that, when a public employee speaks privately to a supervisor,</p>\n<p>"the employing agency\'s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the . . . message but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html#415">439 U. S. 415</a></span>, n. 4.  But the fact that a public employee has chosen to express his views in private has nothing whatsoever to do with the first half of the <em>Pickering</em> calculus -- whether those views relate to a matter of public concern.  This conclusion is implicit in <em>Givhan\'s</em> holding that the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment is not "lost to the public employee who arranges to communicate privately with his employer rather than to spread his views before the public."  439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html#415">439 U. S. 415</a></span>-416.</p>\n<p>The Court seeks to distinguish <em>Givhan</em> on the ground that speech protesting racial discrimination is "inherently of public concern."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#148">461 U. S. 148</a></span>, n. 8.  In so doing, it suggests that there are two classes of speech of public concern:  statements "of public import" because of their content, form, and context, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="160">Page 461 U. S. 160</a></p><p> and statements that, by virtue of their subject matter, are "inherently of public concern."  In my view, however, whether a particular statement by a public employee is addressed to a subject of public concern does not depend on where it was said or why.  The First Amendment affords special protection to speech that may inform public debate about how our society is to be governed -- regardless of whether it actually becomes the subject of a public controversy.

The questionnaire sought primarily to obtain information about the impact of the recent transfers on morale in the District Attorney\'s Office.  It is beyond doubt that personnel decisions that adversely affect discipline and morale may ultimately impair an agency\'s efficient performance of its duties.  <em>See Arnett v.

[<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  But deciding whether a particular matter is of public concern is an inquiry that, by its very nature, is a sensitive one for judges charged with interpreting a constitutional provision intended to put "the decision as to what views shall be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="164">Page 461 U.

To the contrary, the First Amendment protects the dissemination of such information so that the people, not the courts, may evaluate its usefulness.  The proper means to ensure that the courts are not swamped with routine employee grievances mischaracterized as First Amendment cases is not to restrict artificially the concept of "public concern," but to require that adequate weight be given to the public\'s important interests in the efficient performance of governmental functions and in preserving employee discipline and harmony sufficient to achieve that end.  <em>See</em> Part  <span class="l-normal"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#166">461 U.

In addition, in <em>Givhan,</em> we recognized that, when the statements in question are made in private to an employee\'s immediate supervisor,</p>\n<p>"the employing agency\'s institutional efficiency may be threatened not only by the content of the . . . message, but also by the manner, time, and place in which it is delivered."</p>\n<p>439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/410/case.html#415">439 U.

It found that petitioner failed to establish that Myers violated either a duty of confidentiality or an office policy.  507 F, Supp. at 758-759.  Noting that most of the copies of the questionnaire were distributed during lunch, it rejected the contention that the distribution of the questionnaire impeded Myers\' performance of her duties, and it concluded that "Connick has not shown <em>any</em> evidence to indicate that the plaintiff\'s work performance was adversely affected by her expression."  <em>Id.</em> at 754-755, 759 (emphasis supplied).</p>\n<p>The Court accepts all of these findings.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#151">461 U. S. 151</a></span>.  It concludes, however, that the District Court failed to give adequate weight to the context in which the questionnaire was distributed and to the need to maintain close working relationships in the District Attorney\'s Office.  In particular, the Court suggests the District Court failed to give sufficient weight to the disruptive potential of Question 10, which asked whether the Assistants had confidence in the word of five named supervisors.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#152">461 U. S. 152</a></span>.  The District Court, however, explicitly recognized that this was petitioner\'s "most forceful argument"; but after hearing the testimony of four of the five supervisors named in the question, it found that the question had no adverse effect on Myers\' relationship with her superiors.  507 F.Supp. at 759. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="168">Page 461 U. S. 168</a></p><p></p>\n<p>To this the Court responds that an employer need not wait until the destruction of working relationships is manifest before taking action.  In the face of the District Court\'s finding that the circulation of the questionnaire had no disruptive effect, the Court holds that respondent may be dismissed because petitioner "reasonably believed [the action] would disrupt the office, undermine his authority, and destroy close working relationships."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#154">461 U. S. 154</a></span>.  Even though the District Court found that the distribution of the questionnaire did not impair Myers\' working relationship with her supervisors, the Court bows to petitioner\'s judgment because,</p>\n<p>"[w]hen close working relationships are essential to fulfilling public responsibilities, a wide degree of deference to the employer\'s judgment is appropriate."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#151">461 U. S. 151</a></span>-152.</p>\n<p>Such extreme deference to the employer\'s judgment is not appropriate when public employees voice critical views concerning the operations of the agency for which they work.  Although an employer\'s determination that an employee\'s statements have undermined essential working relationships must be carefully weighed in the <em>Pickering</em> balance, we must bear in mind that "the threat of dismissal from public employment is . . . a potent means of inhibiting speech."  <em>Pickering,</em> 391 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/391/563/case.html#574">391 U. S. 574</a></span>.  <em>See Keyishian v. Board of Regents,</em> 385 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/589/case.html#604">385 U. S. 604</a></span>.  If the employer\'s judgment is to be controlling, public employees will not speak out when what they have to say is critical of their supervisors.  In order to protect public employees\' First Amendment right to voice critical views on issues of public importance, the courts must make their own appraisal of the effects of the speech in question.</p>\n<p>In this regard, our decision in <em>Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/case.html">393 U. S. 503</a></span> (1969), is controlling.  <em>Tinker</em> arose in a public school, a context similar to the one in which the present case arose in that the determination of the scope of the Constitution\'s guarantee of freedom of speech required consideration of the "special </p><p><a class="page-number" name="169">Page 461 U. S. 169</a></p><p> characteristics of the . . . environment" in which the expression took place.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/case.html#506">393 U. S. 506</a></span>.  At issue was whether public high school students could constitutionally be prohibited from wearing black armbands in school to express their opposition to the Vietnam conflict.  The District Court had ruled that such a ban "was reasonable because it was based upon [school officials\'] fear of a disturbance from the wearing of armbands."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/case.html#508">393 U. S. 508</a></span>.  We found that justification inadequate, because, "in our system, undifferentiated fear or apprehension of disturbance is not enough to overcome the right to freedom of expression."  <em>Ibid.</em>  We concluded:</p>\n<p>"In order for the State . . . to justify prohibition of a particular expression of opinion, it must be able to show that its action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint.  <em>Certainly where there is no finding and no showing that engaging in the forbidden</em> conduct would \'materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school,\' the prohibition cannot be sustained."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/503/case.html#509">393 U. S. 509</a></span> (emphasis supplied) (quoting <em>Burnside v. Byars,</em> 363 F.2d 744, 749 (CA5 1966)).</p>\n<p>Because the speech at issue addressed matters of public importance, a similar standard should be applied here.  After reviewing the evidence, the District Court found that</p>\n<p>"it cannot be said that the defendant\'s interest in promoting the efficiency of the public services performed through his employees was either adversely affected or substantially impeded by plaintiff\'s distribution of the questionnaire."</p>\n<p>507 F.Supp. at 759.  Based on these findings, the District Court concluded that the circulation of the questionnaire was protected by the First Amendment.  The District Court applied the proper legal standard and reached an acceptable accommodation between the competing interests.  I would affirm its decision and the judgment of the Court of Appeals. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="170">Page 461 U.

As a result, the public will be deprived of valuable information with which to evaluate the performance of elected officials.  Because protecting the dissemination of such information is an essential function of the First Amendment, I dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Court\'s opinion states that,</p>\n<p>"if Myers\' questionnaire cannot be fairly characterized as constituting speech on a matter of public concern, it is unnecessary for us to scrutinize the reasons for her discharge,"</p>\n<p><em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#146">461 U. S. 146</a></span> (footnote omitted), I do not understand it to imply that a governmental employee\'s First Amendment rights outside the employment context are limited to speech on matters of public concern.  To the extent that the Court\'s opinion may be read to suggest that the dismissal of a public employee for speech unrelated to a subject of public interest does not implicate First Amendment interests, I disagree, because our cases establish that public employees enjoy the full range of First Amendment rights guaranteed to members of the general public.  Under the balancing test articulated in <em>Pickering,</em> however, the government\'s burden to justify such a dismissal may be lighter.  <em>See</em> <l=|461 138fn2="" 4|="" u.s.="">n. 4, <em>infra.</em></l=|461></p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/2" name="F2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the parties offered no evidence on whether the subjects addressed by the questionnaire were, in fact, matters of public concern, extensive local press coverage shows that the issues involved are of interest to the people of Orleans Parish.  Shortly after the District Court took the case under advisement, a major daily newspaper in New Orleans carried a 7-paragraph story describing the questionnaire, the events leading to Myers\' dismissal, and the filing of this action.  The Times-Picayune/The States-Item, Dec. 6, 1980, section 1, p. 21, col. 1.  The same newspaper also carried a 16-paragraph story when the District Court ruled in Myers\' favor, Feb. 11, 1981, section 1, p. 15, col. 2; a 14-paragraph story when the Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court\'s decision, July 28, 1981, section 1, p. 11, col. 1; a 12-paragraph story when this Court granted Connick\'s petition for certiorari, Mar. 9, 1982, section 1, p. 15, col. 5.; and a 17-paragraph story when we heard oral argument, Nov. 9, 1982, section 1, p. 13, col. 5.</p>\n<p>In addition, matters affecting the internal operations of the Orleans Parish District Attorney\'s Office often receive extensive coverage in the same newspaper.  For example, The Times-Picayune/The States-Item carried a lengthy story reporting that the agency moved to "plush new offices," and describing in detail the "privacy problem" faced by Assistant District Attorneys because the office was unable to obtain modular furniture with which to partition its new space.  Jan. 25, 1981, section 8, p. 13, col. 1.  It also carried a 16-paragraph story when a committee of the Louisiana State Senate voted to prohibit petitioner from retaining a public relations specialist.  July 9, 1982, section 1, p. 14, col. 1.</p>\n<p>In light of the public\'s interest in the operations of the District Attorney\'s Office in general, and in the dispute between the parties in particular, it is quite possible that, contrary to the Court\'s view, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#148">461 U. S. 148</a></span>-149, Myers\' comments concerning morale and working conditions in the office would actually have engaged the public\'s attention had she stated them publicly.  Moreover, as a general matter, the media frequently carry news stories reporting that personnel policies in effect at a government agency have resulted in declining employee morale and deteriorating agency performance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/3" name="F2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]</p>\n<p>Perhaps the simplest example of a statement by a public employee that would not be protected by the First Amendment would be answering "No" to a request that the employee perform a lawful task within the scope of his duties.  Although such a refusal is "speech," which implicates First Amendment interests, it is also insubordination, and as such it may serve as the basis for a lawful dismissal.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/4" name="F2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]</p>\n<p>Indeed, it has been suggested that</p>\n<p>"a classification that bases the right to First Amendment protection on some estimate of how much general interest there is in the communication is surely in conflict with the whole idea of the First Amendment."</p>\n<p>T. Emerson, The System of Freedom of Expression 554 (1970).  The degree to which speech is of interest to the public may be relevant in determining whether a public employer may constitutionally be required to tolerate some degree of disruption resulting from its utterance.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/138/case.html#152">461 U. S. 152</a></span>.  In general, however, whether a government employee\'s speech is of "public concern" must be determined by reference to the broad conception of the First Amendment\'s guarantee of freedom of speech found necessary by the Framers</p>\n<p>"to supply the public need for information and education with respect to the significant issues of the times. . . .  Freedom of discussion, if it would fulfill its historic function in this nation, must embrace all issues about which information is needed or appropriate to enable the members of society to cope with the exigencies of their period."</p>\n<p><em>Thornhill v.

In that action, Hill had sought damages resulting from the publication of an allegedly false report that a new play portrayed the experience of him and his family when they were held hostage in their home in a publicized incident years earlier.  We entertained "no doubt that . . . the opening of a new play linked to an actual incident, is a matter of public interest."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/385/374/case.html#388">385 U.

Our discussion in <em>Time, Inc. v.
