S. 456</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>In September, 1976, Kentucky inmates brought a federal class action under 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 1983 challenging conditions of confinement in the Kentucky State Penitentiary at Eddyville.  Other cases, one of them relating to the Kentucky State Reformatory at La Grange, were consolidated with the one concerning the penitentiary.  The litigation was settled by a consent decree dated 28 May, 1980, and supplemented 22 July, 1980, containing provisions governing a broad range of prison conditions.  App. 2-44, 45-55.  <em>See Kendrick v. Bland,</em> 541 F.Supp. 21, 27-50 (WD Ky.1981); <em>see also Kendrick v. Bland,</em> 740 F.2d 432 (CA6 1984).  Of sole relevance here, the consent decree provides:</p>\n<p>"The Bureau of Corrections encourages and agrees to maintain visitation at least at the current level, with minimal restrictions,\' and to \'continue [its] open visiting policy."</p>\n<p><em>See</em> 541 F.Supp. at 37.</p>\n<p>The Commonwealth in 1981 issued "Corrections Policies and Procedures" governing general prison visitation, including a nonexhaustive list of visitors who may be excluded. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Four years later, the reformatory issued its own more detailed </p><p><a class="page-number" name="457">Page 490 U. S. 457</a></p><p> "Procedures Memorandum" on the subject of "Visiting Regulations."  The memorandum begins with a Statement of Policy and Purpose:</p>\n<p>"Although administrative staff reserves the right to allow or disallow visits, it is the policy of the Kentucky State Reformatory to respect the right of inmates to have visits in the spirit of the Court decisions and the Consent Decree, while insuring the safety and security of the institution."</p>\n<p>App. 106.  The memorandum then goes on to state that a visitor may be denied entry if his or her presence would constitute a "clear and probable danger to the safety and security of the institution or would interfere with the orderly operation of the institution."  \xef\xbf\xbd K(1)(a), App. 133.  A nonexhaustive list of nine specific reasons for excluding visitors is set forth. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  The memorandum also states that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="458">Page 490 U. S. 458</a></p><p> decision whether to exclude a visitor rests with the duty officer, who is to be consulted by any staff member who "feels a visitor should not be allowed admittance."  \xef\xbf\xbd K(3), App. 134.</p>\n<p>This particular litigation was prompted in large part by two incidents when applicants were denied the opportunity to visit an inmate at the reformatory.  The mother of one inmate was denied visitation for six months because she brought to the reformatory a person who had been barred for smuggling contraband.  Another inmate\'s mother and woman friend were denied visitation for a limited time when the inmate was found with contraband after a visit by the two women.  In both instances, the visitation privileges were suspended without a hearing.  The inmates were not prevented from receiving other visitors.</p>\n<p>The representatives of the Kendrick inmate class filed a motion with the United States District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (the court which had issued the consent decree), claiming that the suspension of visitation privileges without a hearing in these two instances violated the decree and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="459">Page 490 U. S. 459</a></p><p> By a memorandum dated June 26, 1986, the District Court found that the prison policies did not violate the decree, App. 147, but concluded that the language of the decree was "mandatory in character," <em>id.</em> at 148, and that, under the standards articulated by this Court in <em>Hewitt v. Helms,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html">459 U. S. 460</a></span> (1983), respondents "possess a liberty interest in open visitation."  The District Court directed petitioners to develop "minimal due process procedures," including "an informal, nonadversary review in which a prisoner receives notice of and reasons for" any decision to exclude a visitor, as well as an opportunity to respond.  App. 148.  A formal order was issued accordingly.  <em>Id.</em> at 149.</p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed and remanded the case.  833 F.2d 614 (1987).  Relying not only on the consent decree but also on the regulations and stated policies, the court held that the relevant language was sufficiently mandatory to create a liberty interest.  The Court of Appeals found that the relevant prison policies "placed <em>substantive limitations on official discretion.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at 618-619, quoting <em>Olim v. Wakinekona,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html">461 U. S. 238</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#249">461 U. S. 249</a></span> (1983).  The court also found that the language of the consent decree, that "[d]efendants <em>shall</em> continue their open visiting policy" (emphasis supplied by Court of Appeals), <em>see Kendrick v. Bland,</em> 541 F.Supp. at 37, coupled with a provision from the policy statement that "[a]n inmate <em>is</em> allowed three (3) separate visits . . . per week" (emphasis added by Court of Appeals), Reformatory Procedures \xef\xbf\xbd B(3), App. 108, satisfied the requirement of "mandatory language" articulated by our prior cases.  <em>See</em> 833 F.2d at 618.\n</em></p>\n<p>Because this case appeared to raise important issues relevant to general prison administration, we granted certiorari.  487 U.S. 1217 (1988).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Fourteenth Amendment reads in part:  "nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without </p><p><a class="page-number" name="460">Page 490 U. S. 460</a></p><p> due process of law," and protects "the individual against arbitrary action of government," <em>Wolff v. McDonnell,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html">418 U. S. 539</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html#558">418 U. S. 558</a></span> (1974).  We examine procedural due process questions in two steps:  the first asks whether there exists a liberty or property interest which has been interfered with by the State, <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html">408 U. S. 564</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html#571">408 U. S. 571</a></span> (1972); the second examines whether the procedures attendant upon that deprivation were constitutionally sufficient, <em>Hewitt v. Helms,</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#472">459 U. S. 472</a></span>.  The types of interests that constitute "liberty" and "property" for Fourteenth Amendment purposes are not unlimited; the interest must rise to more than "an abstract need or desire," <em>Board of Regents of State Colleges v. Roth,</em> 408 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/408/564/case.html#577">408 U. S. 577</a></span>, and must be based on more than "a unilateral hope," <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html">452 U. S. 458</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html#465">452 U. S. 465</a></span> (1981).  Rather, an individual claiming a protected interest must have a legitimate claim of entitlement to it.  Protected liberty interests "may arise from two sources -- the Due Process Clause itself and the laws of the States."  <em>Hewitt v. Helms,</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#466">459 U. S. 466</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Respondents do not argue -- nor can it seriously be contended, in light of our prior cases -- that an inmate\'s interest in unfettered visitation is guaranteed directly by the Due Process Clause.  We have rejected the notion that</p>\n<p>"<em>any</em> change in the conditions of confinement having a substantial adverse impact on the prisoner involved is sufficient to invoke the protections of the Due Process Clause."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis in original.)  <em>Meachum v. Fano,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html">427 U. S. 215</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#224">427 U. S. 224</a></span> (1976). This is not to say that a valid conviction extinguishes every direct due process protection;</p>\n<p>"consequences visited on the prisoner that are qualitatively different from the punishment characteristically suffered by a person convicted of crime"</p>\n<p>may invoke the protections of the Due Process Clause even in the absence of a state-created right.  <em>Vitek v. Jones,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html">445 U. S. 480</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#493">445 U. S. 493</a></span> (1980) (transfer to mental hospital).  However,</p>\n<p>"[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement </p><p><a class="page-number" name="461">Page 490 U. S. 461</a></p><p> to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself subject an inmate\'s treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight."</p>\n<p><em>Montanye v. Haymes,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html">427 U. S. 236</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/236/case.html#242">427 U. S. 242</a></span> (1976).  The denial of prison access to a particular visitor "is well within the terms of confinement ordinarily contemplated by a prison sentence," <em>Hewitt v. Helms,</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#468">459 U. S. 468</a></span>, and therefore is not independently protected by the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p>We have held, however, that state law may create enforceable liberty interests in the prison setting.  We have found, for example, that certain regulations granted inmates a protected interest in parole, <em>Board of Pardons v. Allen, <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/482/369/case.html">482 U. S. 369</a></span> (1987); Greenholtz v. Nebraska Penal Inmates,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/442/1/case.html">442 U. S. 1</a></span> (1979), in good-time credits, <em>Wolff v. McDonnell,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html#556">418 U. S. 556</a></span>-572, in freedom from involuntary transfer to a mental hospital, <em>Vitek v. Jones,</em> 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#487">445 U. S. 487</a></span>-494, and in freedom from more restrictive forms of confinement within the prison, <em>Hewitt v. Helms, supra.</em>  In contrast, we have found that certain state statutes and regulations did not create a protected liberty interest in transfer to another prison.  <em>Meachum v. Fano,</em> 427 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/427/215/case.html#225">427 U. S. 225</a></span> (intrastate transfer); <em>Olim v. Wakinekona, supra,</em> (interstate transfer).  The fact that certain state-created liberty interests have been found to be entitled to due process protection, while others have not, is not the result of this Court\'s judgment as to what interests are more significant than others; rather, our method of inquiry in these cases always has been to examine closely the language of the relevant statutes and regulations. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="462">Page 490 U. S. 462</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Stated simply, "a State creates a protected liberty interest by placing substantive limitations on official discretion."  <em>Olim v. Wakinekona,</em> 461 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#249">461 U. S. 249</a></span>.  A State may do this in a number of ways.  Neither the drafting of regulations nor their interpretation can be reduced to an exact science.  Our past decisions suggest, however, that the most common manner in which a State creates a liberty interest is by establishing "substantive predicates" to govern official decisionmaking, <em>Hewitt v. Helms,</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#472">459 U. S. 472</a></span>, and, further, by mandating the outcome to be reached upon a finding that the relevant criteria have been met.</p>\n<p>Most of our procedural due process cases in the prison context have turned on the presence or absence of language creating "substantive predicates" to guide discretion.  For example, the failure of a Connecticut statute governing commutation of sentences to provide "particularized standards or criteria [to] guide the State\'s decisionmakers," <em>Connecticut Board of Pardons v. Dumschat,</em> 452 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html#467">452 U. S. 467</a></span> (BRENNAN, J., concurring), defeated an inmate\'s claim that the State had created a liberty interest.  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/452/458/case.html#465">452 U. S. 465</a></span> (majority opinion).  <em>See also Olim v. Wakinekona,</em> 461 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#249">461 U.

In other instances, we have found that prison regulations or statutes do provide decisionmaking criteria which serve to limit discretion.  <em>See, e.g., Hewitt v.

They argue that this bright line would allow prison officials to issue guidelines to prison staff to govern minor decisions without thereby transforming the details of prison life into "liberty interests" with accompanying procedural rights.

We express no view on the proposal, and leave its resolution for another day.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>It should be obvious that the mandatory language requirement is not an invitation to courts to search regulations for any imperative that might be found. The search is for relevant mandatory language that expressly requires the decisionmaker to apply certain substantive predicates in determining whether an inmate may be deprived of the particular interest in question. Thus, one of the examples of mandatory language relied upon by the Court of Appeals is unavailing, that is, the statement that an inmate "is allowed three (3) separate visits in the Visiting Building per week."App. 108. This directive says nothing about whether any particular visitor must be admitted, and thus has no direct relevance to the decision whether to exclude a particular visitor, which is what is at issue here. Another example of irrelevant mandatory language is the following: "A visitor who is denied a visit will not be allowed to visit an inmate for up to six (6) months following the incident." (Emphasis added.) See  <a href="#F2" name="T2">n</a> 2, <em>supra.</em> This language refers only to the penalty to be imposed once an individual is found to be unfit to visit, and has no role to play in guiding prison officials\' discretion in deciding whether to exclude a visitor in the first instance.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>The language of the consent decree, that "[d]efendants shall continue their open visiting policy," is mandatory only to the extent that it prevents the State from making its regulations more restrictive than they were at the time the decree was entered.  Obviously, the promise to leave unchanged a discretionary policy does not transform that policy into a mandatory one.  The District Court found that the regulations enacted after the decree was signed were no more restrictive than those already in place.  App. 147.  For this reason, we need make no judgment as to whether a consent decree can create a liberty interest protected by the Fourteenth Amendment.  The issue was not briefed or argued by the parties or discussed below, and is not necessary to our decision.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE KENNEDY, concurring.</p>\n<p>I concur fully in the opinion and judgment of the Court.  I write separately to note that this case involves a denial of prison access to particular visitors, not a general ban on all prison visitation.  Nothing in the Court\'s opinion forecloses the claim that a prison regulation permanently forbidding all visits to some or all prisoners implicates the protections of the Due Process Clause in a way that the precise and individualized restrictions at issue here do not.</p>\n<p>JUSTICE MARSHALL, with whom JUSTICE BRENNAN and JUSTICE STEVENS join, dissenting.</p>\n<p>As a result of today\'s decision, correctional authorities at the Kentucky State Reformatory are free to deny prisoners visits from parents, spouses, children, clergy members, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="466">Page 490 U. S. 466</a></p><p> close friends for any reason whatsoever, or for no reason at all.  Prisoners will not even be entitled to learn the reason, if any, why a visitor has been turned away.  In my view, the exercise of such unbridled governmental power over the basic human need to see family members and friends strikes at the heart of the liberty protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.  Recognizing a liberty interest in this case would not create a right to "unfettered visitation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#460">490 U.

Because the majority refuses to take this small step, I dissent.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>The majority begins its analysis by conceding, as it must under our precedents, that prisoners do not shed their constitutional rights at the prison gate, but instead retain a residuum of constitutionally protected liberty independent of any state laws or regulations.  <em>See ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#459">490 U. S. 459</a></span>-461. [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]  In the balance of its opinion, however, the majority proceeds to prove the emptiness of this initial gesture.  In concluding that prison visits implicate no retained liberty interest, the majority applies the following oft-cited test:</p>\n<p>"\'[a]s long as the conditions or degree of confinement to which the prisoner is subjected is within the sentence imposed upon him and is not otherwise violative of the Constitution, the Due Process Clause does not in itself subject an inmate\'s treatment by prison authorities to judicial oversight.\'"</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#460">490 U.

As applied, this test offers prisoners scant more protection, for the Justices employing it have rarely scrutinized the actual conditions of confinement faced by the prisoners in the correctional institutions at issue.

[<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  Although the details vary, the standards uniformly provide that visitors should not be barred except for good cause shown.  Kentucky itself, in its statewide Corrections Policies and Procedures (Commonwealth Procedures), recognizes that visits permit reformatory inmates such as Kenneth Bobbitt and Kevin Black "to maintain morale and contact with the community," and thus "are important to the inmate and his success within the community upon release."

Under the majority\'s disposition, neither prisoner will ever have a right to contest the prison authorities\' account.

Once it is clear that a State has imposed substantive criteria in statutes or regulations to guide or limit official discretion, there is no reason to assume -- as the majority does -- that officials applying the statutes or regulations are likely to ignore the criteria if there is not some undefined quantity of the words "shall" or "must."  Drafters of statutes or regulations do not ordinarily view the criteria they establish as mere surplusage.  Absent concrete evidence that state officials routinely ignore substantive criteria set forth in statutes or regulations (and there is no such evidence here), it is only proper to assume that the criteria are regularly employed in practice, thereby creating legitimate expectations worthy of protection by the Due Process Clause.

The Reformatory Memorandum also expressly references the American Correctional Association\'s visitation standards, which provide that</p>\n<p>"visits may be limited <em>only</em> by the institution\'s schedule, space, and personnel constraints, or when there are substantial reasons to justify such limitations."</p>\n<p>American Correctional Association, Standards for Adult Correctional Institutions, Standard 2-4381 (2d ed.1981) (emphasis added), cited at App. 106.  Nothing in these standards even remotely contemplates the arbitrary exclusion of visitors.</p>\n<p>When these mandatory commands are read in conjunction with the detailed rules set forth in the Commonwealth Procedures, [<a href="#F2/10" name="T2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>] it is inconceivable that prisoners in the reformatory </p><p><a class="page-number" name="474">Page 490 U. S. 474</a></p><p> would not</p>\n<p>"reasonably form an objective expectation that a visit would necessarily be allowed absent the occurrence of one of the listed conditions."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#465">490 U. S. 465</a></span>.  The majority inexplicably ignores nearly all of these commands, despite claiming to have considered the "overall effect of the regulations," <em>ibid.,</em> and despite the Commonwealth\'s striking concession that the regulations "repeatedly use <em>will\', `shall\', and similar directive or mandatory language" in an effort "to advise inmates and potential visitors what is <em>expected.</em>"  Brief for Petitioners 13, 30 (emphasis added); <em>see also</em> Tr. of Oral Arg. 5-6 ("[O]ur procedures are very limiting in the discretion of the officials"). [<a href="#F2/11" name="T2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]  In light of these mandatory commands, the caveat, as well as any other language that could be taken to suggest that visitors need not "fall within one of the described categories in order to be excluded," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#464">490 U. S. 464</a></span>, amount to nothing more than mere boilerplate.  The Court should reject the view that\n</em></p>\n<p>"state laws which impose substantive limitations and elaborate procedural requirements on official conduct create no liberty interest solely because there remains the possibility that an official will act in an arbitrary manner at the end of the process."</p>\n<p><em>Olim,</em> 461 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/461/238/case.html#258">461 U.

Cunningham,</em> 813 F.2d 1, 8 (CA1 1987).</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority\'s reliance on the fact that both the Commonwealth Procedures and the Reformatory Memorandum provide that a visitor "may" be excluded if he falls within one of the enumerated categories, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#464">490 U. S. 464</a></span>, is misplaced.  The word "may" in this context simply means that prison authorities possess the discretion to allow visits from persons who fall within one of the enumerated categories.  Surely this possibility cannot defeat a prisoner\'s legitimate expectation that visitors will be denied <em>only</em> when they fall within one of those categories.  In <em>Hewitt,</em> regulations regarding administrative segregation were deemed to have created a liberty interest even though they stated that a prisoner "may" be placed in segregation on the occurrence of specified substantive predicates.  <em>See</em> 459 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/459/460/case.html#470">459 U. S. 470</a></span>, n. 6.  Likewise, in <em>Vitek,</em> a prisoner had a state-created liberty interest in not being transferred to a mental hospital even though the applicable state statute provided that the director of correctional services "may" transfer a prisoner to such a hospital after certain medical findings are made.  <em>See</em> 445 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/445/480/case.html#483">445 U. S. 483</a></span>, n. 1.  If the use of the word "may" could not defeat a liberty interest in <em>Hewitt</em> or <em>Vitek,</em> I fail to see how it could do so here.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>The prisoners in this case do not seek a right to unfettered visitation.  All they ask is that the Court recognize that visitation is sufficiently important to warrant procedural protections to ensure that visitors are not arbitrarily denied.  The protections need not be extensive, but simply commensurate with the special "needs and exigencies of the institutional environment."  <em>Wolff,</em> 418 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/539/case.html#565">418 U. S. 565</a></span>.  In making the threshold determination that the denial of visits can never implicate a prisoner\'s liberty interest, the majority thus establishes that, when visitors are turned away, <em>no</em> process, not </p><p><a class="page-number" name="476">Page 490 U.

I read the majority opinion as limited to prisoners in the reformatory for several reasons.  First, although the majority points to language both in the statewide Commonwealth Procedures and the institution-specific Reformatory Memorandum in first determining that there are sufficient substantive predicates cabining official discretion, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#463">490 U. S. 463</a></span>-464, the majority relies exclusively on statements in the Reformatory Memorandum in finding insufficient mandatory language to create a liberty interest.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#464">490 U. S. 464</a></span>-465.  Second, Bobbitt and Black -- the only prisoners subject to visitation denials in this case -- were both incarcerated in the reformatory at the time of the incidents giving rise to this litigation.  Third, the Reformatory Memorandum is the only institution-specific set of rules before the Court.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 28.  It is quite possible that other correctional facilities in the Commonwealth have promulgated rules which create a liberty interest even under the majority\'s linguistic approach.  As the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit noted below, "it is unclear from the record what set of regulations governs visits in other parts of the Kentucky System."  833 F.2d 614, 619 (1987).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/9" name="F2/9">Footnote 2/9</a>]</p>\n<p>These procedures pertain to such matters as the days, lengths, times, and places for visits; the dress code for prisoners and visitors; the scope of permissible searches of prisoners and visitors; the type of contact permitted between prisoners and visitors; and the special rules for night visits and outdoor visits, as well as for legal, clergy, and hospital visits.  App. 106-132.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/10" name="F2/10">Footnote 2/10</a>]</p>\n<p>Although the Commonwealth Procedures are somewhat less elaborate -- because the individual correctional institutions are charged with supplementing these statewide rules with ones designed to fit their own institutions -- there is no shortage of mandatory language.  Visits "<em>are</em> to be promoted and facilitated by each institution," <em>id.</em> at 98 (emphasis added); "[a]t a minimum," weekend and holiday visiting "<em>shall</em> [be] permi[tted]," <em>id.</em> at 99 (emphasis added); the individual institutions "<em>must</em> allow each inmate the opportunity to visit a minimum of eight hours per month," <em>ibid.</em> (emphasis added); and "[u]nder normal conditions, any [regular visitor] <em>can</em> visit <em>unless</em> visits could reasonably create a threat to the security and order of the institution," <em>id.</em> at 100 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/11" name="F2/11">Footnote 2/11</a>]</p>\n<p>It is no answer to say that most of the mandatory commands are irrelevant because the decision "to exclude a particular visitor" is the only issue in this case.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/490/454/case.html#464">490 U.
