GILLESPIE COUNTY<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">ROTHGERY <em>v</em>. GILLESPIE COUNTY, TEXAS</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 07\xe2\x80\x93440.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 17, 2008\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 23, 2008</p>\n<p align="left">Texas police relied on erroneous information that petitioner Rothgery had a previous felony conviction to arrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm.  The officers brought Rothgery before a magistrate judge, as required by state law, for a so-called \xe2\x80\x9carticle 15.17 hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d at which the Fourth Amendment probable-cause determination was made, bail was set, and Rothgery was formally apprised of the accusation against him.  After the hearing, the magistrate judge committed Rothgery to jail, and he was released after posting a surety bond.  Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several unheeded oral and written requests for appointed counsel.  He was subsequently indicted and rearrested, his bail was increased, and he was jailed when he could not post the bail.  Subsequently, Rothgery was assigned a lawyer, who assembled the paperwork that prompted the indictment\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rothgery then brought this 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 action against respondent County, claiming that if it had provided him a lawyer within a reasonable time after the article 15.17 hearing, he would not have been indicted, rearrested, or jailed.  He asserts that the County\xe2\x80\x99s unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out on bond until an indictment is entered violates his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  The District Court granted the County summary judgment, and the Fifth Circuit affirmed, considering itself bound by Circuit precedent to the effect that the right to counsel did not attach at the article 15.17 hearing because the relevant prosecutors were not aware of, or involved in, Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or appearance at the hearing, and there was no indication that the officer at Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s appearance had any power to commit the State to prosecute without a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge or involvement.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0A criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance before a magistrate judge, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  Attachment does not also require that a prosecutor (as distinct from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9320.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Texas\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing marks the point of attachment, with the consequent state obligation to appoint counsel within a reasonable time once a request for assistance is made.  This Court has twice held that the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance before a judicial officer at which a defendant is told of the formal accusation against him and restrictions are imposed on his liberty.  See <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/index.html">475 U. S. 625</a>, 629, n. 3; <em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/index.html">430 U. S. 387</a>, 398\xe2\x80\x93399.  Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s hearing was an initial appearance:\xc2\xa0he was taken before a magistrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail.  Thus, <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> control.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9310. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0In <em>McNeil</em> v. <em>Wisconsin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/171/index.html">501 U. S. 171</a>, 180\xe2\x80\x93181, the Court reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the first formal proceeding against an accused,\xe2\x80\x9d and observed that \xe2\x80\x9cin most States \xe2\x80\xa6 free counsel is made available at that time.\xe2\x80\x9d  That observation remains true today.  The overwhelming consensus practice conforms to the rule that the first formal proceeding is the point of attachment.  The Court is advised without contradiction that not only the Federal Government, including the District of Columbia, but 43 States take the first step toward appointing counsel before, at, or just after initial appearance.  To the extent the remaining 7 States have been denying appointed counsel at that time, they are a distinct minority.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9312. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Neither the Fifth Circuit nor the County offers an acceptable justification for the minority practice.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9319. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit found the determining factor to be that no prosecutor was aware of Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing or involved in it.  This prosecutorial awareness standard is wrong.  Neither <em>Brewer</em> nor <em>Jackson</em> said a word about the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s involvement as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one.  Those cases left no room for the factual enquiry the Circuit would require, and with good reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s first involvement would be \xe2\x80\x9cwholly unworkable and impossible to administer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U. S. 478</a>, 496.  The Fifth Circuit derived its rule from the statement, in <em>Kirby</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/index.html">406 U. S. 682</a>, 689, that the right to counsel attaches when the government has \xe2\x80\x9ccommitted itself to prosecute.\xe2\x80\x9d  But what counts as such a commitment is an issue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power among state officials under state law, cf. <em>Moran</em> v. <em>Burbine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/412/index.html">475 U. S. 412</a>, 429, n.\xc2\xa03, and under the federal standard, an accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accused\xe2\x80\x99s liberty, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kirby, supra, </em>at 689.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9315. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0The County relies on <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gouveia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/index.html">467 U. S. 180</a>, in arguing that in considering the initial appearance\xe2\x80\x99s significance, this Court must ignore prejudice to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial liberty, it being the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment.  But the County\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion that Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance was refuted by <em>Jackson</em>, 475 U. S., at 629, n.\xc2\xa03.  And since the Court is not asked to extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in <em>Gouveia</em>), but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prosecutor is involved, <em>Gouveia</em> does not speak to the question at issue.  Pp.\xc2\xa015\xe2\x80\x9317. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(3)\xc2\xa0The County\xe2\x80\x99s third tack gets it no further.  Stipulating that the properly formulated test is whether the State has objectively committed itself to prosecute, the County says that prosecutorial involvement is but one form of evidence of such commitment and that others include (1) the filing of formal charges or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file such charges, and (2) a court appearance following arrest on an indictment.  Either version runs up against <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson:\xc2\xa0</em>an initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s participation, indictment, information, or what the County calls a \xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d complaint.  The County\xe2\x80\x99s assertions that <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> are \xe2\x80\x9cvague\xe2\x80\x9d and thus of limited, if any, precedential value are wrong.  Although the Court in those cases saw no need for lengthy<font b="1"> disquisitions on the initial appearance\xe2\x80\x99s significance, that was because it found the attachment issue an easy one.

See <em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/index.html">430 U. S. 387</a>, 398\xe2\x80\x93399 (1977); <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/index.html">475 U. S. 625</a>, 629, n. 3 (1986).  The question here is whether attachment of the right also requires that a public prosecutor (as distinct from a police officer) be aware of that initial proceeding or involved in its conduct.  We hold that it does not.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although petitioner Walter Rothgery has never been convicted of a felony,[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] a criminal background check disclosed an erroneous record that he had been, and on July 15, 2002, Texas police officers relied on this record to arrest him as a felon in possession of a firearm.  The officers lacked a warrant, and so promptly brought Rothgery before a magistrate judge, as required by Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 14.06(a) (West Supp. 2007).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Texas law has no formal label for this initial appearance before a magistrate, see 41 G. Dix &amp; R. Dawson, Texas Practice Series: Criminal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa715.01 (2d ed. 2001), which is sometimes called the \xe2\x80\x9carticle 15.17 hearing,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Kirk</em> v. <em>State</em>, 199 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 467, 476\xe2\x80\x93477 (Tex. App. 2006); it combines the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s required probable-cause determination[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] with the setting of bail, and is the point at which the arrestee is formally apprised of the accusation against him, see Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 15.17(a).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing followed routine.  The arresting officer submitted a sworn \xe2\x80\x9cAffidavit Of Probable Cause\xe2\x80\x9d that described the facts supporting the arrest and \xe2\x80\x9ccharge[d] that \xe2\x80\xa6 Rothgery \xe2\x80\xa6 commit[ted] the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon\xe2\x80\x943rd degree felony [Tex. Penal Code Ann. \xc2\xa746.04],\xe2\x80\x9d App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a.  After reviewing the affidavit, the magistrate judge \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that probable cause existed for the arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 34a.  The magistrate judge informed Rothgery of the accusation, set his bail at $5,000, and committed him to jail, from which he was released after posting a surety bond.  The bond, which the Gillespie County deputy sheriff signed, stated that \xe2\x80\x9cRothgery stands charged by complaint duly filed \xe2\x80\xa6 with the offense of a \xe2\x80\xa6 felony, to wit: Unlawful Possession of a Firearm by a Felon.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 39a.  The release was conditioned on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s personal appearance in trial court \xe2\x80\x9cfor any and all subsequent proceedings that may be had relative to the said charge in the course of the criminal action based on said charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rothgery had no money for a lawyer and made several oral and written requests for appointed counsel,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] which went unheeded.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  The following January, he was indicted by<font b="1"> a Texas grand jury for unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon, resulting in rearrest the next day, and an order increasing bail to $15,000.

Counsel relayed this information to the district attorney, who in turn filed a motion to dismiss the indictment, which was granted.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rothgery then brought this 42 U.

The County\xe2\x80\x99s failure is said to be owing to its unwritten policy of denying appointed counsel to indigent defendants out on bond until at least the entry of an information or indictment.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Rothgery sees this policy as violating his Sixth Amendment right to counsel.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment to the County, see 413 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 806, 807 (WD Tex. 2006), and the Court of Appeals affirmed, see 491 F.\xc2\xa03d 293, 294 (CA5 2007).

This first time before a court, also known as the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98preliminary arraignment\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arraignment on the complaint,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d see 1 W.

Texas\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing is an initial appearance: Rothgery was taken before a magistrate judge, informed of the formal accusation against him, and sent to jail until he posted bail.  See <em>supra</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> control.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The <em>Brewer</em> defendant surrendered to the police after a warrant was out for his arrest on a charge of abduction.  He was then \xe2\x80\x9carraigned before a judge \xe2\x80\xa6 on the outstanding arrest warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d and at the arraignment, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he judge advised him of his <em>Miranda </em>[v. <em>Arizona, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U.

After this preliminary arraignment, and before an indictment on the abduction charge had been handed up, police elicited incriminating admissions that ultimately led to an indictment for first-degree murder.  Because neither of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers had been present when the statements were obtained, the Court found it \xe2\x80\x9cclear\xe2\x80\x9d that the defendant \xe2\x80\x9cwas deprived of \xe2\x80\xa6 the right to the assistance of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 397\xe2\x80\x93398.

Although it noted that the State had conceded the issue, the Court nevertheless held that the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right had clearly attached for the reason that \xe2\x80\x9c[a] warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a \xe2\x80\xa6 courtroom, and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Jackson</em>, the Court was asked to revisit the question whether the right to counsel attaches at the initial appearance, and we had no more trouble answering it the second time around.  <em>Jackson</em> was actually two consolidated cases, and although the State conceded that respondent Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s arraignment \xe2\x80\x9crepresented the initiation of formal legal proceedings,\xe2\x80\x9d 475 U.

The State noted that \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hile [Bladel] had been arraigned \xe2\x80\xa6 , there is also a second arraignment in Michigan procedure \xe2\x80\xa6 , at which time defendant has his first opportunity to enter a plea in a court with jurisdiction to render a final decision in a felony case.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 25.

The conclusion was driven by the same considerations the Court had endorsed in <em>Brewer</em>: by the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the prosecution, the State\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the defendant has become solidly adversarial.

Neither the Court of Appeals in its opinion, nor the County in its briefing to us, has offered an acceptable one.</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals thought <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> could be distinguished on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cneither case addressed the issue of prosecutorial involvement,\xe2\x80\x9d and the cases were thus \xe2\x80\x9cneutral on the point,\xe2\x80\x9d 491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 298.  With <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> distinguished, the court then found itself bound by Circuit precedent that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98an adversary criminal proceeding has not begun in a case where the prosecution officers are unaware of either the charges or the arrest.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See 491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 297 (quoting <em>McGee</em> v. <em>Estelle</em>, 625 F.\xc2\xa03d 1206, 1208 (CA5 1980)).  Under this standard of prosecutorial awareness, attachment depends not on whether a first appearance has begun adversary judicial proceedings, but on whether the prosecutor had a hand in starting it.  That standard is wrong.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither <em>Brewer</em> nor <em>Jackson</em> said a word about the prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s involvement as a relevant fact, much less a controlling one.  Those cases left no room for the factual enquiry the Court of Appeals would require, and with good reason: an attachment rule that turned on determining the moment of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s first involvement would be \xe2\x80\x9cwholly unworkable and impossible to administer,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U.

And it would have the practical effect of resting attachment on such absurd distinctions as the day of the month an arrest is made, see Brief for Brennan Center of Justice et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 10 (explaining that \xe2\x80\x9cjails may be required to report their arrestees to county prosecutor offices on particular days\xe2\x80\x9d (citing Tex.

S., at 689.  The Court of Appeals reasoned that because \xe2\x80\x9cthe decision not to prosecute is the quintessential function of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x9d under Texas law, 491 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 297 (internal quotation marks omitted), the State could not commit itself to prosecution until the prosecutor signaled that it had.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But what counts as a commitment to prosecute is an issue of federal law unaffected by allocations of power among state officials under a State\xe2\x80\x99s law, cf. <em>Moran,</em> 475 U. S., at 429, n. 3 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he type of circumstances that would give rise to the right would certainly have a federal definition\xe2\x80\x9d), and under the federal standard, an accusation filed with a judicial officer is sufficiently formal, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s commitment to prosecute it sufficiently concrete, when the accusation prompts arraignment and restrictions on the accused\xe2\x80\x99s liberty to facilitate the prosecution, see <em>Jackson</em>, 475 U. S., at 629, n. 3; <em>Brewer</em>, 430 U. S., at 399; <em>Kirby, supra</em>, at 689; see also n.\xc2\xa09, <em>supra</em>.  From that point on, the defendant is \xe2\x80\x9cfaced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law\xe2\x80\x9d that define his capacity and control his actual ability to defend himself against a formal accusation that he is a criminal.  <em>Kirby, supra,</em> at 689.  By that point, it is too late to wonder whether he is \xe2\x80\x9caccused\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment, and it makes no practical sense to deny it.  See Grano, <em>Rhode Island</em> v. <em>Innis</em>: A Need to Reconsider the Constitutional Premises Underlying the Law of Confessions, 17 Am. Crim. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1, 31 (1979) (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t would defy common sense to say that a criminal prosecution has not commenced against a defendant who, perhaps incarcerated and unable to afford judicially imposed bail, awaits preliminary examination on the authority of a charging document filed by the prosecutor, less typically by the police, and approved by a court of law\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  All of this is equally true whether the machinery of prosecution was turned on by the local police or the state attorney general.  In this case, for example, Rothgery alleges that after the initial appearance, he was \xe2\x80\x9cunable to find any employment for wages\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9call of the potential employers he contacted knew or learned of the criminal charge pending against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  Original Complaint in No. 1:04\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x9300456\xe2\x80\x93LY (WD Tex., July 15, 2004), p.\xc2\xa05.  One may assume that those potential employers would still have declined to make job offers if advised that the county prosecutor had not filed the complaint.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n<font b="1">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The County resists this logic with the argument that in considering the significance of the initial appearance, we must ignore prejudice to a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s pretrial liberty, reasoning that it is the concern, not of the right to counsel, but of the speedy-trial right and the Fourth Amendment.  See Brief for Respondent 47\xe2\x80\x9351.  And it cites <em>Gouveia</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/180/index.html"></a><a href="/us/467/180/index.html">467 U. S. 180</a>, in support of its contention.  See Brief for Respondent 49; see also Brief for Texas et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x939.  We think the County\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on <em>Gouveia</em> is misplaced, and its argument mistaken.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The defendants in <em>Gouveia</em> were prison inmates, suspected of murder, who had been placed in an administrative detention unit and denied counsel up until an indictment was filed.  Although no formal judicial proceedings had taken place prior to the indictment, see 467 U. S., at 185, the defendants argued that their administrative detention should be treated as an accusation for purposes of the right to counsel because the government was actively investigating the crimes.  We recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cbecause an inmate suspected of a crime is already in prison, the prosecution may have little incentive promptly to bring formal charges against him, and that the resulting preindictment delay may be particularly prejudicial to the inmate,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.,</em> at 192, but we noted that statutes of limitation and protections of the Fifth Amendment guarded against delay, and that there was no basis for \xe2\x80\x9cdepart[ing] from our traditional interpretation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel in order to provide additional protections for [the inmates],\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Gouveia</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel had not attached has no application here.  For one thing, <em>Gouveia</em> does not affect the conclusion we reaffirmed two years later in <em>Jackson</em>, that bringing a defendant before a court for initial appearance signals a sufficient commitment to prosecute and marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings.  (Indeed, <em>Jackson</em> refutes the County\xe2\x80\x99s argument that Fifth Amendment protections at the early stage obviate attachment of the Sixth Amendment right at initial appearance.  See <em>supra</em>, at 8\xe2\x80\x939.)  And since we are not asked to extend the right to counsel to a point earlier than formal judicial proceedings (as in <em>Gouveia</em>), but to defer it to those proceedings in which a prosecutor is involved, <em>Gouveia</em> does not speak to the question before us.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The County also tries to downplay the significance of the initial appearance by saying that an attachment rule unqualified by prosecutorial involvement would lead to the conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cthat the State has statutorily committed to prosecute <em>every</em> suspect arrested by the police,\xe2\x80\x9d given that \xe2\x80\x9cstate law requires [an article 15.17 hearing] for every arrestee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 24 (emphasis in original).  The answer, though, is that the State has done just that, subject to the option to change its official mind later.  The State may rethink its commitment at any point: it may choose not to seek indictment in a felony case, say, or the prosecutor may enter <em>nolle prosequi</em> after the case gets to the jury room.  But without a change of position, a defendant subject to accusation after initial appearance is headed for trial and needs to get a lawyer working, whether to attempt to avoid that trial or to be ready with a defense when the trial date arrives.</p>\n<p align="left">3</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A third tack on the County\xe2\x80\x99s part, slightly different from the one taken by the Fifth Circuit, gets it no further.  The County stipulates that \xe2\x80\x9cthe properly formulated test is not \xe2\x80\xa6 merely whether prosecutors have had any involvement in the case whatsoever, but instead whether the State has objectively committed itself to prosecute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 31.  It then informs us that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]rosecutorial involvement is merely one form of evidence of such commitment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  Other sufficient evidentiary indications are variously described: first (expansively) as \xe2\x80\x9cthe filing of formal charges \xe2\x80\xa6 by information, indictment or formal complaint, or the holding of an adversarial preliminary hearing to determine probable cause to file such charges,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em> (citing <em>Kirby</em>, 406 U. S., at 689); then (restrictively) as a court appearance following \xe2\x80\x9carrest \xe2\x80\xa6 on an indictment or information,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 32.  Either version, in any event, runs up against <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em>: an initial appearance following a charge signifies a sufficient commitment to prosecute regardless of a prosecutor\xe2\x80\x99s participation, indictment, information, or what the County calls a \xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d complaint.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0So the County is reduced to taking aim at those cases.  <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em>, we are told, are \xe2\x80\x9cvague\xe2\x80\x9d and thus of \xe2\x80\x9climited, if any, precedential value.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 33, 35; see also <em>id.</em>, at 32, n.\xc2\xa013 (asserting that <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> \xe2\x80\x9cneither provide nor apply an analytical framework for determining attachment\xe2\x80\x9d).  And, according to the County, our cases (<em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> aside) actually establish a \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral rule that the right to counsel attaches at the point that [what the County calls] formal charges are filed,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Respondent 19, with exceptions allowed only in the case of \xe2\x80\x9ca very limited set of specific preindictment situations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 23.  The County suggests that the latter category should be limited to those appearances at which the aid of counsel is urgent and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the dangers to the accused of proceeding without counsel\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d are great.  <em>Id.</em>, at 28 (quoting <em>Patterson</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/487/285/index.html">487 U. S. 285</a>, 298 (1988)).  Texas\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing should not count as one of those situations, the County says, because it is not of critical significance, since it \xe2\x80\x9callows no presentation of witness testimony and provides no opportunity to expose weaknesses in the government\xe2\x80\x99s evidence, create a basis for later impeachment, or even engage in basic discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 29.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We think the County is wrong both about the clarity of our cases and the substance that we find clear.  Certainly it is true that the Court in <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em> saw no need for lengthy<font b="1"> disquisitions on the significance of the initial appearance, but that was because it found the attachment issue an easy one.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions were not vague; <em>Brewer</em> expressed \xe2\x80\x9cno doubt\xe2\x80\x9d that the right to counsel attached at the initial appearance, 430 U. S., at 399, and <em>Jackson</em> said that the opposite result would be \xe2\x80\x9cuntenable,\xe2\x80\x9d 475 U. S., at 629, n.\xc2\xa03.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, indeed, the County had simply taken the cases at face value, it would have avoided the mistake of merging the attachment question (whether formal judicial proceedings have begun) with the distinct \xe2\x80\x9ccritical stage\xe2\x80\x9d question (whether counsel must be present at a postattachment proceeding unless the right to assistance is validly waived).  Attachment occurs when the government has used the judicial machinery to signal a commitment to prosecute as spelled out in <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson</em>.  Once attachment occurs, the accused at least[<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>] is entitled to the presence of appointed counsel during any \xe2\x80\x9ccritical stage\xe2\x80\x9d of the postattachment proceedings; what makes a stage critical is what shows the need for counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence.[<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  Thus, counsel must be appointed within a reasonable time after attachment to allow for adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The County thus makes an analytical mistake in its assumption that attachment necessarily requires the occurrence or imminence of a critical stage.  See Brief for Respondent 28\xe2\x80\x9330.  On the contrary, it is irrelevant to attachment that the presence of counsel at an article 15.17 hearing, say, may not be critical,<font b="1"> just as it is irrelevant that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s presence may not be critical when a prosecutor walks over to the trial court to file an information.  As we said in <em>Jackson</em>, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he question whether arraignment signals the initiation of adversary judicial proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 is distinct from the question whether the arraignment itself is a critical stage requiring the presence of counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 630, n.\xc2\xa03.  Texas\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing plainly signals attachment, even if it is not itself a critical stage.[<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our holding is narrow.  We do not decide whether the 6-month delay in appointment of counsel resulted in prejudice to Rothgery\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights, and have no occasion to consider what standards should apply in deciding this.  We merely reaffirm what we have held before and what an overwhelming majority of American jurisdictions understand in practice: a criminal defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance before a judicial officer, where he learns the charge against him and his liberty is subject to restriction, marks the start of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger attachment of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.

It is true that <em>Brewer</em> appears to have assumed that attachment of the right with respect to the abduction charge should prompt attachment for the murder charge as well.  But the accuracy of the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion ends there, for nothing in <em>Cobb</em>\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the right is offense specific casts doubt on <em>Brewer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s separate, emphatic holding that the initial appearance marks the point at which the right attaches.  Nor does <em>Cobb</em> reflect, as the dissent suggests, see <em>post</em>, at 14, a more general disapproval of our opinion in <em>Brewer</em>.  While <em>Brewer</em> failed even to acknowledge the issue of offense specificity, it spoke clearly and forcefully about attachment.  <em>Cobb</em> merely declined to follow <em>Brewer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s unmentioned assumption, and thus it lends no support to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s claim that we should ignore what <em>Brewer</em> explicitly said.</p>\n<a href="#T11" name="F11">Footnote 11</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The State continued to press this contention at oral argument.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, O.

In Texas, the defendant is notified of his right to a preliminary hearing, which in Texas is called an \xe2\x80\x9cexamining trial,\xe2\x80\x9d at the article 15.17 hearing.  See Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Art. 15.17(a).  The examining trial in Texas is optional only, and the defendant must affirmatively request it.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 25.</p>\n<a href="#T13" name="F13">Footnote 13</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The County, in its brief to this Court, suggests that although <em>Brewer</em> and <em>Jackson </em>spoke of attachment at the initial appearance, the cases might actually have turned on some unmentioned fact.  As to <em>Brewer</em>, the County speculates that an information might have been filed before the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance.  See Brief for Respondent 34\xe2\x80\x9336.  But as Rothgery points out, the initial appearance in <em>Brewer</em> was made in municipal court, and a felony information could not have been filed there.  See Reply Brief for Petitioner 11.  As to <em>Jackson</em>, the County suggests that the Court might have viewed Michigan\xe2\x80\x99s initial arraignment as a significant proceeding only because the defendant could make a statement at that hearing, and because respondent Bladel did in fact purport to enter a plea of not guilty.  See Brief for Respondent 36\xe2\x80\x9337.  But this attempt to explain <em>Jackson</em> as a narrow holding is impossible to square with <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s sweeping rejection of the State\xe2\x80\x99s claims.  It is further undermined by the fact that the magistrate judge in Bladel\xe2\x80\x99s case, like the one in Texas\xe2\x80\x99s article 15.17 hearing, had no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.

S. 682</a>, 688 (1972), a plurality of the Court explained that \xe2\x80\x9ca person\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right to counsel attaches only at or after the time that adversary judicial proceedings have been initiated against him.\xe2\x80\x9d  A majority of the Court elaborated on that explanation in <em>Moore</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/220/index.html">434 U. S. 220</a> (1977):</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn <em>Kirby</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, the plurality opinion made clear that the right to counsel announced in <em>Wade</em> and <em>Gilbert</em> attaches only to corporeal identifications conducted at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x94whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.  This is so because the initiation of such proceedings marks the commencement of the \xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecutions\xe2\x80\x99 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.  Thus, in <em>Kirby</em> the plurality held that the prosecution\xe2\x80\x99s evidence of a robbery victim\xe2\x80\x99s one-on-one stationhouse identification of an uncounseled suspect shortly after the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s arrest was admissible because adversary judicial criminal proceedings had not yet been initiated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 226\xe2\x80\x93227 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nWhen we wrote in <em>Kirby</em> and <em>Moore</em> that the Sixth Amendment right had \xe2\x80\x9cattached,\xe2\x80\x9d we evidently meant nothing more than that a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d had begun.

As the Court, notes, however, we have previously held that \xe2\x80\x9carraignments\xe2\x80\x9d that were functionally indistinguishable from the Texas magistration marked the point at which the Sixth Amendment right to counsel \xe2\x80\x9cattached.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante,</em> at 6 (discussing <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra</em>, and <em>Brewer</em>, <em>supra</em>).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It does not follow, however, and I do not understand the Court to hold, that the county had an obligation to appoint an attorney to represent petitioner within some specified period after his magistration.  To so hold, the Court would need to do more than conclude that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s criminal prosecution had begun.  It would also need to conclude that the assistance of counsel in the wake of a Texas magistration is part of the substantive guarantee of the Sixth Amendment.  That question lies beyond our reach, petitioner having never sought our review of it.  See Pet. for Cert. i (inviting us to decide whether the Fifth Circuit erred in concluding \xe2\x80\x9cthat adversary judicial proceedings \xe2\x80\xa6 had not commenced, and petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s Sixth Amendment rights had not attached\xe2\x80\x9d).  To recall the framework laid out earlier, we have been asked to address only the <em>when</em> question, not the <em>what</em> question.  Whereas the temporal scope of the right is defined by the words \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n all criminal prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d the right\xe2\x80\x99s substantive guarantee flows from a different textual font: the words \xe2\x80\x9cAssistance of Counsel for his defence.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In interpreting this latter phrase, we have held that \xe2\x80\x9cdefence\xe2\x80\x9d means defense at trial, not defense in relation to other objectives that may be important to the accused.  See <em>Gouveia</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 190 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he right to counsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Ash</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 309 (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he core purpose of the counsel guarantee was to assure \xe2\x80\x98Assistance\xe2\x80\x99 at trial \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d).  We have thus rejected the argument that the Sixth Amendment entitles the criminal defendant to the assistance of appointed counsel at a probable cause hearing.  See <em>Gerstein</em> v. <em>Pugh</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/420/103/index.html">420 U. S. 103</a>, 122\xe2\x80\x93123 (1975) (observing that the Fourth Amendment hearing \xe2\x80\x9cis addressed only to pretrial custody\xe2\x80\x9d and has an insubstantial effect on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s trial rights).  More generally, we have rejected the notion that the right to counsel entitles the defendant to a \xe2\x80\x9cpreindictment private investigator.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gouveia</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 191.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, we have recognized that certain pretrial events may so prejudice the outcome of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution that, as a practical matter, the defendant must be represented at those events in order to enjoy genuinely effective assistance at trial.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Ash</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 309\xe2\x80\x93310; <em>United States</em> v. <em>Wade</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/218/index.html">388 U. S. 218</a>, 226 (1967).  Thus, we have held that an indigent defendant is entitled to the assistance of appointed counsel at a preliminary hearing if \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial prejudice \xe2\x80\xa6 inheres in the \xe2\x80\xa6 confrontation\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccounsel [may] help avoid that prejudice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/399/1/index.html">399 U. S. 1</a>, 9 (1970) (plurality opinion) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>White</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/59/index.html">373 U. S. 59</a>, 60 (1963) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  We have also held that the assistance of counsel is guaranteed at a pretrial lineup, since \xe2\x80\x9cthe confrontation compelled by the State between the accused and the victim or witnesses to a crime to elicit identification evidence is peculiarly riddled with innumerable dangers and variable factors which might seriously, even crucially, derogate from a fair trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wade</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 228.  Other \xe2\x80\x9ccritical stages\xe2\x80\x9d of the prosecution include pretrial interrogation, a pretrial psychiatric exam, and certain kinds of arraignments.  See <em>Harvey</em>, 494 U. S., at 358, n.\xc2\xa04; <em>Estelle</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 470\xe2\x80\x93471; <em>Coleman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Weaving together these strands of authority, I interpret the Sixth Amendment to require the appointment of counsel only after the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution has begun, and then only as necessary to guarantee the defendant effective assistance at trial.  Cf. <em>McNeil</em>, 501 U. S., at 177\xe2\x80\x93178 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe purpose of the Sixth Amendment counsel guarantee\xe2\x80\x94and hence the purpose of invoking it\xe2\x80\x94is to protec[t] the unaided layman at critical confrontations with his expert adversary, the government, <em>after</em> the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified with respect to a particular alleged crime\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis and alteration in original; internal quotation marks omitted)).  It follows that defendants in Texas will not necessarily be entitled to the assistance of counsel within some specified period after their magistrations.  See <em>ante,</em> at 19 (opinion of the Court) (pointing out the \xe2\x80\x9canalytical mistake\xe2\x80\x9d of assuming \xe2\x80\x9cthat attachment necessarily requires the occurrence or imminence of a critical stage\xe2\x80\x9d).  Texas counties need only appoint counsel as far in advance of trial, and as far in advance of any pretrial \xe2\x80\x9ccritical stage,\xe2\x80\x9d as necessary to guarantee effective assistance at trial.  Cf. <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[C]ounsel must be appointed within a reasonable time after attachment <em>to allow for adequate representation at any critical stage before trial, as well as at trial itself</em>\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court expresses no opinion on whether Gillespie County satisfied that obligation in this case.  Petitioner has asked us to decide only the limited question whether his magistration marked the beginning of his \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the Sixth Amendment.  Because I agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s resolution of that limited question, I join its opinion in full.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1962758">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<strong><br/>\nTHOMAS, J., DISSENTING<br/>\nROTHGERY V.

Echoing this refrain, the Court today reiterates that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he Sixth Amendment right of the \xe2\x80\x98accused\xe2\x80\x99 to assistance of counsel in \xe2\x80\x98all criminal prosecutions\xe2\x80\x99 is limited by its terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 5 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Given the Court\xe2\x80\x99s repeated insistence that the right to counsel is textually limited to \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutions,\xe2\x80\x9d one would expect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s jurisprudence in this area to be grounded in an understanding of what those words meant when the Sixth Amendment was adopted.  Inexplicably, however, neither today\xe2\x80\x99s decision nor any of the other numerous decisions in which the Court has construed the right to counsel has attempted to discern the original meaning of \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  I think it appropriate to examine what a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d would have been understood to entail by those who adopted the Sixth Amendment.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no better place to begin than with Blackstone, \xe2\x80\x9cwhose works constituted the preeminent authority on English law for the founding generation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alden</em> v. <em>Maine</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/527/706/index.html">527 U. S. 706</a>, 715 (1999).  Blackstone devoted more than 100 pages of his Commentaries on the Laws of England to a discussion of the \xe2\x80\x9cregular and ordinary method of proceeding in the courts of criminal jurisdiction.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *289 (hereinafter Blackstone).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the outset of his discussion, Blackstone organized the various stages of a criminal proceeding \xe2\x80\x9cunder twelve general heads, following each other in a progressive order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  The first six relate to pretrial events: \xe2\x80\x9c1. Arrest; 2. Commitment and bail; 3. <em>Prosecution;</em> 4. Process; 5. Arraignment, and it\xe2\x80\x99s incidents; 6. Plea, and issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid. </em>(emphasis added).  Thus, the first significant fact is that Blackstone did not describe the entire criminal process as a \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d but rather listed prosecution as the third step in a list of successive stages.  For a more complete understanding of what Blackstone meant by \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution,\xe2\x80\x9d however, we must turn to chapter 23, entitled \xe2\x80\x9cOf the Several Modes of Prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at *301.  There, Blackstone explained that\xe2\x80\x94after arrest and examination by a justice of the peace to determine whether a suspect should be discharged, committed to prison, or admitted to bail, <em>id</em>., at *296\xe2\x80\x94the \xe2\x80\x9cnext step towards the punishment of offenders is their <em>prosecution,</em> <em>or the manner of their formal accusation</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at  *301 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Blackstone thus provides a definition of \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d: the manner of an offender\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cformal accusation.\xe2\x80\x9d  The modifier \xe2\x80\x9cformal\xe2\x80\x9d is significant because it distinguishes \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d from earlier stages of the process involving a different kind of accusation: the allegation of criminal conduct necessary to justify arrest and detention.\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of arrest, commitment, and bail makes clear that a person could not be arrested and detained without a \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9caccusation,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, an allegation, supported by probable cause, that the person had committed a crime.  See <em>id</em>., at *289\xe2\x80\x93*300.  But the accusation justifying arrest and detention was clearly preliminary to the \xe2\x80\x9cformal accusation\xe2\x80\x9d that Blackstone identified with \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>id</em>., at *290, *318.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By \xe2\x80\x9cformal accusation,\xe2\x80\x9d Blackstone meant, in most cases, \xe2\x80\x9cindictment, the most usual and effectual means of prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at *302.  Blackstone defined an \xe2\x80\x9cindictment\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9ca written accusation of one or more persons of a crime or misdemeanor, preferred to, and presented upon oath by, a grand jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>. (emphasis deleted).  If the grand jury was \xe2\x80\x9csatisfied of the truth of the accusation,\xe2\x80\x9d it endorsed the indictment, <em>id</em>., at *305\xe2\x80\x93*306, which was then \xe2\x80\x9cpublicly delivered into court,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at *306, \xe2\x80\x9cafterwards to be tried and determined,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at *303, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore an officer having power to punish the [charged] offence,\xe2\x80\x9d 2 T. Cunningham, A New and Complete Law Dictionary (2d ed. 1771).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to indictment, Blackstone identified two other \xe2\x80\x9cmethods of prosecution at the suit of the king.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Blackstone *312.  The first was presentment, which, like an indictment, was a grand jury\xe2\x80\x99s formal accusation \xe2\x80\x9cof an offence, inquirable in the Court where it [was] presented.\xe2\x80\x9d  5 G. Jacob, The Law-Dictionary<em> </em>278\xe2\x80\x93279 (1811).  The principal difference was that the accusation arose from \xe2\x80\x9cthe notice taken by a grand jury of any offence from their own knowledge or observation\xe2\x80\x9d rather than from a \xe2\x80\x9cbill of indictment laid before them.\xe2\x80\x9d  4 Blackstone *301.  The second was information, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only species of proceeding at the suit of the king, without a previous indictment or presentment by a grand jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at *308.  After an information was filed, it was \xe2\x80\x9ctried,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at *309, in the same way as an indictment: \xe2\x80\x9cThe same notice was given, the same process was issued, the same pleas were allowed, the same trial by jury was had, the same judgment was given by the same judges, as if the prosecution had originally been by indictment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at *310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0From the foregoing, the basic elements of a criminal \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d emerge with reasonable clarity.  \xe2\x80\x9cProsecution,\xe2\x80\x9d as Blackstone used the term, referred to \xe2\x80\x9cinstituting a criminal suit,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at *309, by filing a formal charging document\xe2\x80\x94an indictment, presentment, or information\xe2\x80\x94upon which the defendant was to be tried in a court with power to punish the alleged offense.  And, significantly, Blackstone\xe2\x80\x99s usage appears to have accorded with the ordinary meaning of the term.  See 2 N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1828) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d as \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he institution or commencement and continuance of a criminal suit; the process of exhibiting formal charges against an offender before a legal tribunal, and pursuing them to final judgment,\xe2\x80\x9d and noting that \xe2\x80\x9c<em>[p]rosecutions</em> may be by presentment, information or indictment\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With Blackstone as our guide, it is significant that the Framers used the words \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutions\xe2\x80\x9d in the Sixth Amendment rather than some other formulation such as \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal cases.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, elsewhere in the Bill of Rights we find just such an alternative formulation: In contrast to the Sixth Amendment, the Fifth Amendment refers to \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal case[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  U.

S. 547</a> (1892), the Court indicated that the difference in phraseology was not accidental.  There the Court held that the Fifth Amendment right not to be compelled to be a witness against oneself \xe2\x80\x9cin any criminal case\xe2\x80\x9d could be invoked by a witness testifying before a grand jury.  The Court rejected the argument that there could be no \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal case\xe2\x80\x9d prior to indictment, reasoning that a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal case\xe2\x80\x9d under the Fifth Amendment is much broader than a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d under the Sixth Amendment.  <em>Id</em>., at 563.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The following Term, the Court construed the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d in a statutory context, and this time the Court squarely held that a \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d does not encompass preindictment stages of the criminal process.  In <em>Virginia</em> v. <em>Paul</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/148/107/index.html">148 U. S. 107</a> (1893), the Court considered Revised Statute \xc2\xa7643, which authorized removal to federal court of any \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commenced in any court of a State\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d against a federal officer.  <em>Id</em>., at 115.  The respondent, a deputy marshal, had been arrested by Virginia authorities on a warrant for murder and was held in county jail awaiting his appearance before a justice of the peace \xe2\x80\x9cwith a view to a commitment to await the action of the grand jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 118.  He filed a petition for removal of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98said cause\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to federal court.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The question before the Court was whether a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98commenced\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of the statute at the time the respondent filed his removal petition.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court held that a criminal prosecution had not commenced, and that removal was therefore not authorized by the terms of the statute.  The Court noted that under Virginia law murder could be prosecuted only \xe2\x80\x9cby indictment found in the county court,\xe2\x80\x9d and that \xe2\x80\x9ca justice of the peace, upon a previous complaint, [could] do no more than to examine whether there [was] good cause for believing that the accused [was] guilty, and to commit him for trial before the court having jurisdiction of the offence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  Accordingly, where \xe2\x80\x9cno indictment was found, or other action taken, in the county court,\xe2\x80\x9d there was as yet no \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecution.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 119.  The appearance before the justice of the peace did not qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cProceedings before a magistrate to commit a person to jail, or to hold him to bail, in order to secure his appearance to answer for a crime or offence which the magistrate has no jurisdiction himself to try, before the court in which he may be prosecuted and tried, are but preliminary to the prosecution, and are no more a commencement of the prosecution, than is an arrest by an officer without a warrant for a felony committed in his presence.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The foregoing historical summary is strong evidence that the term \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n]\xe2\x80\x9d in the Sixth Amendment refers to the commencement of a criminal suit by filing formal charges in a court with jurisdiction to try and punish the defendant.  And on this understanding of the Sixth Amendment, it is clear that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance before the magistrate did not commence a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecutio[n].\xe2\x80\x9d  No formal charges had been filed.  The only document submitted to the magistrate was the arresting officer\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit of probable cause.  The officer stated that he \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] good reason to believe\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner was a felon and had been \xe2\x80\x9cwalking around [an] RV park with a gun belt on, carrying a pistol, handcuffs, mace spray, extra bullets and a knife.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 33a.  The officer therefore \xe2\x80\x9ccharge[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that petitioner had \xe2\x80\x9ccommit[ted] the offense of unlawful possession of a firearm by a felon\xe2\x80\x943rd degree felony.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.  The magistrate certified that he had examined the affidavit and \xe2\x80\x9cdetermined that probable cause existed for the arrest of the individual accused therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 34a.  Later that day, petitioner was released on bail, and did not hear from the State again until he was indicted six months later.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The affidavit of probable cause clearly was not the type of formal accusation Blackstone identified with the commencement of a criminal \xe2\x80\x9cprosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it was the preliminary accusation necessary to justify arrest and detention\xe2\x80\x94stages of the criminal process that Blackstone placed before prosecution.  The affidavit was not a pleading that instituted a criminal prosecution, such as an indictment, presentment, or information; and the magistrate to whom it was presented had no jurisdiction to try and convict petitioner for the felony offense charged therein.  See <em>Teal </em>v. <em>State</em>, 230 S.\xc2\xa0W. 3d 172, 174 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Texas Constitution requires that, unless waived by the defendant, the State must obtain a grand jury indictment in a felony case\xe2\x80\x9d); Tex. Crim. Proc. Code Ann., Arts. 4.05, 4.11(a) (West 2005).  That is most assuredly why the magistrate informed petitioner that charges \xe2\x80\x9c<em>will be </em>filed\xe2\x80\x9d in district court.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 35a (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The original meaning of the Sixth Amendment, then, cuts decisively against the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel attached at his initial appearance before the magistrate.  But we are not writing on a blank slate: This Court has a substantial body of more recent precedent construing the Sixth Amendment right to counsel.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As the Court notes, our cases have \xe2\x80\x9cpegged commencement\xe2\x80\x9d of a criminal prosecution, <em>ante</em>, at 5, to \xe2\x80\x9cthe initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x94whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Kirby</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/406/682/index.html">406 U. S. 682</a>, 689 (1972) (plurality opinion).  The Court has repeated this formulation in virtually every right-to-counsel case decided since <em>Kirby</em>.  Because <em>Kirby</em>\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of the attachment test has been accorded such precedential significance, it is important to determine precisely what <em>Kirby</em> said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIn a line of constitutional cases in this Court stemming back to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s landmark opinion in <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/287/45/index.html"></a><a href="/us/287/45/index.html">287 U.

The <em>Powell </em>case makes clear that the right attaches at the time of arraignment, and the Court has recently held that it exists also at the time of a preliminary hearing.  <em>Coleman</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <em>supra</em>.  But the point is that, while members of the Court have differed as to existence of the right to counsel in the contexts of some of the above cases, <em>all</em> of those cases have involved points of time at or after the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x94whether by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 688\xe2\x80\x93689 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is noteworthy that <em>Kirby</em> did not purport to announce anything new; rather, it simply catalogued what the Court had previously held.  And the point of the plurality\xe2\x80\x99s discussion was that the criminal process contains stages <em>prior to</em> commencement of a criminal prosecution.  The holding of the case was that the right to counsel did not apply at a station house lineup that took place \xe2\x80\x9c<em>before</em> the defendant had been indicted or otherwise formally charged with any criminal offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 684.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Kirby</em> gave five examples of events that initiate \xe2\x80\x9cadversary judicial criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d: formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, and arraignment.  None of these supports the result the Court reaches today.  I will apply them <em>seriatim</em>.  No indictment or information had been filed when petitioner appeared before the magistrate.  Nor was there any other formal charge.  Although the plurality in <em>Kirby</em> did not define \xe2\x80\x9cformal charge,\xe2\x80\x9d there is no reason to believe it would have included an affidavit of probable cause in that category.  None of the cases on which it relied stood for that proposition.  Indeed, all of them\xe2\x80\x94with the exception of <em>White</em> v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/59/index.html">373 U.

The comparable proceeding in Texas is called an \xe2\x80\x9cexamining trial.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ante</em>, at 9, n.\xc2\xa012.  More importantly, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance was unlike the preliminary hearings that were held to constitute \xe2\x80\x9ccritical stages\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>White </em>and <em>Coleman</em>, because it did not involve entry of a plea, cf. <em>White</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 60, and was nonadversarial, cf. <em>Coleman</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 9.  There was no prosecutor present, there were no witnesses to cross-examine, there was no case to discover, and the result of the proceeding was not to bind petitioner over to the grand jury or the trial court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance was not what <em>Kirby</em> described as an \xe2\x80\x9carraignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  An arraignment, in its traditional and usual sense, is a postindictment proceeding at which the defendant enters a plea.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, W.\xc2\xa0LaFave, J. Israel, &amp; N. King, Criminal Procedure \xc2\xa71.3(n), p. 19 (4th ed. 2004); 4 Blackstone *322.  Although the word \xe2\x80\x9carraignment\xe2\x80\x9d is sometimes used to describe an initial appearance before a magistrate, see LaFave, <em>supra</em>, \xc2\xa71.3(j), at 16, that is not what <em>Kirby</em> meant when it said that the right to counsel attaches at an \xe2\x80\x9carraignment.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, it meant the traditional, postindictment arraignment where the defendant enters a plea.  This would be the most reasonable assumption even if there were nothing else to go on, since that is the primary meaning of the word, especially when used unmodified.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But there is no need to assume.  <em>Kirby</em> purported to describe only what the Court had already held, and none of the cases <em>Kirby</em> cited involved an initial appearance.  Only two of the cases involved arraignments, and both were postindictment arraignments at which the defendant entered a plea.  <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 53, n.\xc2\xa03; <em>Powell</em>, 287 U. S., at 49.  And the considerations that drove the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis in those cases are not present here.  See <em>id., </em>at 57 (emphasizing that \xe2\x80\x9cfrom the time of their arraignment until the beginning of their trial, when consultation, thoroughgoing investigation and preparation were vitally important, the defendants did not have the aid of counsel\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 53\xe2\x80\x9355 (emphasizing that the defendant entered a plea and was required to raise or waive certain defenses).  <em>Kirby</em>\xe2\x80\x99s inclusion of \xe2\x80\x9carraignment\xe2\x80\x9d in the list of adversary judicial proceedings that trigger the right to counsel thus provides no support for the view that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is clear that when <em>Kirby</em> was decided in 1972 there was no precedent in this Court for the conclusion that a criminal prosecution begins, and the right to counsel therefore attaches, at an initial appearance before a magistrate.  The Court concludes, however, that two subsequent decisions\xe2\x80\x94<em>Brewer</em> v. <em>Williams</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/430/387/index.html">430 U. S. 387</a> (1977), and <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Jackson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/475/625/index.html">475 U. S. 625</a> (1986)\xe2\x80\x94stand for that proposition.  Those decisions, which relied almost exclusively on <em>Kirby</em>, cannot bear the weight the Court puts on them.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Brewer</em>, the defendant challenged his conviction for murdering a 10-year-old girl on the ground that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel had been violated when detectives elicited incriminating statements from him while transporting him from Davenport, Iowa, where he had been arrested on a warrant for abduction and \xe2\x80\x9carraigned before a judge \xe2\x80\xa6 on the outstanding arrest warrant,\xe2\x80\x9d to Des Moines, where he was to be tried.  430 U. S., at 390\xe2\x80\x93391.  The principal issue was whether the defendant had waived his right to have counsel present during police questioning when he voluntarily engaged one of the detectives in a \xe2\x80\x9cwide-ranging conversation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 392.  He subsequently agreed to lead the detectives to the girl\xe2\x80\x99s body in response to the so-called \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98Christian burial speech,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d in which one of the detectives told the defendant that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the parents of this little girl should be entitled to a Christian burial for the little girl who was snatched away from them on Christmas [E]ve and murdered.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.  Not surprisingly, the parties vigorously disputed the waiver issue, and it sharply divided the Court.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In contrast, the question whether the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel had attached was neither raised in the courts below nor disputed before this Court.  Nonetheless, the Court, after quoting <em>Kirby</em>\xe2\x80\x99s formulation of the test, offered its conclusory observations:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThere can be no doubt in the present case that judicial proceedings had been initiated against Williams before the start of the automobile ride from Davenport to Des Moines.  A warrant had been issued for his arrest, he had been arraigned on that warrant before a judge in a Davenport courtroom, and he had been committed by the court to confinement in jail.  The State does not contend otherwise.\xe2\x80\x9d  430 U. S., at 399.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Brewer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s cursory treatment of the attachment issue demonstrates precisely why, when \xe2\x80\x9can issue [is] not addressed by the parties,\xe2\x80\x9d it is \xe2\x80\x9cimprudent of us to address it \xe2\x80\xa6 with any pretense of settling it for all time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Metropolitan Stevedore Co.</em> v. <em>Rambo</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/521/121/index.html">521 U. S. 121</a>, 136 (1997).  As an initial matter, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the facts reveals little about what happened at the proceeding.  There is no indication, for example, whether it was adversarial or whether the defendant was required to enter a plea or raise or waive any defenses\xe2\x80\x94facts that earlier cases such as <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>White</em>, and <em>Coleman </em>had found significant.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Even assuming, however, that the arraignment in <em>Brewer</em> was functionally identical to the initial appearance here, <em>Brewer</em> offered no reasoning for its conclusion that the right to counsel attached at such a proceeding.  One is left with the distinct impression that the Court simply saw the word \xe2\x80\x9carraignment\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Kirby</em>\xe2\x80\x99s attachment test and concluded that the right must have attached because the defendant had been \xe2\x80\x9carraigned.\xe2\x80\x9d  There is no indication that <em>Brewer </em>considered the difference between an arraignment on a warrant and an arraignment at which the defendant pleads to the indictment.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court finds it significant that <em>Brewer</em> expressed \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98no doubt\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that the right had attached.  <em>Ante</em>, at 19 (quoting 430 U. S., at 399).  There was no need for a \xe2\x80\x9clengthy disquisitio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d the Court says, because <em>Brewer</em> purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cfound the attachment issue an easy one.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  What the Court neglects to mention is that <em>Brewer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s attachment holding is indisputably no longer good law.  That is because we have subsequently held that the Sixth Amendment right to counsel is \xe2\x80\x9coffense specific,\xe2\x80\x9d meaning that it attaches only to those offenses for which the defendant has been formally charged, and not to \xe2\x80\x9cother offenses \xe2\x80\x98closely related factually\xe2\x80\x99 to the charged offense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Texas</em> v. <em>Cobb</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/162/index.html">532 U. S. 162</a>, 164 (2001).  Because the defendant in <em>Brewer </em>had been arraigned only on the abduction warrant, there is no doubt that, under <em>Cobb</em>, his right to counsel had not yet attached with respect to the murder charges that were subsequently brought.  See 532 U. S., at 184 (Breyer, J., dissenting) (noting that under the majority\xe2\x80\x99s rule, \xe2\x80\x9c[the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] murder conviction should have remained undisturbed\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the Court in <em>Cobb</em> did not consider itself bound by <em>Brewer</em>\xe2\x80\x99s implicit holding on the attachment question.  See 532 U. S., at 169 (\xe2\x80\x9cConstitutional rights are not defined by inferences from opinions which did not address the question at issue\xe2\x80\x9d).  And here, as in <em>Cobb</em>,<em> Brewer</em> did not address the fact that the arraignment on the warrant was not the same type of arraignment at which the right to counsel had previously been held to attach, and the parties did not argue the question.  <em>Brewer</em> is thus entitled to no more precedential weight here than it was in <em>Cobb</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor does <em>Jackson</em> control.  In <em>Jackson</em>, as in <em>Brewer</em>, the attachment issue was secondary.  The question presented was \xe2\x80\x9cnot whether respondents had a right to counsel at their postarraignment, custodial interrogations,\xe2\x80\x9d 475 U. S., at 629, but \xe2\x80\x9cwhether respondents validly waived their right to counsel,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 630.  And, as in <em>Brewer</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s waiver holding was vigorously disputed.  See 475 U. S., at 637\xe2\x80\x93642 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting); see also <em>Cobb, supra</em>, at 174\xe2\x80\x93177 (Kennedy, J., concurring) (questioning <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s vitality).  Unlike in <em>Brewer</em>, however, the attachment question was at least contested in <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x94but barely.  With respect to respondent Jackson, the State conceded the issue.  <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 629, n.\xc2\xa03.  And with respect to respondent Bladel, the State had conceded the issue below, see <em>People</em> v. <em>Bladel</em>, 421 Mich. 39, 77, 365 N.\xc2\xa0W. 2d 56, 74 (1984) (Boyle, J., dissenting), and raised it for the first time before this Court, devoting only three pages of its brief to the question, see Brief for Petitioner in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bladel</em>, O. T. 1985, No. 84\xe2\x80\x931539, pp. 24\xe2\x80\x9326.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court disposed of the issue in a footnote.  See <em>Jackson</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 629\xe2\x80\x93630, n.\xc2\xa03.  As in <em>Brewer</em>, the Court did not describe the nature of the proceeding.  It stated only that the respondents were \xe2\x80\x9carraigned.\xe2\x80\x9d  475 U. S., at 627\xe2\x80\x93628.  The Court phrased the question presented in terms of \xe2\x80\x9carraignment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 626 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe question presented by these two cases is whether the same rule applies to a defendant who has been formally charged with a crime and who has requested appointment of counsel at his arraignment\xe2\x80\x9d), and repeated the words \xe2\x80\x9carraignment\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpostarraignment\xe2\x80\x9d no fewer than 35 times in the course of its opinion.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no way to know from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in <em>Jackson </em>whether the arraignment at issue there was the same type of arraignment at which the right to counsel had been held to attach in <em>Powell</em> and <em>Hamilton</em>.  Only upon examination of the parties\xe2\x80\x99 briefs does it become clear that the proceeding was in fact an initial appearance.  But <em>Jackson </em>did not even acknowledge, much less \xe2\x80\x9cflatly rejec[t] the distinction between initial arraignment and arraignment on the indictment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  Instead, it offered one sentence of analysis\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cIn view of the clear language in our decisions about the significance of arraignment, the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument is untenable\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94followed by a string citation to four cases, each of which quoted <em>Kirby</em>.  475 U. S., at 629\xe2\x80\x93630, n.\xc2\xa03.  For emphasis, the Court italicized the words \xe2\x80\x9cor arraignment\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>Kirby</em>\xe2\x80\x99s attachment test.  475 U. S., at 629, n.\xc2\xa03 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only rule that can be derived from the face of the opinion in <em>Jackson</em> is that if a proceeding is called an \xe2\x80\x9carraignment,\xe2\x80\x9d the right to counsel attaches.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That rule would not govern this case because petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance was not called an \xe2\x80\x9carraignment\xe2\x80\x9d (the parties refer to it as a \xe2\x80\x9cmagistration\xe2\x80\x9d).  And that would, in any case, be a silly rule.  The Sixth Amendment consequences of a proceeding should turn on the substance of what happens there, not on what the State chooses to call it.  But the Court in <em>Jackson </em>did not focus on the substantive distinction between an initial arraignment and an arraignment on the indictment.  Instead, the Court simply cited <em>Kirby </em>and left it at that.  In these circumstances, I would recognize <em>Jackson</em> for what it was\xe2\x80\x94a cursory treatment of an issue that was not the primary focus of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  Surely <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s footnote must yield to our reasoned precedents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And our reasoned precedents provide no support for the conclusion that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate.  <em>Kirby</em> explained why the right attaches \xe2\x80\x9cafter the initiation of adversary judicial criminal proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe initiation of judicial criminal proceedings is far from a mere formalism.  It is the starting point of our whole system of adversary criminal justice.  For it is only then that the government has committed itself to prosecute, and only then that the adverse positions of government and defendant have solidified.  It is then that a defendant finds himself faced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society, and immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law.  It is this point, therefore, that marks the commencement of the \xe2\x80\x98criminal prosecutions\xe2\x80\x99 to which alone the explicit guarantees of the Sixth Amendment are applicable.\xe2\x80\x9d  406 U. S., at 689\xe2\x80\x93690 (plurality opinion).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0None of these defining characteristics of a \xe2\x80\x9ccriminal prosecution\xe2\x80\x9d applies to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s initial appearance before the magistrate.  The initial appearance was not an \xe2\x80\x9cadversary\xe2\x80\x9d proceeding, and petitioner was not \xe2\x80\x9cfaced with the prosecutorial forces of organized society.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, he stood in front of a \xe2\x80\x9clittle glass window,\xe2\x80\x9d filled out various forms, and was read his <em>Miranda </em>rights.  Brief for Respondent 5.  The State had not committed itself to prosecute\xe2\x80\x94only a prosecutor may file felony charges in Texas, see Tex. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. Arts. 2.01, 2.02 (West 2005), and there is no evidence that any prosecutor was even aware of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s arrest or appearance.  The adverse positions of government and defendant had not yet solidified\xe2\x80\x94the State\xe2\x80\x99s prosecutorial officers had not yet decided whether to press charges and, if so, which charges to press.  And petitioner was not immersed in the intricacies of substantive and procedural criminal law\xe2\x80\x94shortly after the proceeding he was free on bail, and no further proceedings occurred until six months later when he was indicted.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance is untethered from any interest that we have heretofore associated with the right to counsel.  The Court has repeatedly emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he purpose of the constitutional guaranty of a right to counsel is to protect an accused from conviction resulting from his own ignorance of his legal and constitutional rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Johnson</em>, 304 U. S., at 465.  The \xe2\x80\x9ccore purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the right, the Court has said, is to \xe2\x80\x9cassure \xe2\x80\x98Assistance\xe2\x80\x99 at trial, when the accused [is] confronted with both the intricacies of the law and the advocacy of the public prosecutor.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Ash</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/413/300/index.html">413 U. S. 300</a>, 309 (1973).  The Court has extended the right to counsel to pretrial events only when the absence of counsel would derogate from the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s right to a fair trial.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Wade</em>, 388 U. S., at 227.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Neither petitioner nor the Court identifies any way in which petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s ability to receive a fair trial was undermined by the absence of counsel during the period between his initial appearance and his indictment.  Nothing during that period exposed petitioner to the risk that he would be convicted as the result of ignorance of his rights.  Instead, the gravamen of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s complaint is that if counsel had been appointed earlier, he would have been able to stave off indictment by convincing the prosecutor that petitioner was not guilty of the crime alleged.  But the Sixth Amendment protects against the risk of erroneous <em>conviction</em>, not the risk of unwarranted <em>prosecution</em>.  See <em>Gouveia</em>, 467 U. S., at 191 (rejecting the notion that the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose of the right to counsel is to provide a defendant with a preindictment private investigator\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner argues that the right to counsel is implicated here because restrictions were imposed on his liberty when he was required to post bail.  But we have never suggested that the accused\xe2\x80\x99s right to the assistance of counsel \xe2\x80\x9cfor his defence\xe2\x80\x9d entails a right to use counsel as a sword to contest pretrial detention.  To the contrary, we have flatly rejected that notion, reasoning that a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interests are protected by other constitutional guarantees.  See <em>id.</em>, at 190 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhile the right to counsel exists to protect the accused during trial-type confrontations with the prosecutor, the speedy trial right exists primarily to protect an individual\xe2\x80\x99s liberty interest,\xe2\x80\x9d including the interest in reducing the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98impairment of liberty imposed on an accused while released on bail\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In sum, neither the original meaning of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel nor our precedents interpreting the scope of that right supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the right attaches at an initial appearance before a magistrate.  Because I would affirm the judgment below, \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court also relies on <em>McNeil</em> v. <em>Wisconsin</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/501/171/index.html"></a><a href="/us/501/171/index.html">501 U. S. 171</a> (1991), to support its assertion that the right to counsel attaches upon an initial appearance before a magistrate.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But in <em>McNeil</em>, the Court expressed no view whatsoever on the attachment issue.  Rather, it noted that the issue was \xe2\x80\x9cundisputed,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9caccept[ed] for purposes of the present case, that \xe2\x80\xa6 [the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s] Sixth Amendment right had attached.\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U. S., at 175.  We do not ordinarily give weight to assumptions made in prior cases about matters that were not in dispute.</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court asserts that <em>Jackson</em>\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cconclusion was driven by the same considerations the Court had endorsed in <em>Brewer</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, that \xe2\x80\x9cby the time a defendant is brought before a judicial officer, is informed of a formally lodged accusation, and has restrictions imposed on his liberty in aid of the prosecution, the State\xe2\x80\x99s relationship with the defendant has become solidly adversarial.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  But <em>Jackson </em>said nothing of the sort.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, even looking behind the opinion, <em>Jackson</em> does not support the result the Court reaches today.  Respondent Bladel entered a \xe2\x80\x9cnot guilty\xe2\x80\x9d plea at his arraignment, see Brief for Petitioner in <em>Michigan</em> v. <em>Bladel</em>, O. T. 1985, No. 84\xe2\x80\x931539, p.\xc2\xa04, and both <em>Hamilton</em> v. <em>Alabama</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/368/52/index.html"></a><a href="/us/368/52/index.html"></a><a href="/us/368/52/index.html">368 U. S. 52</a> (1961), and <em>White </em>v. <em>Maryland</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/373/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/59/index.html"></a><a href="/us/373/59/index.html">373 U. S. 59</a> (1963) <em>(per curiam)</em>, had already held that a defendant has a right to counsel when he enters a plea.  The Court suggests that this fact is irrelevant because the magistrate in Bladel\xe2\x80\x99s case \xe2\x80\x9chad no jurisdiction to accept a plea of guilty to a felony charge.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10, n.\xc2\xa013.  But that distinction does not appear in either <em>Hamilton </em>or <em>White</em>.  See <em>Hamilton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 55 (\xe2\x80\x9cOnly the presence of counsel could have enabled this accused to know all the defenses available to him and to plead intelligently\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>White</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 60 (\xe2\x80\x9c[P]etitioner entered a plea before the magistrate and that plea was taken at a time when he had no counsel\xe2\x80\x9d).  Thus, the most that <em>Jackson</em> can possibly be made to stand for is that the right to counsel attaches at an initial appearance where the defendant enters a plea.  And that rule would not govern this case because petitioner did not enter a plea at his initial appearance.</p>\n</casctfnt>\n</div>\n</div>\n</font></font></font></font></div>'
