WYNER<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">SOLE, SECRETARY, FLORIDA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, et\xc2\xa0al. <em>v</em>. WYNER et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 06\xe2\x80\x93531.\xe2\x80\x83Argued April 17, 2007\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 4, 2007</p>\n<p align="left">In private actions under 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983, federal district courts may \xe2\x80\x9callow the prevailing party \xe2\x80\xa6 a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa71988(b).  Plaintiff-respondent Wyner notified the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), in mid-January 2003, of her intention to create on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, within MacArthur State Beach Park, an antiwar artwork consisting of nude individuals assembled into a peace sign.  Responding on February 6, DEP informed Wyner that her display would be lawful only if the participants complied with Florida\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cBathing Suit Rule,\xe2\x80\x9d which requires patrons of state parks to wear, at a minimum, a thong and, if female, a bikini top.  To safeguard her display, and future nude expressive activities, against police interference, Wyner and a coplaintiff (collectively Wyner or plaintiff) sued Florida officials in the Federal District Court on February 12.  Invoking the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection of expressive conduct, Wyner requested immediate injunctive relief against interference with the peace sign display and permanent injunctive relief against interference with future activities similarly involving nudity.  An attachment to the complaint set out a 1995 settlement with DEP permitting Wyner to stage a play with nude performers at MacArthur Beach provided the area was screened off to shield beachgoers who did not wish to see the play.  Although disconcerted by the hurried character of the proceeding, the District Court granted Wyner a preliminary injunction on February 13, suggesting that a curtain or screen could satisfy the interests of both the State and Wyner.  The peace symbol display that took place the next day was set up outside a barrier apparently put up by the State.  Once disassembled from the peace symbol formation, participants went into the water in the nude.  Thereafter, Wyner pursued her demand for a permanent injunction, noting that she intended to put on another Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day production at MacArthur Beach, again involving nudity.  After discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.  At a January 21, 2004 hearing, Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel acknowledged that the peace symbol display participants had set up in front of the barrier.  The court denied plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment and granted defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary final judgment.  The deliberate failure of Wyner and her coparticipants to stay behind the screen at the 2003 Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day display, the court concluded, demonstrated that the Bathing Suit Rule\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of nudity was essential to protect the visiting public.  While Wyner ultimately failed to prevail on the merits, the court added, she did obtain a preliminary injunction, and therefore qualified as a prevailing party to that extent.  Reasoning that the preliminary injunction could not be revisited at the second stage of the litigation because it had expired, the court awarded plaintiff counsel fees covering the first phase of the litigation.  The Florida officials appealed, challenging both the preliminary injunction and the counsel fees award.  The Eleventh Circuit held first that defendants\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the preliminary injunction were moot.  The court then affirmed the counsel fees award, reasoning that the preliminary order allowed Wyner to present the peace symbol display unimpeded by adverse state action.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Prevailing party status does not attend achievement of a preliminary injunction that is reversed, dissolved, or otherwise undone by the final decision in the same case.  Pp.  6\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe touchstone of the prevailing party inquiry\xe2\x80\x9d this Court has stated, is \xe2\x80\x9cthe material alteration of the legal relationship of the parties in a manner which Congress sought to promote in the fee statute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Texas State Teachers Assn.</em> v. <em>Garland Independent School Dist.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/489/782/index.html">489 U. S. 782</a>, 792\xe2\x80\x93793.  At the preliminary injunction stage, the court is called upon to assess the probability of the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s ultimate success on the merits.  The foundation for that assessment will be more or less secure depending on the thoroughness of the exploration undertaken by the parties and the court.  In this case, the preliminary injunction hearing was necessarily hasty and abbreviated.  There was no time for discovery, nor for adequate review of documents or preparation and presentation of witnesses.  The provisional relief granted expired before appellate review could be gained, and the court\xe2\x80\x99s threshold ruling would have no preclusive effect in the continuing litigation, as both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered the preliminary injunction moot once the display took place.  The provisional relief\xe2\x80\x99s tentative character, in view of the continuation of the litigation to definitively resolve the controversy, would have made a fee request at the initial stage premature.  Of controlling importance, the eventual ruling on the merits for defendants, after both sides considered the case fit for final adjudication, superseded the preliminary ruling.  Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s temporary success rested on a premise\xe2\x80\x94the understanding that a curtain or screen would adequately serve Florida\xe2\x80\x99s interest in shielding the public from nudity\xe2\x80\x94that the District Court, with the benefit of a fuller record, ultimately rejected.  Wyner contends that the preliminary injunction was not undermined by the subsequent merits adjudication because the decision to grant preliminary relief was an \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d ruling based on the officials\xe2\x80\x99 impermissible content-based administration of the Bathing Suit Rule.  But the District Court assumed content neutrality for purposes of its preliminary order.  The final decision in Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s case rejected the same claim she advanced in her preliminary injunction motion: that the state law banning nudity in parks was unconstitutional as applied to expressive, nonerotic nudity.  At the end of the fray, Florida\xe2\x80\x99s Bathing Suit Rule remained intact.  Wyner had gained no enduring \xe2\x80\x9cchang[e] [in] the legal relationship\xe2\x80\x9d between herself and the state officials she sued.  See <em>Texas State Teachers Assn.</em>, 489 U. S., at 792.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9310.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Wyner is not a prevailing party, for her initial victory was ephemeral.  This Court expresses no view on whether, in the absence of a final decision on the merits of a claim for permanent injunctive relief, success in gaining a preliminary injunction may sometimes warrant an award of counsel fees.  It decides only that a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction does not qualify for an award of counsel fees under \xc2\xa71988(b) if the merits of the case are ultimately decided against her.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71983 and other specified measures designed to secure civil rights, Congress established an exception to the \xe2\x80\x9cAmerican Rule\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cthe prevailing litigant is ordinarily not entitled to collect [counsel fees] from the loser.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.</em> v. <em>Wilderness Society</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/421/240/index.html">421 U. S. 240</a>, 247 (1975).  That exception, codified in 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71988(b), authorizes federal district courts, in their discretion, to \xe2\x80\x9callow the prevailing party . . . a reasonable attorney\xe2\x80\x99s fee as part of the costs.\xe2\x80\x9d  This case presents a sole question: Does a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction after an abbreviated hearing, but is denied a permanent injunction after a dispositive adjudication on the merits, qualify as a \xe2\x80\x9cprevailing party\xe2\x80\x9d within the compass of \xc2\xa71988(b)?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Viewing the two stages of the litigation as discrete episodes, plaintiffs below, respondents here, maintain that they prevailed at the preliminary injunction stage, and therefore qualify for a fee award for their counsels\xe2\x80\x99 efforts to obtain that interim relief.  Defendants below, petitioners here, regard the case as a unit; they urge that a preliminary injunction holds no sway once fuller consideration yields rejection of the provisional order\xe2\x80\x99s legal or factual underpinnings.  We agree with the latter position and hold that a final decision on the merits denying permanent injunctive relief ordinarily determines who prevails in the action for purposes of \xc2\xa71988(b).  A plaintiff who achieves a transient victory at the threshold of an action can gain no award under that fee-shifting provision if, at the end of the litigation, her initial success is undone and she leaves the courthouse emptyhanded.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In mid-January 2003, plaintiff-respondent T. A. Wyner notified the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) of her intention to create on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day, February 14, 2003, within John D. MacArthur Beach State Park, an antiwar artwork.  The work would consist of nude individuals assembled into a peace sign.  By letter dated February 6, DEP informed Wyner that her peace sign display would be lawful only if the participants complied with the \xe2\x80\x9cBathing Suit Rule\xe2\x80\x9d set out in Florida Administrative Code \xc2\xa762D\xe2\x80\x932.014(7)(b) (2005).  That rule required patrons, in all areas of Florida\xe2\x80\x99s state parks, to wear, at a minimum, a thong and, if female, a bikini top.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To safeguard the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day display, and future expressive activities of the same order, against police interference, Wyner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida on February 12, 2003.  She invoked the First Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection of expressive conduct, and named as defendants the Secretary of DEP and the Manager of MacArthur Beach Park.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  Her complaint requested immediate injunctive relief against interference with the peace sign display, App. 18, and permanent injunctive relief against interference with \xe2\x80\x9cfuture expressive activities that may include non-erotic displays of nude human bodies,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 19.  An exhibit attached to the complaint set out a May 12, 1995 Stipulation for Settlement with DEP.  <em>Id</em>., at 22\xe2\x80\x9323.  That settlement had facilitated a February 19, 1996 play Wyner coordinated at MacArthur Beach, a production involving nude performers.  A term of the settlement provided that Wyner would \xe2\x80\x9carrange for placement of a bolt of cloth in a semi-circle around the area where the play [would]\nbe performed,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 23, so that beachgoers who did not wish to see the play would be shielded from the nude performers.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The day after the complaint was filed, on February 13, 2003, the District Court heard Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s emergency motion for a preliminary injunction.  Although disconcerted by the hurried character of the proceeding, see <em>id</em>., at 37, 93, 95, the court granted the preliminary injunction.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe choice,\xe2\x80\x9d the court explained, \xe2\x80\x9cneed not be either/or.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyner</em> v. <em>Struhs</em>, 254 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1297, 1303 (SD Fla. 2003).  Pointing to the May 1995 settlement laying out \xe2\x80\x9cagreed-upon manner restrictions,\xe2\x80\x9d the court determined that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]laintiff[\xe2\x80\x99s] desired expression and the interests of the state may both be satisfied simultaneously.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  In this regard, the court had inquired of DEP\xe2\x80\x99s counsel at the preliminary injunction hearing: \xe2\x80\x9cWhy wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t the curtain or screen solve the problem of somebody [who] doesn\xe2\x80\x99t want to see . . . nudity?  Seems like that would solve [the] problem, wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t it?\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 86.  Counsel for DEP responded:  \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s an option.  I don\xe2\x80\x99t think necessarily [defendants] would be opposed to that \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.<em>;</em> see <em>id.</em>, at 74 (testimony of Chief of Operations for Florida Park Service at the preliminary injunction hearing that the Service\xe2\x80\x99s counsel, on prior occasions, had advised: \xe2\x80\x9c[I]f they go behind the screen and they liv[e] up to the agreement then it\xe2\x80\x99s okay.  If they don\xe2\x80\x99t go behind the screen and they don\xe2\x80\x99t live up to the agreement then it\xe2\x80\x99s not okay.\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The peace symbol display took place at MacArthur Beach the next day.  A screen was put up, apparently by the State, as the District Court anticipated.  See <em>id</em>., at 108.  See also <em>id.</em>, at 94 (District Judge\xe2\x80\x99s statement at the conclusion of the preliminary injunction hearing:  \xe2\x80\x9cI want to make it clear . . . that the [preliminary] injunction doesn\xe2\x80\x99t preclude the department, if it chooses, from using \xe2\x80\xa6 some sort of barrier . . . .\xe2\x80\x9d).  But the display was set up outside the barrier, and participants, once disassembled from the peace symbol formation, went into the water in the nude.  See <em>id</em>., at 108; Deposition of T. A. Wyner in Civ. Action No. 03\xe2\x80\x9380103 (SD Fla., Nov. 14, 2003), pp.\xe2\x80\x8299\xe2\x80\x93100.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Thereafter, Wyner pursued her demand for a permanent injunction.  Her counsel represented that on February 14, 2004, Wyner intended to put on another production at MacArthur Beach, again involving nudity.  See App. 107.  After discovery, both sides moved for summary judgment.  At the hearing on the motions, held January 21, 2004, the District Court asked Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel about the screen put up around the preceding year\xe2\x80\x99s peace symbol display.  Counsel acknowledged that the participants in that display ignored the barrier and set up in front of the screen.  <em>Id</em>., at 108.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A week later, having unsuccessfully urged the parties to resolve the case as \xe2\x80\x9c[they] did before in [the 1995] settlement,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 143, the court denied plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s motion for summary judgment and granted defendants\xe2\x80\x99 motion for summary final judgment.  The deliberate failure of Wyner and her coparticipants to remain behind the screen at the 2003 Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day display, the court concluded, demonstrated that the Bathing Suit Rule\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of nudity was \xe2\x80\x9cno greater than is essential . . . to protect the experiences of the visiting public.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyner</em> v. <em>Struhs</em>, Case No. 03\xe2\x80\x9380103\xe2\x80\x93CIV (SD Fla., Jan. 28, 2004) (Summary Judgment Order), App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  While Wyner ultimately failed to prevail on the merits, the court added, she did obtain a preliminary injunction prohibiting police interference with the Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day 2003 temporary art installation, <em>id</em>., at 45a, and therefore qualified as a prevailing party to that extent, see <em>Wyner </em>v. <em>Struhs</em>, Case No. 03\xe2\x80\x9380103\xe2\x80\x93CIV (SD Fla., Aug. 16, 2004) (Omnibus Order),<em> </em>App. to Brief in Opposition 5a\xe2\x80\x9313a.  The preliminary injunction could not be revisited at the second stage of the litigation, the court noted, for it had \xe2\x80\x9cexpired on its own terms.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 4a.  So reasoning, the court awarded plaintiff counsel fees covering the first phase of the litigation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Florida officials appealed, challenging both the order granting a preliminary injunction and the award of counsel fees.  Wyner, however, pursued no appeal from the final order denying a permanent injunction.  The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit held first that defendants\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the preliminary injunction were moot because they addressed \xe2\x80\x9ca finite event that occurred and ended on a specific, past date.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wyner </em>v. <em>Struhs</em>, 179 Fed. Appx. 566, 567, n.\xc2\xa01 (2006) <em>(per curiam)</em>.  The court then affirmed the counsel fees award, reasoning that plaintiff had gained through the preliminary injunction \xe2\x80\x9cthe primary relief [she] sought,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, the preliminary order allowed her to present the peace symbol display unimpeded by adverse state action.  <em>Id.</em>, at 569.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyner would not have qualified for an award of counsel fees, the court recognized, had the preliminary injunction rested on a mistake of law.  <em>Id.</em>, at 568, 569\xe2\x80\x93570.  But it was \xe2\x80\x9cnew developments,\xe2\x80\x9d the court said, <em>id</em>., at 569, not any legal error, that accounted for her failure \xe2\x80\x9cto achieve actual success on the merits at the permanent injunction stage,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 569, n.\xc2\xa07.  Plaintiff and others participating in the display, as Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel admitted, did not stay behind the barrier at the peace symbol display, <em>id.</em>, at 569; further, the court noted, \xe2\x80\x9ca fair reading of the record show[ed] that [p]laintif[f] had no intention of remaining behind a [barrier] during future nude expressive works,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid</em>.  The likelihood of success shown at the preliminary injunction stage, the court explained, <em>id.</em>, at 569, n.\xc2\xa07, had been overtaken by the subsequent \xe2\x80\x9cdemonstrat[ion] that the less restrictive alternative,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, a cloth screen or other barrier, \xe2\x80\x9cwas not sufficient to protect the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 569.  But that demonstration, the court concluded, did not bar an award of fees, because the \xe2\x80\x9cnew facts\xe2\x80\x9d emerged only at the summary judgment stage.  <em>Ibid</em>.

The provisional relief immediately granted expired before appellate review could be gained, and the court\xe2\x80\x99s threshold ruling would have no preclusive effect in the continuing litigation.  Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals considered the preliminary injunction a moot issue, not fit for reexamination or review, once the display took place.  See Summary Judgment Order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 34a; Omnibus Order, App. to Brief in Opposition 3a\xe2\x80\x934a; 179 Fed. Appx., at 567, n. 1; cf. <em>Lewis</em> v. <em>Continental Bank Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/472/index.html">494 U. S. 472</a>, 477\xe2\x80\x93479 (1990).  In short, the provisional relief granted terminated only the parties\xe2\x80\x99 opening engagement.  Its tentative character, in view of the continuation of the litigation to definitively resolve the controversy, would have made a fee request at the initial stage premature.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of controlling importance to our decision, the eventual ruling on the merits for defendants, after both sides considered the case fit for final adjudication, superseded the preliminary ruling.  Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s temporary success rested on a premise the District Court ultimately rejected.  That court granted preliminary relief on the understanding that a curtain or screen would adequately serve Florida\xe2\x80\x99s interest in shielding the public from nudity that recreational beach users did not wish to see.  See <em>supra</em>, at<font b="1"> 3\xe2\x80\x934; 254 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1303 (noting that the parties had previously agreed upon \xe2\x80\x9ca number of . . . manner restrictions that are far less restrictive than the total ban on nudity\xe2\x80\x9d).  At the summary judgment stage, with the benefit of a fuller record, the District Court recognized that its initial assessment was incorrect.  Participants in the peace symbol display were in fact unwilling to stay behind a screen that separated them from other park visitors.  See Summary Judgment Order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 42a.  See also App. 108 (acknowledgment by Wyner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel that participants in the February 14, 2003 protest \xe2\x80\x9cin effec[t] ignored the screen\xe2\x80\x9d).  In light of the demonstrated inadequacy of the screen to contain the nude display, the District Court determined that enforcement of the Bathing Suit Rule was necessary to \xe2\x80\x9cpreserv[e] park aesthetics\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cprotect the experiences of the visiting public.\xe2\x80\x9d  Summary Judgment Order, App. to Pet. for Cert. 41a, 42a.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Wyner contends that the preliminary injunction was not undermined by the subsequent adjudication on the merits because the decision to grant preliminary relief was an \xe2\x80\x9cas applied\xe2\x80\x9d ruling.  In developing this argument, she asserts that the officials engaged in impermissible content-based administration of the Bathing Suit Rule.  But the District Court assumed, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the purposes of [its initial] order,\xe2\x80\x9d the content neutrality of the state officials\xe2\x80\x99 conduct.  See 254 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1302.  See also 179 Fed. Appx., at 568, and n. 4 (reiterating that, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sake of the preliminary injunction order,\xe2\x80\x9d the District Court \xe2\x80\x9cassumed content neutrality\xe2\x80\x9d).  That specification is controlling.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(d) (requiring every injunction to \xe2\x80\x9cset forth the reasons for its issuance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbe specific in terms\xe2\x80\x9d).
