His conviction became final on direct review on May 29, 1996.  In addition to his direct appeal, he filed two relevant state motions.  One, a May 16, 1996, motion to reduce his sentence under Rhode Island Superior Court Rule of Criminal Procedure 35, was denied.  The State Supreme Court affirmed on January 16, 1998.  The second, a state postconviction relief motion, was also denied.  That decision was affirmed on December 14, 2006.  When respondent filed his federal habeas petition, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.  The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA) generally requires a federal petition to be filed within one year of the date on which a judgment became final, 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A), but \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d tolls that period, \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s postconviction relief motion tolled the period for over nine years, but his Rule 35 motion must also trigger the tolling provision for his habeas petition to be timely.  The District Court dismissed the petition as untimely, adopting the Magistrate Judge\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the Rule 35 motion was not \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for \xe2\x80\xa6 collateral review\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).

By definition, \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d describes something that is \xe2\x80\x9cindirect,\xe2\x80\x9d not direct.  3 Oxford English Dictionary 473.  This suggests that \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d review is not part of direct review.  This conclusion is supported by the definition of the related phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral attack\xe2\x80\x9d and by the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior use of the term \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d to describe proceedings that are separate from the direct review process.

Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 35 is similar to the version of Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 35 in effect before the federal Sentencing Reform Act of 1984.  The Rule permits a court to provide relief, as relevant here, to \xe2\x80\x9creduce any sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d and it is generally addressed to the sound discretion of the sentencing justice.  Under the limited review available, an appellate court may disturb the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s decision if the sentence imposed is without justification and is grossly disparate when compared to sentences for similar offenses.  Pp.\xc2\xa08\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Keeping these principles in mind, a Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  The parties agree that the motion is not part of the direct review process, and both this Court and lower federal courts have described a motion to reduce sentence under old Federal Rule 35 as invoking a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d remedy.  Therefore, it is not difficult to conclude that Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s motion to reduce sentence is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  A Rule 35 motion also calls for \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d of the sentence within \xc2\xa72244(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s meaning.  The decision to reduce a sentence involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.  The trial justice is guided by several sentencing factors in making that decision.  And those factors are also used by the State Supreme Court in evaluating the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s justifications for the sentence.  Pp.\xc2\xa09\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s arguments in support of its opposing view that \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d includes only \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d challenges to a conviction or sentence, and thus excludes motions for a discretionary sentence reduction, are unpersuasive.  Nor does \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d turn on whether a motion is part of the same criminal case.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).  The question in this case is whether a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law tolls the limitation period, thereby rendering respondent Khalil Kholi\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition timely.  We hold that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) means judicial review of a judgment in a proceeding that is not part of direct review.  Because the parties agree that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is not part of the direct review process, we hold that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s motion tolled the AEDPA limitation period and that his federal habeas petition was therefore timely.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 1993, respondent was convicted in Rhode Island Superior Court on 10 counts of first-degree sexual assault, and he was sentenced to consecutive terms of life im-prisonment.  Respondent raised various challenges to \nhis conviction on direct appeal, but the Supreme Court of Rhode Island affirmed his conviction.  See <em>State</em> v. <em>Kholi</em>, 672 A.\xc2\xa02d 429, 431 (1996).

The first, filed on May 16, 1996, was a motion to reduce sentence under Rule 35 of the Rhode Island Superior Court Rules of Criminal Procedure.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  App. 8.  In that motion, respondent asked the trial court to \xe2\x80\x9creconsider its prior determination\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9corder that his life sentences run concurrently.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v. <em>Kholi</em>, 706 A.\xc2\xa02d 1326 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 1998) (order).

App. 3.  By that time, his conviction had been final for over 11 years.  AEDPA generally requires a federal habeas petition to be filed within one year of the date on which the judgment became final by the conclusion of direct review.  28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d)(1)(A).  But the 1-year limitation period is tolled during the pendency of \xe2\x80\x9ca properly filed application for State post-conviction or other collateral review with respect to the pertinent judgment or claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no dispute that respondent\xe2\x80\x99s application for postconviction relief tolled the limitation period for over nine years\xe2\x80\x94from May 23, 1997, through December 14, 2006.  582 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 151.  Even after subtracting that stretch of time from the 11-year period, however, the period between the conclusion of direct review and the filing of the federal habeas petition still exceeds one year.  Thus, in order for respondent\xe2\x80\x99s petition to be timely, the Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence must also trigger the tolling provision.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s federal habeas petition was referred to a Magistrate Judge for a report and recommendation, and the Magistrate Judge concluded that the Rule 35 motion was not a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98properly filed application for post-conviction or other collateral review\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) because it was \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98plea of leniency,\xe2\x80\x99 and not a motion challenging the legal sufficiency of his sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  No. CA 07\xe2\x80\x93346S, 2008 WL 60194, *4 (R.\xc2\xa0I., Jan. 3, 2008).

Under the Rhode Island Rules, a Rule 35 motion permits a court to provide relief from a sentence in three ways: A court \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect an illegal sentence,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9ccorrect a sentence imposed in an illegal manner,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creduce any sentence.\xe2\x80\x9d  R.\xc2\xa0I.

Rhode Island courts have, at times, referred to such a motion as a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98plea for leniency.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruffner</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 867 (quoting <em>Mendoza</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1161).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A Rule 35 motion is made in the Superior Court, and it is generally heard by the same trial justice who sentenced the defendant. <em> Byrnes</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 745.  The Rhode Island Supreme Court has explained that a motion to reduce sentence is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98addressed to the sound discretion of the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that appellate review of the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s decision is limited.  <em>Ruffner</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 867 (quoting <em>Mendoza</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 1161).  An appellate court may nevertheless disturb the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s decision \xe2\x80\x9cwhen the trial justice has imposed a sentence that is without justification and is grossly disparate from other sentences generally imposed for similar offenses.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruffner</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 867<em> </em>(quoting <em>State </em>v. <em>Coleman</em>, 984 A.\xc2\xa02d 650, 654 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2009); internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Ruffner</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 867 (asking whether trial justice \xe2\x80\x9cabuse[d] his discretion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0With these principles in mind, we consider whether Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is an application for \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first\xe2\x80\x94and the critical\xe2\x80\x94question is whether a Rhode Island Rule 35 sentence reduction proceeding is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  Respondent and Rhode Island agree that such a motion is not part of the direct review process.  Moreover, we have previously referred to a motion to reduce sentence under old Rule 35 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure as invoking a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d remedy, see <em>Robinson, supra,</em> at 230, n.\xc2\xa014, and Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 35 motion to reduce sentence is \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially similar\xe2\x80\x9d to former Federal Rule 35, <em>Byrnes</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 744.  Lower courts have also referred to Federal Rule 35 sentence reduction motions as \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  See, <em>e.g., Fernandez </em>v. <em>United States</em>, 941 F.\xc2\xa02d 1488, 1492 (CA11 1991) (\xe2\x80\x9cFernandez initiated a collateral attack on his sentence with a Rule 35(b) motion to reduce his sentence\xe2\x80\x9d under the old Federal Rule).  We thus have little difficulty concluding that a Rhode Island sentence reduction proceeding is \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not only is a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral,\xe2\x80\x9d but it also undoubtedly calls for \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d of the sentence.  The decision to reduce a sentence, while largely within the discretion of the trial justice, involves judicial reexamination of the sentence to determine whether a more lenient sentence is proper.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  When ruling on such a motion, a trial justice is guided by several factors, including \xe2\x80\x9c(1) the severity of the crime, (2) the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s personal, educational, and employment background, (3) the potential for rehabilitation, (4) the element of societal deterrence, and (5) the appropriateness of the punishment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollicone</em>, 746 A. 2d 135, 138 (R. I. 2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Ruffner</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 867; <em>Coleman</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 655.  On appeal from a trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s decision on a motion to reduce sentence, the Supreme Court of Rhode Island evaluates the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s justifications in light of the relevant sentencing factors to determine whether a sentence is \xe2\x80\x9cwithout justification\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly disparate from other sentences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ruffner</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 867 (internal quotation marks omitted).[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  This process surely qualifies as \xe2\x80\x9creview\xe2\x80\x9d of a sentence within the meaning of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus hold that a motion to reduce sentence under Rhode Island law is an application for \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d that triggers AEDPA\xe2\x80\x99s tolling provision.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In resisting this interpretation, Rhode Island advances several arguments that we find unpersuasive.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The first of these arguments begins by observing that, whenever our opinions have used the precise phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d the proceeding in question was one challenging the \xe2\x80\x9clawfulness\xe2\x80\x9d of a prior judgment, Brief for Petitioner 21\xe2\x80\x9322, such as a \xc2\xa72254 or \xc2\xa72255 action, see <em>id.</em>, at 25.  Rhode Island argues that Congress, in enacting AEDPA, must be presumed to have been aware of this usage and must have intended the phrase to carry this narrow meaning.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument reads far too much into these prior references to \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d  While our opinions have used the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, we have never suggested that the phrase may properly be used to describe only proceedings of this type.  In addition, Rhode Island overlooks opinions describing a motion to reduce sentence as \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>E.g., Robinson</em>, 361 U. S., at 230, n.\xc2\xa014; <em>Fernandez</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 1492; see also 1 D. Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71:2, 1:7, pp. 2, 15 (2010) (characterizing a motion to reduce sentence as a \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpostconviction\xe2\x80\x9d remedy).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In a related argument, Rhode Island notes that several other AEDPA provisions use the term \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to proceedings that involve a challenge to the lawfulness of a state-court judgment, see 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72244(b)(2)(A),\xc2\xa0(d)(1)(C), 2254(e)(2)(A)(i),[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>] and Rhode Island reasons that the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) should be limited to proceedings of this nature.  This argument has the same flaw as the argument just discussed.  Just because the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses proceedings that challenge the lawfulness of a prior judgment, it does not follow that other proceedings may not also be described as involving \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Rhode Island contends that the purpose of the tolling provision is to allow a state prisoner to exhaust state remedies and that this purpose is not served when a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s state application merely seeks sentencing leniency, a matter that cannot be raised in a federal habeas petition.  This argument is based on an excessively narrow understanding of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s role.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is certainly true that <em>a </em>purpose\xe2\x80\x94and perhaps the chief purpose\xe2\x80\x94of tolling under \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) is to permit \nthe exhaustion of state remedies, see <em>Duncan</em>, 533 U. S., at 178\xe2\x80\x93179, but that is not \xc2\xa72244(d)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s only role.  The tolling provision \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a powerful incentive for litigants to exhaust <em>all</em> available state remedies before proceeding in the lower federal courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 180 (emphasis added).  Tolling the limitation period for all \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d motions provides both litigants and States with an opportunity to resolve objections at the state level, potentially obviating the need for a litigant to resort to federal court.  If, for example, a litigant obtains relief on state-law grounds, there may be no need for federal habeas.  The same dynamic may be present to a degree with respect to motions that do not challenge the lawfulness of a judgment.  If a defendant receives relief in state court, the need for federal habeas review may be narrowed or even obviated, and this furthers principles of \xe2\x80\x9ccomity, finality, and federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, 529 U. S., at 436.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) would also greatly complicate the work of federal habeas courts.  Rhode Island would require those courts to separate motions for a reduced sentence into two categories: those that challenge a sentence on legal grounds and those that merely ask for leniency.  But this taxonomy is problematic.  Even if a jurisdiction allows sentencing judges to exercise a high degree of discretion in selecting a sentence from within a prescribed range, it does not necessarily follow that the judge\xe2\x80\x99s choice is insulated from challenge on legal grounds.  \xe2\x80\x9c[D]iscretionary choices are not left to a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98inclination, but to its judgment; and its judgment is to be guided by sound legal principles.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U. S. 405</a>, 416 (1975) (quoting <em>United States </em>v. <em>Burr</em>, 25 F.\xc2\xa0Cas. 30, 35 (No.\xc2\xa014,692d) (CC Va. 1807) (Marshall, C.\xc2\xa0J.)).  If the law of a jurisdiction provides criteria to guide a trial judge\xe2\x80\x99s exercise of sentencing discretion, a motion to reduce sentence may argue that a sentence is inconsistent with those criteria.  In that sense, the motion argues that the sentence is contrary to sentencing law.  See, <em>e.g., Ruffner</em>, 5 A.\xc2\xa03d<em>,</em> at 867 (\xe2\x80\x9cA trial justice considers a number of factors when determining a fair sentence[,] including the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s potential for rehabilitation.  The defendant asserts that the trial justice did not consider defendant\xe2\x80\x99s participation in rehabilitative programs\xe2\x80\x9d (citations omitted)).  We do not think that \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) was meant to require federal habeas courts to draw the sort of difficult distinction that Rhode Island\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation would demand.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We also reject the argument that the meaning of the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d should turn on whether the motion or application that triggers that review is captioned as a part of the criminal case or as a separate proceeding.  See <em>Walkowiak </em>v. <em>Haines</em>, 272 F.\xc2\xa03d 234, 237 (CA4 2001).  This interpretation of \xc2\xa72244(d)(2) would produce confusion and inconsistency.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For one thing, some \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral\xe2\x80\x9d proceedings are often regarded as part of the criminal case.  We have said, for example, that a writ of <em>coram nobis </em>\xe2\x80\x9cis a step in the criminal case and not \xe2\x80\xa6 a separate case and record, the beginning of a separate civil proceeding.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan</em>, 346 U. S., at 505, n.\xc2\xa04; see also <em>United States </em>v. <em>Denedo</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (slip op., at 8) (\xe2\x80\x9c[A]n application for the writ is properly viewed as a belated extension of the original proceeding during which the error allegedly transpired\xe2\x80\x9d).  But we have nonetheless suggested that <em>coram nobis </em>is a means of \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral attack.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 510\xe2\x80\x93511 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also <em>Robinson</em>, 361 U. S., at 230, n.\xc2\xa014.  Similarly, a motion under 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72255 (2006 ed., Supp. III) is entered on the docket of the original criminal case and is typically referred to the judge who originally presided over the challenged proceedings, see \xc2\xa72255 Rules 3(b), 4(a), but there is no dispute that \xc2\xa72255 proceedings are \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral,\xe2\x80\x9d see, <em>e.g., Massaro</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/538/500/index.html">538 U.

In the District of Columbia and fourteen States, the principal postconviction remedy is part of the original case; in other States, it is not.  1 Wilkes, State Postconviction Remedies and Relief Handbook \xc2\xa71:3, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  Given the States\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cdifferent forms of collateral review,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Duncan</em>, 533 U.

See <em>ibid.</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cCongress may have refrained from exclusive reliance on the term \xe2\x80\x98post-conviction\xe2\x80\x99 so as to leave no doubt that the tolling provision applies \nto all types of state collateral review available after a conviction\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We thus define \xe2\x80\x9ccollateral review\xe2\x80\x9d according to its ordinary meaning: It refers to judicial review that occurs in a proceeding outside of the direct review process.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Court of Appeals is affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left">It is so ordered.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0This Rule provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9cThe court may correct an illegal sentence at any time.

Even if we were to assume that a Rhode Island Rule 35 motion is part of direct review, our disposition of this case would not change: Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s habeas petition still would be timely, because the limitation period would not have begun to run until after the Rule 35 proceedings concluded.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0A motion to reduce sentence is unlike a motion for postconviction discovery or a motion for appointment of counsel, which generally are not direct requests for judicial review of a judgment and do not provide a state court with authority to order relief from a judgment.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0<em>E.g., State </em>v. <em>Coleman</em>,<em> </em>984 A.\xc2\xa02d 650, 657 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2009) (\xe2\x80\x9cGiven these factors, and the trial justice\xe2\x80\x99s exhaustive explanation of her reasoning in sentencing Mr. Coleman, we hold it was not an abuse of her discretion to order Mr. Coleman to serve consecutive sentences\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Ferrara</em>, 818 A.\xc2\xa02d 642, 645 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2003) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9c[M]itigating circumstances clearly are not present in this case\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>State </em>v. <em>Rossi</em>, 771 A.\xc2\xa02d 906, 908 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2001) (order) (\xe2\x80\x9cBased upon [the court\xe2\x80\x99s] review of the record,\xe2\x80\x9d the sentence \xe2\x80\x9cwas not excessive and was justified under the circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9cthe abhorrent conduct of [the] defendant\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe permissible penalty range\xe2\x80\x9d under the statute); <em>State </em>v. <em>Mollicone</em>, 746 A.\xc2\xa02d 135, 138 (R.\xc2\xa0I. 2000) <em>(per curiam) </em>(\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he trial justice was aware of these factors and applied them correctly\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0All of these provisions refer to a new rule of constitutional law made retroactively applicable by this Court to \xe2\x80\x9ccases on collateral review.\xe2\x80\x9d    </p>\n<a href="#T7" name="F7">Footnote 7</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0In other contexts not relevant here, there has been some confusion over whether \xc2\xa72255 proceedings are civil or criminal in nature.
