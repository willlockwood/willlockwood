In that judgment, the court unanimously upheld the constitutionality of the textbook loan program authorized by Act 195.  374 F.Supp. at 657-658.  By a divided vote, the court also upheld the constitutionality of Act 194\'s provision of auxiliary services to children in nonpublic elementary and secondary schools and Act 195\'s authorization of loans of instructional materials directly to nonpublic elementary and secondary schools.  374 F.Supp. at 653-659.  The court unanimously invalidated that portion of Act 195 authorizing the expenditure of commonwealth funds for the purchase of instructional equipment for loan to nonpublic schools, but only to the extent that the provision allowed the loan of equipment "which, from its nature, can be diverted to religious purposes."  374 F.Supp. at 662.  The court gave as examples projection and recording equipment.  <em>Id.</em> at 660-661.  By a vote of 2-1, the court upheld this provision of Act 195 insofar as it authorizes the loan of instructional equipment that cannot be readily diverted to religious uses.  374 F.Supp. at 660-661.</p>\n<p>Except with respect to that provision of Act 195 which permits loan of instructional equipment capable of diversion, therefore, the plaintiffs\' request for preliminary and final injunctive relief was denied.

S. 358</a></p><p></p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>In judging the constitutionality of the various forms of assistance authorized by Acts 194 and 195, the District Court applied the three-part test that has been clearly stated, if not easily applied, by this Court in recent Establishment Clause cases.  <em>See, e.g., Committee for Public Education  Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html">413 U. S. 756</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html#772">413 U. S. 772</a></span>-773; <em>Lemon v.

First, the statute must have a secular legislative purpose.  <em>E.g., Epperson v. Arkansas,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/393/97/case.html">393 U. S. 97</a></span>.  Second, it must have a "primary effect" that neither advances nor inhibits religion.  <em>E.g., School District of Abington Township v. Schempp,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/374/203/case.html">374 U. S. 203</a></span>.  Third, the statute and its administration must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.  <em>E.g., Walz v. Tax Comm\'n,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/397/664/case.html">397 U. S. 664</a></span>.</p>\n<p>These tests constitute a convenient, accurate distillation of this Court\'s efforts over the past decades to evaluate a wide range of governmental action challenged as violative of the constitutional prohibition against laws "respecting an establishment of religion," and thus provide the proper framework of analysis for the issues presented in the case before us.  It is well to emphasize, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="359">Page 421 U. S. 359</a></p><p> however, that the tests must not be viewed as setting the precise limits to the necessary constitutional inquiry, but serve only as guidelines with which to identify instances in which the objectives of the Establishment Clause have been impaired.  <em>See Tilton v. Richardson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html">403 U. S. 672</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/672/case.html#677">403 U.

The Court has broadly stated that</p>\n<p>"[n]o tax in any amount, large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they may adopt to teach or practice religion."</p>\n<p><em>Everson v.

But it is clear that not all legislative programs that provide indirect or incidental benefit to a religious institution are prohibited by the Constitution.  <em>See Zorach v.

Similarly, the Court in <em>Allen</em> found that the New York textbook law</p>\n<p>"merely makes available to all children the benefits of a general program to lend school books free of charge.

S. 361</a></p><p> As in <em>Allen,</em> Act 195 provides that the textbooks are to be lent directly to the student, not to the nonpublic school itself, although, again as in <em>Allen,</em> the administrative practice is to have student requests for the books filed initially with the nonpublic school and to have the school authorities prepare collective summaries of these requests which they forward to the appropriate public officials.  <em>See Board of Education v. Allen, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/236/case.html#244">392 U. S. 244</a></span> n. 6. [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  Thus, the financial benefit of Pennsylvania\'s textbook program, like New York\'s, is to parents and children, not to the nonpublic schools. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>Under New York law, the books that could be lent were limited to textbooks</p>\n<p>"which are designated for use in any public, elementary or secondary schools of the state or are approved by any boards of education, trustees or other school authorities."</p>\n<p>N.Y.Educ.Law \xc2\xa7 701(3).  The law was construed by the New York Court of Appeals to apply solely to secular textbook.  <em>Board of Education v. Allen,</em> 20 N.Y.2d 109, 117, 228 N.E.2d 791, 794.Act 195 similarly limits the books that may be lent to "textbooks which are acceptable for use in any public, elementary, or secondary school of the Commonwealth." [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>]  Moreover, the record in the case </p><p><a class="page-number" name="362">Page 421 U.

As such, those provisions of Act 195 do not offend the constitutional prohibition against laws "respecting an establishment of religion." [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>IV</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although textbooks are lent only to students, Act 195 authorizes the loan of instructional material and equipment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="363">Page 421 U. S. 363</a></p><p> directly to qualifying nonpublic elementary and secondary schools in the Commonwealth.  The appellants assert that such direct aid to Pennsylvania\'s nonpublic schools, including church-related institutions, constitutes an impermissible establishment of religion.</p>\n<p>Act 195 is accompanied by legislative findings that the welfare of the Commonwealth requires that present and future generations of schoolchildren be assured ample opportunity to develop their intellectual capacities.</p>\n<p>Act 195 is intended to further that objective by extending the benefits of free educational aids to every schoolchild in the Commonwealth, including nonpublic school students, who constitute approximately one quarter of the schoolchildren in Pennsylvania.  Act 185, \xc2\xa7 1(a), Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7 9-972(a).  We accept the legitimacy of this secular legislative purpose.  <em>Cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#609">403 U.

S. 829</a></span>-830.  But we agree with the appellants that the direct loan of instructional material and equipment has the unconstitutional primary effect of advancing religion because of the predominantly religious character of the schools benefiting from the Act. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p>The only requirement imposed on nonpublic schools to qualify for loans of instructional material and equipment is that they satisfy the Commonwealth\'s compulsory attendance law by providing, in the English language, the subjects and activities prescribed by the standards of the State Board of Education.  Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7 13-1327.  Commonwealth officials, as a matter of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="364">Page 421 U. S. 364</a></p><p> state policy, do not inquire into the religious characteristics, if any, of the nonpublic schools requesting aid pursuant to Act 195.  The Coordinator of Nonpublic School Services, the chief administrator of Acts 194 and 195, testified that a school would not be barred from receiving loans of instructional material and equipment even though its dominant purpose was the inculcation of religious values, even if it imposed religious restrictions on admissions or on faculty appointments, and even if it required attendance at classes in theology or at religious services.  In fact, of the 1,320 nonpublic schools in Pennsylvania that comply with the requirements of the compulsory attendance law, and thus qualify for aid under Act 195, more than 75% are church-related or religiously affiliated educational institutions.  Thus, the primary beneficiaries of Act 195\'s instructional material and equipment loan provisions, like the beneficiaries of the "secular educational services" reimbursement program considered in <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> and the parent tuition reimbursement plan considered in <em>Sloan v. Lemon,</em> are nonpublic schools with a predominant sectarian character. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]</p>\n<p>It is, of course, true that, as part of general legislation made available to all students, a State may include church-related schools in programs providing bus transportation, school lunches, and public health facilities -- secular and non-ideological services unrelated to the primary, religion-oriented educational function of the sectarian school.  The indirect and incidental benefits to church-related schools from those programs do not offend the constitutional prohibition against establishment </p><p><a class="page-number" name="365">Page 421 U. S. 365</a></p><p> of religion.  <em>See, e.g., Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>; <em>Lemon v.

But the massive aid provided the church-related nonpublic schools of Pennsylvania by Act 195 is neither indirect nor incidental.</p>\n<p>For the 1972-1973 school year, the Commonwealth authorized just under $12 million of direct aid to the predominantly church-related nonpublic schools of Pennsylvania through the loan of instructional material and equipment pursuant to Act 195. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]  To be sure, the material and equipment that are the subjects of the loan -- maps, charts, and laboratory equipment, for example -- are "self-polic[ing], in that, starting as secular, nonideological and neutral, they will not change in use."  374 F.Supp. at 660.  But faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by Act 195, it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania\'s church-related elementary and secondary schools, and to then characterize Act 195 as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.  Even </p><p><a class="page-number" name="366">Page 421 U. S. 366</a></p><p> though earmarked for secular purposes,</p>\n<p>"when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission,"</p>\n<p>state aid has the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion.  <em>Hunt v. McNair,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/734/case.html">413 U.

S. 743</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The church-related elementary and secondary schools that are the primary beneficiaries of Act 195\'s instructional material and equipment loans typify such religion-pervasive institutions.  The very purpose of many of those schools is to provide an integrated secular and religious education; the teaching process is, to a large extent, devoted to the inculcation of religious values and belief.  <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#616">403 U. S. 616</a></span>-617.  Substantial aid to the educational function of such schools, accordingly, necessarily results in aid to the sectarian school enterprise as a whole.</p>\n<p>[T]he secular education those schools provide goes hand in hand with the religious mission that is the only reason for the schools\' existence.  Within the institution, the two are inextricably intertwined.</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#657">403 U.

For this reason, Act 195\'s direct aid to Pennsylvania\'s predominantly church-related, nonpublic elementary and secondary schools, even though ostensibly limited to wholly neutral, secular instructional material and equipment, inescapably results in the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity, <em>cf.

The "auxiliary services" authorized by Act 194 -- remedial and accelerated instruction, guidance counseling and testing, speech and hearing services -- are provided directly to nonpublic school children with the appropriate special need.  But the services are provided only on the nonpublic school premises, and only when "requested by nonpublic school representatives."  Department of Education, Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, Guidelines for the Administration of Acts 194 and 195, \xc2\xa7 1.3.</p>\n<p>The legislative findings accompanying Act 194 are virtually identical to those in Act 195:  Act 194 is intended to assure full development of the intellectual capacities of the children of Pennsylvania by extending the benefits </p><p><a class="page-number" name="368">Page 421 U. S. 368</a></p><p> of free auxiliary services to all students in the Commonwealth.  Act 194, 1(a), Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7 9972(a).  The appellants concede the validity of this secular legislative purpose.  Nonetheless, they argue that Act 194 constitutes an impermissible establishment of religion because the auxiliary services are provided on the premises of predominantly church-related schools. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In rejecting the appellants\' argument, the District Court emphasized that "auxiliary services" are provided directly to the children involved, and are expressly limited to those services which are secular, neutral, and nonideological.  The court also noted that the instruction and counseling in question served only to supplement the basic, normal educational offerings of the qualifying nonpublic schools.  Any benefits to church-related schools that may result from the provision of such services, the District Court concluded, are merely incidental and indirect, and thus not impermissible.  <em>See</em> 374 F.Supp. at 656-657.  The court also held that no continuing supervision of the personnel providing auxiliary services would be necessary to establish that Act 194\'s secular limitations were observed or to guarantee that a member of the auxiliary services staff had not "succumb[ed] to sectarianization of his or her professional work."  374 F.Supp. at 657. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="369">Page 421 U. S. 369</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We need not decide whether substantial State expenditures to enrich the curricula of church-related elementary and secondary schools, [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>] like the expenditure of state funds to support the basic educational program of those schools, necessarily result in the direct and substantial advancement of religious activity. [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]  For decisions of this Court make clear that the District Court erred in relying entirely on the good faith and professionalism of the secular teachers and counselors functioning in church-related schools to ensure that a strictly nonideological posture is maintained.</p>\n<p>In <em>Earley v. DiCenso,</em> a companion case to <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra,</em> the Court invalidated a Rhode Island statute authorizing salary supplements for teacher of secular subjects in nonpublic schools.  The Court expressly rejected the proposition, relied upon by the District Court in the case before us, that it was sufficient for the State to assume that teachers in church-related schools would succeed in segregating their religious beliefs from their secular educational duties.</p>\n<p>"We need not and do not assume that teachers in parochial schools will be guilty of bad faith or any conscious design to evade the limitations imposed by the statute and the First Amendment. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  But the potential for impermissible fostering of religion is present.  The State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion. . . . "</p><p><a class="page-number" name="370">Page 421 U.

S. 619</a></span>.  The same excessive entanglement would be required for Pennsylvania to be "certain," as it must be, that Act 194 personnel do not advance the religious mission of the church-related schools in which they serve.  <em>Public Funds for Public Schools v. Marburger,</em> 358 F.Supp. 29, 40-41, <em>aff\'d,</em> 417 U.S. 961. [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]</p>\n<p>That Act 194 authorizes state funding of teachers only for remedial and exceptional students, and not for normal students participating in the core curriculum, does not distinguish this case from <em>Earley v. DiCenso</em> and <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra.</em> Whether the subject is "remedial reading," "advanced reading," or simply "reading," a teacher remains a teacher, and the danger that religious doctrine will become intertwined with secular instruction persists.  The likelihood of inadvertent fostering of religion </p><p><a class="page-number" name="371">Page 421 U. S. 371</a></p><p> may be less in a remedial arithmetic class than in a medieval history seminar, but a diminished probability of impermissible conduct is not sufficient:   "The State must be certain, given the Religion Clauses, that subsidized teachers do not inculcate religion."  403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#619">403 U. S. 619</a></span>.  And a state-subsidized guidance counselor is surely as likely as a state-subsidized chemistry teacher to fail on occasion to separate religious instruction and the advancement of religious beliefs from his secular educational responsibilities. [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]</p>\n<p>The fact that the teachers and counselors providing auxiliary services are employees of the public intermediate unit, rather than of the church-related schools in which they work, does not substantially eliminate the need for continuing surveillance.  To be sure, auxiliary services personnel, because not employed by the nonpublic schools, are not directly subject to the discipline of a religious authority.  <em>Cf. Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#618">403 U. S. 618</a></span>.  But they are performing important educational services in schools in which education is an integral part of the dominant sectarian mission and in which an atmosphere dedicated to the advancement of religious belief is constantly maintained.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#618">403 U. S. 618</a></span>-619.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="372">Page 421 U. S. 372</a></p><p> The potential for impermissible fostering of religion under these circumstances, although somewhat reduced, is nonetheless present.  To be certain that auxiliary teachers remain religiously neutral, as the Constitution demands, the State would have to impose limitations on the activities of auxiliary personnel and then engage in some form of continuing surveillance to ensure that those restrictions were being followed. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]</p>\n<p>In addition, Act 194, like the statutes considered in <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra,</em> and <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, supra,</em> creates a serious potential for divisive conflict over the issue of aid to religion -- "entanglement in the broader sense of continuing political strife."  <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v.

The recurrent nature of the appropriation process guarantees annual reconsideration of Act 194 and the prospect of repeated confrontation between proponents and opponents of the auxiliary services program.  The Act thus provides successive opportunities for political fragmentation and division along religious lines, one of the principal evils against which the Establishment Clause was intended to protect.  <em>See Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#622">403 U. S. 622</a></span>-623.  This potential for political entanglement, together with the administrative entanglement which would be necessary to ensure that auxiliary services personnel remain strictly neutral and nonideological when functioning in church-related schools, compels the conclusion that Act 194 violates the constitutional prohibition against laws "respecting an establishment of religion." </p><p><a class="page-number" name="373">Page 421 U.

S. </a></span></p>\n<p>A three-factor test by which to determine the compatibility with the Establishment Clause of state subsidies of sectarian educational institutions has evolved over 50 years of this Court\'s stewardship in the field.  The law in question must, first, reflect a clearly secular legislative purpose; second, have a primary effect [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] that neither </p><p><a class="page-number" name="374">Page 421 U. S. 374</a></p><p> advances nor inhibits religion; and, third, avoid excessive government entanglement with religion.  But four years ago, the Court, albeit without express recognition of the fact, added a significant fourth factor to the test:  "A broader base of entanglement of yet a different character is presented by the divisive political potential of these state programs."  <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html">403 U. S. 602</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#622">403 U. S. 622</a></span> (1971).  The evaluation of this factor in determining compatibility of a state subsidy law with the Establishment Clause is essential, said the Court, because:</p>\n<p>"In a community where . . . a large number of pupils are served by church-related schools, it can be assumed that state assistance will entail considerable political activity.  Partisans of parochial schools, understandably concerned with rising costs and sincerely dedicated to both the religious and secular educational missions of their schools, will inevitably champion this cause and promote political action to achieve their goals.  Those who oppose state aid, whether for constitutional, religious, or fiscal reasons, will inevitably respond and employ all of the usual political campaign techniques to prevail.  Candidates will be forced to declare, and voters to choose.  It would be unrealistic to ignore the fact that many people confronted with issues of this kind will find their votes aligned with their faith."</p>\n<p>"Ordinarily political debate and division, however vigorous or even partisan, are normal and healthy manifestations of our democratic system of government, <em>but political division along religious lines was one of the principal evils against which the First Amendment was intended to protect.</em> . . .  The potential divisiveness of such conflict is a threat to the normal political process. . . .  It conflicts with our whole history and tradition to permit questions of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="375">Page 421 U. S. 375</a></p><p> the Religion Clauses to assume such importance in our legislatures and in our elections that they could divert attention from the myriad issues and problems that confront every level of government. . . ."</p>\n<p>". . .  <em>Here we are confronted with successive and very likely permanent annual appropriations that benefit relatively few religious groups.  Political fragmentation and divisiveness on religious lines are thus likely to be intensified.</em>"</p>\n<p>"<em>The potential for political divisiveness related to religious belief and practice is aggravated . . . by the need for continuing annual appropriations and the likelihood of larger and larger demands as costs and populations row. . . .</em>"</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 62623. (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p>This factor was key in <em>Kurtzman\'s</em> determination that Pennsylvania and Rhode Island statutes providing state aid to church-related elementary and secondary schools violated the Establishment Clause.  The Pennsylvania statute provided financial support by way of reimbursement for the cost of teachers\' salaries, textbooks, and instructional materials in specified secular subjects.  The Rhode Island statute provided a program under which the State paid directly to teachers in nonpublic schools a supplement of 15% of their annual salary.</p>\n<p><em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html">413 U. S. 756</a></span> (1973), decided two years later, emphasized the importance to be attached by judges to this fourth factor:  "One factor of recurring significance in this weighing process is the potentially divisive political effect of an aid program."  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html#795">413 U. S. 795</a></span>.

The recurrent nature of the appropriation process guarantees annual reconsideration of Act 194 and the prospect of repeated confrontation between proponents and opponents of the auxiliary services program.  The Act thus provides successive opportunities for political fragmentation and division along religious lines, one of the principal evils against which the Establishment Clause was intended to protect."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#372">421 U.

S. 366</a></span>.</p>\n<p>I recognize that the plurality was on the horns of a dilemma.  The plurality notes that the total 1972-1973 appropriation under Act 195 was $16,660,000, of which $4,670,000 was appropriated to finance the textbook program.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#365">421 U. S. 365</a></span> n. 15.  The plurality notes further that</p>\n<p>"aid programs like Act 195 . . . are dependent on continuing annual appropriations . . . which generate increasing demands as costs and population grow . . . ,"</p>\n<p><em>ibid.,</em> and, indeed, that the total Act 195 appropriation was increased $900,000 to $17,560,000 for the 1973-1974 school year.  Plainly then, as in <em>Nyquist,</em> the political divisiveness factor applies "with peculiar force to the. . . statute now before us."  But to comply with <em>Nyquist,</em> as is required, the plurality obviously must attach determinative weight to the factor as respects both the textbook loan and instructional materials and equipment loan provisions, since both are inextricably intertwined in Act 195. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  For, in light of the massive appropriations involved, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="378">Page 421 U. S. 378</a></p><p> the plurality would be hard-put to explain how the factor weighs determinatively against the validity of the instructional materials loan provisions, and not also against the validity of the textbook loan provisions.  The plurality therefore would extricate itself from the horns of the dilemma by simply ignoring the factor in the weighing process.</p>\n<p>But however much this evasion may be tolerable in the case of the instructional materials loan provisions, since these are invalidated on other grounds, responsibility for evaluating the weight to be accorded the factor cannot be evaded, in the case of the textbook loan provisions, by relying, as the plurality does, upon its agreement with the District Court that the textbook loan program is indistinguishable from the New York textbook loan program upheld in <em>Board of Education v. Allen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/236/case.html">392 U. S. 236</a></span> (1968).  For <em>Allen,</em> which I joined, was decided before <em>Kurtzman</em> ordained that the political divisiveness factor must be involved in the weighing process, and understandably neither the parties to <em>Allen</em> nor the Court addressed that factor in that case.  But whether or not <em>Allen</em> can withstand overruling in light of <em>Kurtzman</em> and <em>Nyquist,</em> which I question, it is clear that <em>Kurtzman</em> -- which, I repeat, applied the factor to a Pennsylvania program that included reimbursement for the cost of textbooks -- requires that the plurality weigh the factor in the instant case.  Further, giving the factor the weight that <em>Kurtzman</em> and <em>Nyquist</em> require, compels, in my view, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="379">Page 421 U. S. 379</a></p><p> the conclusion that the textbook loan program of Act 195, equally with the program for loan of instructional materials and equipment, violates the Establishment Clause.  The plurality\'s answer is that a difference in result is justified because Act 195 distinguishes between recipients of the loans:  textbooks are lent to students, while instructional material and equipment are lent directly to the schools.  That answer will not withstand analysis.</p>\n<p>First, it is pure fantasy to treat the textbook program as a loan to students.  It is true that, like the New York statute in <em>Allen,</em> Act 195, in terms, talks of loans by the State of acceptable secular textbooks directly to students attending nonpublic schools.  But even the plurality acknowledges that "the administrative practice is to have student requests for the books filed initially with the nonpublic school, and to have the school authorities prepare collective summaries of these requests which they forward to the appropriate public officials. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#361">421 U.

Further, "the nonpublic schools are permitted to store on their premises the textbooks being lent to the students."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#361">421 U. S. 361</a></span> n. 9.  Even if these practices were also followed under the New York statute, the regulations implementing Act 195 make clear, as the record in <em>Allen</em> did not, that the nonpublic school in Pennsylvania is something more than a conduit between the State and pupil.  The Commonwealth has promulgated "Guidelines for the Administration of Acts 194 and 195" to implement the statutes.  These regulations, unlike those upheld in <em>Allen,</em> constitute a much more intrusive and detailed involvement of the State and its processes into the administration of nonpublic schools.  The whole business is handled by the schools and public authorities, and neither parents nor students have a say.  The guidelines make crystal clear that the nonpublic school, not its pupils, is the motivating force behind the textbook </p><p><a class="page-number" name="380">Page 421 U. S. 380</a></p><p> loan, and that virtually the entire loan transaction is to be, and is, in fact, conducted between officials of the nonpublic school, on the one hand, and officers of the State, on the other.</p>\n<p>For example, \xc2\xa7 4.3 of the Guidelines requires that, on or before March 1 of each year, an official of each nonpublic school submit to the Pennsylvania Department of Education a loan request for the desired textbooks.  The requests must be submitted on standardized forms "distributed by the Department of Education . . . to each nonpublic school or the appropriate chief administrator."  Section 4.6 of the Guidelines provides that the "[t]extbooks requested will be shipped directly to the appropriate nonpublic school."  Thus, although, in terms, the form provided by the Commonwealth for parents of nonpublic school students states that the parents of these pupils request the loan of textbooks directly from the State, the form is not returnable to the State, but to the nonpublic school, which tabulates the requests and submits its total to the State.  Then, after the submission by the nonpublic school is approved by the appropriate state official, the books are transported not to the children whose parents ostensibly made the request, but directly to the nonpublic school, where they are physically retained when not in use in the classroom.</p>\n<p>Indeed, the Guidelines make no attempt to mask the true nature of the loan transaction.  In explicit words, \xc2\xa7 4.10 describes the transaction:  "Textbooks <em>loaned to the nonpublic schools:</em>  (a) shall be maintained on an inventory by the nonpublic school."  (Emphasis added.)  Section 4.11 provides:</p>\n<p>"It is presumed that textbooks on <em>loan to nonpublic schools,</em> after a period of time, will be lost, missing, obsolete or worn out.  This information should be communicated to the Department of Education.  After a period of six years, textbooks shall be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 421 U. S. 381</a></p><p> declared unserviceable and the disposal of such shall be at the discretion of the Secretary of Education."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  Thus, the loan of the textbooks is treated by the regulations as what it, in fact, is:  a loan from the State directly to the nonpublic school.  Finally, \xc2\xa7 4.12 completely removes any possible doubt.  It provides:</p>\n<p>"The nonpublic school or the agency which it is a member shall be responsible for maintaining on file certificates of requests from parents of children for all textbook materials loaned to them under this act.  The file must be open to inspection by the appropriate authority.  A letter certifying the certificates on file shall accompany all loan requests."</p>\n<p>Plainly, then, whatever may have been the case under the New York statute sustained in <em>Allen,</em> the loan ostensibly to students is, under Act 195, a loan, in fact, to the schools.  In this regard, it should be observed that sophisticated attempts to avoid the Constitution are just as invalid as simple-minded ones.  <em>Lane v. Wilson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/268/case.html">307 U. S. 268</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/268/case.html#275">307 U. S. 275</a></span> (1939).</p>\n<p>Second, in any event, <em>Allen</em> itself made clear that, far from providing a <em>per se</em> immunity from examination of the substance of the State\'s program, even if the fact were, and it is not, that textbooks are loaned to the children, rather than to the schools, that is only one among the factors to be weighed in determining the compatibility of the program with the Establishment Clause.  <em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,</em> 413 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html#781">413 U. S. 781</a></span>.  And, clearly, in the context of application of the factor of political divisiveness, it is wholly irrelevant whether the loan is to the children or to the school.  A divisive political potential exists because aid programs, like Act 195, are dependent on continuing </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 421 U. S. 382</a></p><p> annual appropriations, and Act 195\'s textbook loan program, even if we accepted it as a form of loans to students, involves increasingly massive sums now approaching $5,000,000 annually. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  It would blind reality to treat massive aid to nonpublic schools, under the guise of loans to the students, as not creating "a serious potential for divisive conflict over the issue of aid to religion."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#372">421 U. S. 372</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>]  The focus of the textbook loan program in terms of massive financial support for religious schools that creates the potential divisiveness is no less real than it is in the case of Act 195\'s instructional materials provisions and Act 194\'s invalidated program for auxiliary services.  Act 195 is intended solely as a financial aid program to relieve the desperate financial plight of nonpublic, primarily parochial, schools.  The plurality suggests that it is immaterial that Act 195 has that cast, in contrast with New York\'s statute in <em>Allen,</em> which authorized loans to students attending both public and nonpublic schools.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#360">421 U. S. 360</a></span> n. 8.  On the contrary, Act 195\'s limitation of its financial support to aid to nonpublic school children exacerbates the potential for political divisiveness. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 421 U. S. 383</a></p><p></p>\n<p>"In this situation, where the underlying issue is the deeply emotional one of Church-State relationships, the potential for seriously divisive political consequences needs no elaboration."</p>\n<p><em>Committee for Public Education &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html#797">413 U. S. 797</a></span>.</p>\n<p>Finally, the textbook loan provisions of Act 195, even if ostensibly limiting loans to nonpublic school children, violate the Establishment Clause for reasons independent of the political divisiveness factor.  As I have said, unlike the New York statute in <em>Allen,</em> which extended assistance to all students, whether attending public or nonpublic schools, Act 195 extends textbook assistance only to a special class of students, children who attend nonpublic schools which are, as the plurality notes, primarily religiously oriented.  The Act in that respect contains the same fatal defect as the New Jersey statute held violative of the Establishment Clause in <em>Public Funds for Public Schools v. Marburger,</em> 358 F.Supp. 29 (NJ 1973), <em>aff\'d,</em> 417 U.S. 961 (1974).  The statute there involved was N.J.Stat.Ann. \xc2\xa7 18A:58-63 which furnished state aid, in amounts up to $10 for elementary school students and up to $20 for high school students, to the parents of nonpublic school students as reimbursement for the cost of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 421 U. S. 384</a></p><p> "secular, nonideological textbooks, instructional materials and supplies."  We affirmed the holding of the three-judge court that,</p>\n<p>"because the language of [the statute] limits the assistance provided therein only to parents of children who attend nonpublic, predominately religiously affiliated schools, and not to parents of all school children, we are satisfied that its primary effect is to advance religion, and that it is thereby unconstitutional."</p>\n<p>358 F.Supp. at 36.  <em>Marburger</em> thus establishes that the plurality\'s reliance today upon <em>Allen</em> is clearly misplaced.</p>\n<p>Indeed, that reliance is also misplaced in light of its own holding today invalidating the provisions of Act 195 respecting the loan of instructional materials and equipment.  I have no doubt that such materials and equipment are tools that substantially enhance the quality of the secular education provided by the religiously oriented schools.  But surely the heart tools of that education are the textbooks that are prescribed for use and kept at the schools, albeit formally at the request of the students.  Thus, what the Court says of the instructional materials and equipment, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#365">421 U. S. 365</a></span>-366, may be said perhaps even more accurately of the textbooks:</p>\n<p>"But faced with the substantial amounts of direct support authorized by Act 195, it would simply ignore reality to attempt to separate secular educational functions from the predominantly religious role performed by many of Pennsylvania\'s church-related elementary and secondary schools, and to then characterize Act 195 as channeling aid to the secular without providing direct aid to the sectarian.  Even though earmarked for secular purposes, \'when it flows to an institution in which religion is so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed in the religious mission,\' state aid has the impermissible primary effect of advancing religion."</p>\n<p>In sum, I join the Court\'s opinion as to Parts I, II, IV, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 421 U. S. 385</a></p><p> and V, except that I would go further in Part IV and rest the invalidation of the provisions of Act 195 for loans of instructional materials and equipment also upon the political divisiveness factor.

Indeed, it is precisely the function of [Act 195] to provide assistance to private schools, the great majority of which are sectarian.  By [relieving parents of their textbook bill], the State seeks to relieve their financial burdens sufficiently to assure that they continue to have the option to send their children to religion-oriented schools.

CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER, concurring in the judgment in part and dissenting in part.</p>\n<p>I agree with the Court only insofar as it affirms the judgment of the District Court.  My limited agreement with the Court as to this action leads me, however, to agree generally with the views expressed by MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST and MR. JUSTICE WHITE in regard to the other programs under review.  I especially find it difficult to accept the Court\'s extravagant suggestion of potential entanglement which it finds in the "auxiliary services" program of Act 194.  Here, the Court\'s holding, it seems to me, goes beyond any prior holdings of this Court and, indeed, conflicts with our holdings in <em>Board of Education v. Allen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/236/case.html">392 U. S. 236</a></span> (1968), and <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html">403 U. S. 602</a></span> (1971).  There is absolutely no support in this record or, for that matter, in ordinary human experience, for the concern some see with respect to the "dangers" lurking in extending common, nonsectarian tools of the education process -- especially remedial tools to students in private schools.  As I noted in my separate opinion in <em>Committee for Public Education  Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html">413 U. S. 756</a></span> (1973), the</p>\n<p>"fundamental principle which I see running through our prior decisions in this difficult and sensitive field of law . . . is premised more on experience and history than on logic."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/413/756/case.html#802">413 U. S. 802</a></span>.  Certainly, there is no basis in "experience and history" to conclude that a State\'s attempt to provide -- through the services of its own state-selected professionals -- the remedial assistance necessary for all its children poses the same potential for </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 421 U. S. 386</a></p><p> unnecessary administrative entanglement or divisive political confrontation which concerned the Court in <em>Lemon v. Kurtzman, supra.</em>  Indeed, I see at least as much potential for divisive political debate in opposition to the crabbed attitude the Court shows in this case.  <em>See, e.g., ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#371">421 U. S. 371</a></span> n. 21.</p>\n<p>If the consequence of the Court\'s holding operated only to penalize institutions with a religious affiliation, the result would be grievous enough; nothing in the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment permits governmental power to discriminate against or affirmatively stifle religions or religious activity.  <em>Everson v. Board of Education,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html">330 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/330/1/case.html#18">330 U. S. 18</a></span> (1947).  But this holding does more:  it penalizes <em>children</em> -- children who have the misfortune to have to cope with the learning process under extraordinarily heavy physical and psychological burdens, for the most part congenital.  This penalty strikes them not because of any act of theirs, but because of their parents\' choice of religious exercise.  This, as MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST effectively demonstrates, totally turns its back on what MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote for the Court in <em>Zorach v. Clauson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html">343 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#313">343 U. S. 313</a></span>-314 (1952), particularly:</p>\n<p>"When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then respects the religious nature of our people and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs."</p>\n<p>To hold, as the Court now does, that the Constitution permits the States to give special assistance to some of its children whose handicaps prevent their deriving the benefit normally anticipated from the education required to become a productive member of society and, at the same time, to deny those benefits to other children only because they attend a Lutheran, Catholic, or other church-sponsored </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 421 U. S. 387</a></p><p> school does not simply tilt the Constitution against religion; it literally turns the Religion Clauses on their heads.  As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS said for the Court in <em>Zorach, supra,</em> this is</p>\n<p>"to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#314">343 U. S. 314</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The melancholy consequence of what the Court does today is to force the parent to choose between the "free exercise" of a religious belief by opting for a sectarian education for his child or to forgo the opportunity for his child to learn to cope with -- or overcome -- serious congenital learning handicaps, through remedial assistance financed by his taxes.  Affluent parents, by employing private teaching specialists, will be able to cope with this denial of equal protection, which is, for me, a gross violation of Fourteenth Amendment rights, but all others will be forced to make a choice between their judgment as to their children\'s spiritual needs and their temporal need for special remedial learning assistance.  One can only hope that, at some future date, the Court will come to a more enlightened and tolerant view of the First Amendment\'s guarantee of free exercise of religion, thus eliminating the denial of equal protection to children in church-sponsored schools, and take a more realistic view that carefully limited aid to children is not a step toward establishing a state religion -- at least while this Court sits.</p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST, with whom MR.

Act 195 includes a program that provides for the loan of textbooks free of charge to elementary and secondary school students attending nonpublic schools, just as other provisions of Pennsylvania law provide similar benefits to children attending public schools, Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7 8 801 . I agree with MR. JUSTICE STEWART that this program is constitutionally indistinguishable from the New York textbook loan program upheld in <em>Board of Education v. Allen,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/392/236/case.html">392 U. S. 236</a></span> (1968), and, on the authority of that case, I join the judgment of the Court insofar as it upholds the textbook loan program.</p>\n<p>The Court strike\'s down other provisions of Act 195 dealing with instructional materials and equipment [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] because it finds that they have</p>\n<p>"the unconstitutional primary effect of advancing religion because of the predominantly religious character of the schools benefiting from the Act."</p>\n<p><em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#363">421 U.

I find that approach to the "primary effect" branch of our three-pronged test no more satisfactory in the context of this instructional materials and equipment program than it was in the context of the tuition reimbursement and tax relief programs involved in <em>Nyquist, supra,</em> and <em>Sloan, supra.</em>\n</em></p>\n<p>One need look no further than to the majority opinion for a demonstration of the arbitrariness of the percentage approach to primary effect.  In determining the constitutionality of the textbook loan program established by Act 195, the plurality views the program in the context of the State\'s "well established policy of lending textbooks free of charge to elementary and secondary school students."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#360">421 U.

But when it comes time to consider the same Act\'s instructional materials and equipment program, which is not alleged to make available to private schools any materials and equipment that are not provided to public schools, [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] the majority strikes down this program because more than 75% of the nonpublic schools are church-related or religiously affiliated.</p>\n<p>If the number of sectarian schools were measured as a percentage of all schools, public and private, then no doubt the majority would conclude that the primary effect of the instructional materials and equipment program is not to advance religion. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  One looks in vain, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 421 U. S. 390</a></p><p> however, for an explanation of the majority\'s selection of the number of private schools as the denominator in its instructional materials and equipment calculations.  The only apparent explanation might be that Act 195 applies only to private schools, while different legislation, Pa.Stat.Ann., Tit. 24, \xc2\xa7 8-801, provides equipment and materials to public schools.  But surely this is not a satisfactory explanation, for the plurality tells us, in connection with its discussion of the textbook loan program, which is administered to the public schools through the same statutory provision that provides equipment and materials to the public schools, that "it is of no constitutional significance whether the general program is codified in one statute or two."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#360">421 U.

Once it is conceded that no danger of diversion exists, it is difficult to articulate any principled basis upon which to distinguish the two Act 195 programs.</p>\n<p>The Court eschews it primary effect analysis in striking down Act 194, <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#369">421 U.

The burden of proof ordinarily rests upon the plaintiff, but the Court\'s conclusion that the dangers presented by a state-subsidized guidance counselor are the same as those presented by a state-subsidized chemistry teacher is apparently no more than an <em>ex cathedra</em> pronouncement on the part of the Court, if one may use that term in a case such as this, since the District Court found the facts to be exactly the opposite -- after consideration of stipulations of fact and an evidentiary hearing:</p>\n<p>"The Commonwealth, recognizing the logistical realities, provided for traveling therapists, rather than traveling pupils.  There is no evidence whatsoever that the presence of the therapists in the schools will involve them in the religious missions of the schools. . . .  The notion that, by setting foot inside a sectarian school, a professional therapist or counselor will succumb to sectarianization of his or her professional work is not supported by any evidence."</p>\n<p>374 F.Supp. at 657.  The propensity of the Court to disregard findings of fact by district courts in Establishment Clause cases, <em>see also Lemon v.

Kurtzman, supra,</em> and companion cases marks a significant <em>sub silentio</em> extension of that 1971 decision.  In those cases, the Court struck down the Rhode Island salary supplement program, under which teachers employed by nonpublic schools could qualify for additional salary payments from the State in order to bring their salaries </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 421 U. S. 393</a></p><p> more closely in line with the prevailing scale in public schools, and a Pennsylvania program authorizing direct reimbursement to nonpublic schools; in order to qualify, the teachers could teach only subjects that were offered in the public schools.  The premise supporting the Court\'s conclusion that these programs "involve [d] excessive entanglement between government and religion," 403 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#614">403 U.

The conflict of functions inheres in the situation."</p>\n<p>(Emphasis added.)  <em>See also id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/403/602/case.html#618">403 U. S. 618</a></span>.  The auxiliary services program established by Act 194 differs from the programs struck down in <em>Lemon</em> in two important respects.  First, the opportunities for religious instruction through the auxiliary services program are greatly reduced because of the considerably more limited reach of the Act.  Unlike the core curriculum instruction provided in the <em>Lemon,</em> programs, "auxiliary services" are defined in Act 194 to embrace a narrower range of services:</p>\n<p>"\'Auxiliary services\' means guidance, counseling and testing services; psychological services; services for exceptional children; remedial and therapeutic services; speech and hearing services; services for the improvement of the educationally disadvantaged (such as, but not limited to, teaching English as a second language), and such other secular, neutral, nonideological services as are of benefit to nonpublic school children and are presently or hereafter provided for public school children of the Commonwealth."</p>\n<p>Act 194, \xc2\xa7 1(b).</p>\n<p>Even if the distinction between these services and core curricula is thought to be a matter of degree, the second </p><p><a class="page-number" name="394">Page 421 U. S. 394</a></p><p> distinction between the programs involved in <em>Lemon</em> and Act 194 is a difference in kind.  Act 194 provides that these auxiliary services shall be provided by personnel of the public school system. [<a href="#F3/4" name="T3/4">Footnote 3/4</a>]  Since the danger of entanglement articulated in <em>Lemon</em> flowed from the susceptibility of parochial school teachers to "religious control and discipline," I would have assumed that exorcisation of that constitutional "evil" would lead to a different constitutional result.  The Court does not contend that the public school employees who would administer the auxiliary services are subject to "religious control and discipline."  In fact, the Court concedes that "auxiliary services personnel, because not employed by the nonpublic schools, are not directly subject to the discipline of a religious authority."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#371">421 U. S. 371</a></span>.  The decision of the Court that Act 194 is unconstitutional rests ultimately upon the unsubstantiated factual proposition that "[t]he potential for impermissible fostering of religion under these circumstances, although somewhat reduced, is nonetheless present."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/421/349/case.html#372">421 U.

The Court apparently believes that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment not only mandates religious neutrality on the part of government, but also requires that this Court go further and throw its weight on the side of those who believe that our society as a whole should be a purely secular one.  Nothing in the First Amendment or in the cases interpreting it requires such an extreme approach to this difficult question, and</p>\n<p>"[a]ny interpretation of [the Establishment Clause] and the constitutional values it serves must also take account of the free exercise clause and the values it serves."</p>\n<p>P. Kauper, Religion and the Constitution 79 (1964).  As MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote for the Court in <em>Zorach v. Clauson,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html">343 U. S. 306</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/306/case.html#313">343 U.

When the state encourages religious instruction or cooperates with religious authorities by adjusting the schedule of public events to sectarian needs, it follows the best of our traditions.  For it then respects the religious nature of our people, and accommodates the public service to their spiritual needs.  To hold that it may not would be to find in the Constitution a requirement that the government show a callous indifference to religious groups.  That would be preferring those who believe in no religion over those who do believe.  Government may not finance religious groups nor undertake religious instruction nor blend secular and sectarian education nor use secular institutions to force one or some religion on any person.  But we find no constitutional requirement which makes it necessary for government to be hostile to religion and to throw its weight against efforts to widen the effective scope of religious influence."</p>\n<p>Except insofar as the Court upholds the textbook loan program, I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T3/1" name="F3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>]</p>\n<p>The District Court upheld these sections of Act 195 except insofar as they "permit[ted] the loan of instructional equipment which can be easily diverted to a religious use."  374 F.Supp. 639, 661 (ED Pa.1974).
