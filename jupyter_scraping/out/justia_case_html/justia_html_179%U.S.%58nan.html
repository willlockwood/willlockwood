S. 63</a></p><p></p>\n<p>This is clearly and amply set forth in <em>Ex Parte Yarbrough,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/651/case.html">110 U. S. 651</a></span>, in which this Court, speaking by Mr. Justice Miller, upheld a conviction in a circuit court of the United States under sections 5508 and 5520 of the Revised Statutes for a conspiracy to intimidate a citizen of the United States in the exercise of his right to vote for a member of Congress, and answered the proposition</p>\n<p>"that the right to vote for a member of Congress is not dependent upon the Constitution or laws of the United States, but is governed by the law of each state respectively,"</p>\n<p>as follows:</p>\n<p>"But it is not correct to say that the right to vote for a member of Congress does not depend on the Constitution of the United States.  The office, if it be properly called an office, is created by that Constitution, and by that alone.  It also declares how it shall be filled, namely, by election.  Its language is:"</p>\n<p>"The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen every second year by the people of the several states, and the electors in each state shall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch of the state legislature."</p>\n<p>"Art. 1, sec. 2.  The states, in prescribing the qualifications of voters for the most numerous branch of their own legislatures, do not do this with reference to the election for members of Congress.  Nor can they prescribe the qualification for voters for those <em>eo nomine.</em>  They define who are to vote for the popular branch of their own legislature, and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="64">Page 179 U. S. 64</a></p><p> the Constitution of the United States says the same persons shall vote for members of Congress in that state.  It adopts the qualification thus furnished as the qualification of its own electors for members of Congress.  It is not true, therefore, that electors for members of Congress own their right to vote to the state law in any sense which makes the exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the state."</p>\n<p>110 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/651/case.html#663">110 U. S. 663</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The Court then, referring to the statement of Chief Justice Waite in <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/162/case.html">Minor v. Happersett,</a></span></em> 21 Wall. 162,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/88/178/case.html">88 U. S. 178</a></span>, that "the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right of suffrage upon anyone," explained that statement as follows:</p>\n<p>"But the Court was combating the argument that this right was conferred on all citizens, and therefore upon women as well as men.  In opposition to that idea, it was said the Constitution adopts as the qualification of voters for members of Congress that which prevails in the state where the voting is to be done; therefore, said the opinion, the right is not definitely conferred on any person or class of persons by the Constitution alone, because you have to look to the law of the state for the description of the class.  But the Court did not intend to say that, when the class or the person is thus ascertained, his right to vote for a member of Congress was not fundamentally based upon the Constitution, which created the office of member of Congress, and declared it should be elective, and pointed to the means of ascertaining who should be electors."</p>\n<p>110 U.S.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/110/651/case.html#664">110 U. S. 664</a></span>.</p>\n<p>The circuit court of the United States has jurisdiction, concurrent with the courts of the state, of any action under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States in which the matter in dispute exceeds the sum or value of $2,000.  Act of August 13, 1888, c. 866, 25 Stat. 433.</p>\n<p>This action is brought against election officers to recover damages for their rejection of the plaintiff\'s vote for a member of the House of Representatives of the United States.  The complaint, by alleging that the plaintiff was at the time, under the Constitution and laws of the State of South Carolina and the Constitution and laws of the United States, a duly qualified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="65">Page 179 U. S. 65</a></p><p> elector of the state, shows that the action is brought under the Constitution and laws of the United States.</p>\n<p>The damages are laid at the sum of $2,500.  What amount of damages the plaintiff shall recover in such an action is peculiarly appropriate for the determination of a jury, and no opinion of the Court upon that subject can justify it in holding that the amount in controversy was insufficient to support the jurisdiction of the circuit court.  <em>Barry v.

Art. 1, \xc2\xa7 31; art. 8, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 2, 8.  That Constitution, in art. 8, \xc2\xa7 3, also makes it the duty of the legislature to provide from time to time for the registration of all electors.</p>\n<p>The Revised Statutes of South Carolina of 1893 provide, in \xc2\xa7 131, that every man not laboring under the disabilities named in the constitution of the state (repeating all the qualifications and the disabilities mentioned in that Constitution) shall be entitled to vote, and further provide, in \xc2\xa7 132, that all electors of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="66">Page 179 U. S. 66</a></p><p> the state shall be registered, and that no person shall be allowed to vote at any election unless theretofore registered as required by those statutes or by previous laws.</p>\n<p>The constitution and the laws of the state thus require that, in order to entitle, anyone to have his vote received at any election, he must not only have the requisite qualifications of an elector, but he must have been registered.  By elementary rules of pleading, both these essential requisites must be distinctly alleged by the plaintiff in any action against the managers of an election for refusing his vote.  <em>Murphy v. Ramsey,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/15/case.html">114 U. S. 15</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/114/15/case.html#37">114 U. S. 37</a></span>; <em>Blanchard v. Stearns,</em> 5 Met. 298, 302.</p>\n<p>The complaint in this case alleges that the plaintiff was a duly qualified elector, but it contains no allegation that he was ever registered as such.  Because of this omission, the complaint does not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.</p>\n<p>It was argued in behalf of the plaintiff that the registration act of South Carolina was unconstitutional because it allowed for registration only one day in each month between the day of a general election in November and the first day of July before the next general election; required the registration books to be closed from such first day of July for four months, until the ensuing election day, and thus in effect required each voter to reside in the county for one hundred and twenty days (whereas the Constitution required only sixty days) before the election, and otherwise unreasonably impeded the exercise of the constitutional right of voting; that the only exception allowed was in the case of voters coming of age during those four months, and there was no exception in the case of electors who, by reason of sickness or absence or other good and sufficient cause, did not or could not have registered before the first day of July.</p>\n<p>In the case in the Supreme Court of South Carolina of <em>Butler v. Ellerbe,</em> 44 S.C. 256, cited at the bar, the Chief Justice expressed his opinion that the registration act of the state was unconstitutional, but the majority of the judges declined to express any opinion upon that question, because they thought it unnecessary for the decision.  Nor should this Court undertake to decide it in the present case.</p>\n<p>Passing by the difficulty of subjecting election officers to an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="67">Page 179 U. S. 67</a></p><p> action for damages for refusing a vote which the statute under which they are appointed forbids them to receive it is by no means clear, taking into consideration all the constitutional and statutory provisions upon the subject, that the construction contended for is the true construction of the statute.</p>\n<p>But, even upon that construction, the plaintiff does not show that he is in a position to impugn the constitutionality of the statute.  It is only on the day when his vote was refused that he alleges that he had resided in the state for a year and in the county for sixty days and was of age and otherwise a qualified elector.  He does not allege when he first became qualified.  So far as appears, he may have become of age and otherwise qualified but a few days before the election day on which he tendered his vote, in which case he would confessedly, by the specific provision of section 141, have been entitled to apply for registration.  Yet he does not allege that he ever was registered or made any application to be registered.</p>\n<p>The provisions of the statutes of 1893 requiring registered voters to obtain certificates from the supervisors, the provisions for registration in earlier statutes, and the provisions of the statute of December 24, 1894, for calling a constitutional convention, enacted since the date of the election here in question, were largely commented on, and their validity impugned, in the argument for the plaintiff in error.  But the validity of none of those provisions is involved in the decision of this case.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n<p>* In the Constitution of 1868, the first article, entitled "Declaration of Rights," contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 31.  All elections shall be free and open, and every inhabitant of this commonwealth possessing the qualifications provided for in this Constitution shall have an equal right to elect officers and be elected to fill public office."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 33.  The right of suffrage shall be protected by laws regulating elections, and prohibiting, under adequate penalties, all undue influences from power, bribery, tumult, or improper conduct."</p>\n<p>The eighth article of the same Constitution, entitled "Rights of Suffrage," contains the following provisions:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 2.  Every male citizen of the United States, of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, not laboring under the disabilities named in this constitution, without distinction of race, color, or former condition, who shall be a resident of this state at the time of the adoption of this constitution or who shall thereafter reside in this state one year, and in the county in which he offers to vote sixty days, next preceding any election, shall be entitled to vote for all officers that are now or hereafter may be elected by the people, and upon all questions submitted to the electors at any elections:  Provided, that no person shall be allowed to vote or hold office who is now or hereafter may be disqualified therefor by the Constitution of the United States until such disqualification shall be removed by the Congress of the United States:  Provided further, that no person while kept in any almshouse or asylum, or of unsound mind, or confined in any public prison, shall be allowed to vote or hold office."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 3.  It shall be the duty of the general assembly to provide from time to time for the registration of all electors."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 7.  Every person entitled to vote at any election shall be eligible to any office which now is, or hereafter shall be, elective by the people in the county where he shall have resided sixty days previous to such election, except as otherwise provided in this constitution or the Constitution and laws of the United States."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 8.  The general assembly shall never pass any law that will deprive any of the citizens of this State of the right of suffrage, except for treason, murder, robbery, or dueling, whereof the person shall have been duly tried and convicted."</p>\n<p>This section was amended in 1882 by substituting for the word "robbery" the words "burglary, larceny, perjury, forgery, or any other infamous crime."</p>\n<p>The Revised Statutes of South Carolina of 1893 contain the following provisions:</p>\n<p>"SEC. 162.  The general elections for federal, state, and county officers in this state shall be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November in every second year, reckoning from the year one thousand eight hundred and seventy."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 131.  Every male citizen of the United States, of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, not laboring under the disabilities named in the Constitution, without distinction of race, color, or former condition, who shall have been a resident of the state for one year, and in the county in which he offers to vote for sixty days next preceding any general election, shall be entitled to vote:  Provided, that no person, while kept in any almshouse or asylum, or of unsound mind, or confined in any public prison, or who shall have been convicted of treason, murder, burglary, larceny, perjury, forgery, or any other infamous crime, or dueling, shall be allowed to vote."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 132.  All electors of the state shall be registered, and no person shall be allowed to vote at any election hereafter to be held unless he shall have been heretofore registered in conformity with the requirements of chapter 7 of the General Statutes of 1882, and acts amendatory thereof, or shall be registered as herein required."</p>\n<p>Sections 133-136 provide for the appointment of a supervisor and two assistant supervisors of registration in each county, and establish registration precincts.</p>\n<p>"SEC. 137.  After every general election, the registration books shall be opened, for registration of such persons as shall thereafter become entitled to register, on the first Monday in each month until the first day of July preceding a general election, when the same shall be closed until such general election shall have taken place."</p>\n<p>Section 138 requires the books of registration to be deposited and safely kept in the office of a certain clerk or registrar.</p>\n<p>"SEC. 139.  The supervisor shall determine as to the legal qualifications of all applicants for registration by summary process, requiring oath, evidence, or both, if he deem proper, subject to revision by the assistant supervisors and himself in all cases where he has refused to register an applicant.  From their decision any applicant who is rejected shall have the right to a review thereof by the circuit court, provided he give notice in writing to the supervisor of his application for such review, and the grounds thereof, within five days from the date of his rejection, and commence his proceedings within ten days from the service of said notice."</p>\n<p>"SEC. 140.
