Blue Cross refused on the basis of its policy barring participation by any new hospital that could not show that it was meeting a clearly evident need for health care services in its service area.  Blue Cross relied on petitioner\'s failure to obtain approval for construction from the Mid-America Health Systems Agency (MAHSA), a private, nonprofit, federally funded corporation which was the local "health system agency" (HSA) designated for the area under the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA).

S. 380</a></p><p></p>\n<p>JUSTICE POWELL delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>The petitioner in this case, National Gerimedical Hospital and Gerontology Center (National Gerimedical) filed an antitrust suit against respondents, Blue Cross of Kansas City (Blue Cross) and the national Blue Cross Association, challenging the refusal of Blue Cross to accept petitioner as a participating member provider under its health insurance plan.  The issue presented here is whether this refusal by Blue Cross is immunized from antitrust scrutiny because it was intended to aid implementation of the plans of the "health systems agency" designated for the Kansas City area under the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974.</p>\n<p></p><h3>I</h3><p></p>\n<p>Petitioner National Gerimedical is a private, acute care community hospital opened in 1978 in the Kansas City, Mo., metropolitan area. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Prior to the completion of construction, petitioner sought to enter into a participating hospital agreement with Blue Cross, a nonprofit provider of individual and group health care reimbursement plans in Missouri and Kansas.  Under such an agreement, participating hospitals receive direct reimbursement of the full costs of covered services rendered to individual Blue Cross subscribers. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  When subscribers receive care in hospitals that are not participating members, Blue Cross pays only 80% of the cost, and these payments are made to the subscriber, rather than directly to the hospital. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="381">Page 452 U. S. 381</a></p><p></p>\n<p>Blue Cross refused to enter into a participating hospital agreement with petitioner on the basis of its official policy barring participation by any new hospital that could not show that it was meeting "a clearly evident need for health care services in its defined service area." [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  In determining that petitioner had not satisfied this requirement, Blue Cross relied on petitioner\'s failure to obtain approval for construction from the local "health systems agency" or "HSA" -- the Mid-America Health Systems Agency (MAHSA). [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  This agency is a private, nonprofit corporation, federally funded under the National Health Planning and Resources Development Act of 1974 (NHPRDA), 88 Stat. 2229, as amended, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em> (1976 ed. and Supp. IV).  Its major function is health planning for the Kansas City metropolitan area.</p>\n<p>In conducting its planning functions, MAHSA had determined that there was a surplus of hospital beds in the area, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="382">Page 452 U. S. 382</a></p><p> and had announced that it would not approve any addition of acute care beds in area hospitals.  As a result of this announced policy, petitioner did not seek MAHSA approval of its construction, leading to the refusal of participating hospital status by Blue Cross.</p>\n<p>Claiming that this refusal by Blue Cross put it at a competitive disadvantage, petitioner filed suit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri against Blue Cross and the national Blue Cross Association.  It claimed violations of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 1, 2, alleging a wrongful refusal to deal and a conspiracy between Blue Cross and MAHSA. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  As relief, petitioner sought treble damages and an injunction to prevent future violations.</p>\n<p>Respondents moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that the NHPRDA had impliedly repealed the antitrust laws as applied to the conduct in question. [<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  The District Court treated this motion as one for summary judgment, and granted judgment for respondents.  479 F.Supp. 1012 (1979).  It reasoned that, if private parties seeking to effectuate the planning objectives of an HSA could be subjected to antitrust liability, accomplishment of the goals of the NHPRDA would be frustrated.  <em>Id.</em> at 1021.  Having found a "clear repugnancy," <em>id.</em> at 1024, between this Act and the antitrust laws, the court relied largely on legislative history for the view that</p>\n<p>"Congress intended that action taken pursuant to the Act and clearly within the scope of the Act would be exempt from application of the antitrust laws."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="383">Page 452 U. S. 383</a></p><p></p>\n<p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed, essentially adopting the reasoning of the District Court.  628 F.2d 1050 (1980).  The Court of Appeals agreed with the District Court\'s</p>\n<p>"finding of clear repugnancy between the Act and the antitrust laws, as the Act and regulatory scheme clearly call for the action which has now become the basis of an antitrust claim."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at 1055-1056.  It then quoted in full the District Court\'s argument for the view that Congress intended repeal of the antitrust laws in this context.</p>\n<p>We granted a writ of certiorari to review this important question. 449 U.S. 1123 (1981).</p>\n<p></p><h3>II</h3><p></p>\n<p>Our decision in this case requires careful attention to the structure and goals of the NHPRDA, as well as a review of this Court\'s decisions in the area of implied repeals of the antitrust laws.  We begin with a description of the complex scheme of regulatory and planning agencies established by the NHPRDA in order to assess the legal significance of that Act with respect to the antitrust claim brought here.</p>\n<p>MAHSA, the health systems agency whose refusal to approve new hospital construction in the Kansas City area prompted Blue Cross not to accept petitioner as a participating hospital, is but one part of a larger statutory scheme.  The NHPRDA, 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300k <em>et seq.,</em> created federal. state, and local bodies that coordinate their activities in the area of health planning and policy.  Building on existing planning and development statutes, [<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>] Congress sought in 1974 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="384">Page 452 U. S. 384</a></p><p> to create a statutory scheme that would assist in preventing overinvestment in and maldistribution of health facilities.  <em>See</em> 1974 Senate Report at 39.</p>\n<p>HSA\'s such as MAHSA are concerned with health planning in a particular metropolitan area.  <em>See generally</em> H.R.Rep. No. 93 1382, pp. 401 (1974).  Each is a nonprofit private corporation, public regional planning body, or single unit of local government, serving a particular "health service area."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-1(b)(1).  The statute requires that a majority of HSA board members be consumers of health care, and that at least 40% be health care "providers."  300<em>l</em>-1(b)(3)(C).  The "primary responsibility" of each HSA is</p>\n<p>"effective health planning for its health service area and the promotion of the development within the area of health services, manpower, and facilities which meet identified needs, reduce documented inefficiencies, and implement the health plans of the agency."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(a).  As originally enacted, the Act established four general goals:  "improving the health of residents," "increasing the accessibility . . . , acceptability, continuity, and quality of . . . health services," "restraining increases in the cost of . . . health services," and "\'preventing unnecessary duplication of health resources."  \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(a). [<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  To accomplish these goals, the Act requires each HSA to formulate a "detailed statement of goals" called a "health systems plan," \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(b)(2), an "annual implementation plan" describing the objectives that will achieve the goals of the general plan, \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(b)(3), </p><p><a class="page-number" name="385">Page 452 U. S. 385</a></p><p> and "specific plans and projects for achieving the objectives established in the" annual implementation plan, \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(b)(4).  Each HSA is instructed to</p>\n<p>"seek, to the extent practicable, to implement [its plans] with the assistance of individuals and public and private entities in its health service area."</p>\n<p>\xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(c)(1).  In addition, it may provide "technical assistance" to individuals and public and private entities for the development of necessary projects and programs, \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(c)(2), and should use grants and contracts to encourage these projects and programs, \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>-2(c)(3). The agencies do not possess regulatory authority over health care providers.</p>\n<p>\xef\xbf\xbd</p>\n<p>At the state level, the Act created two separate bodies.  The first, a State Health Planning and Development Agency, is a state agency created by agreement between a Governor and the Federal Government.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 300m.  It is intended to perform certain crucial functions that cannot be undertaken by local HSA\'s:</p>\n<p>"Specifically, the integration and synthesis of areawide health plans into a Statewide health plan, the establishment of priorities within the State, and the performance of regulatory functions are most appropriately carried out at the State level.  The latter function can appropriately be carried out only by an agency of State government."</p>\n<p>1974 Senate Report at 52.  Each state agency must be governed by a "State Program," which the Secretary of Health and Human Services may approve only if it meets guidelines set out in 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 300m-1, 300m-2.  Included in these guidelines is the requirement that each State establish a "certificate of need" program under which all new institutional health facilities must seek state approval prior to construction.  \xc2\xa7 300m-2(a)(4)(A). [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]  This procedure is</p>\n<p>"the basic component in an </p><p><a class="page-number" name="386">Page 452 U. S. 386</a></p><p> overall effort to control the unnecessary capital expenditures which contribute so greatly to the total national health bill."</p>\n<p>S.Rep. No. 96-96, p. 5 (1979) (hereinafter 1979 Senate Report).</p>\n<p>The State Health Planning and Development Agency is advised by a Statewide Health Coordinating Council, composed in part of representatives of local HSA\'s.  This council is empowered to review the plans of HSA\'s, review and revise state plans, and make recommendations with respect to applications for federal funds from HSA\'s and States.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300m-3(c).</p>\n<p>In addition to various review functions, the Federal Government plays a separate role in this statutory scheme.  The NHPRDA requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to issue guidelines concerning the appropriate supply, distribution, and organization of health resources.  \xc2\xa7 300k-1; <em>see</em> 42 CFR \xc2\xa7 121.1 <em>et seq.</em> (1980).  Finally, the Act created a National Council on Health Planning and Development to advise the Secretary on these guidelines and on the general administration of the Act.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300k-3.</p>\n<p>This elaborate planning structure was intended by Congress to remedy perceived deficiencies in the performance of the health care industry as it existed prior to 1974.  The problems addressed fall into two categories.  First, there was concern that marketplace forces in this industry failed to produce efficient investment in facilities and to minimize the costs of health care. [<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  In addition, Congress sought to reduce the maldistribution of health care facilities. [<a href="#F11" name="T11">Footnote 11</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="387">Page 452 U. S. 387</a></p><p></p>\n<p>In 1979, Congress amended the NHPRDA substantially in the Health Planning and Resources Development Amendments of 1979, Pub.L. 96-79, 93 Stat. 592.  A purpose of these Amendments was to</p>\n<p>"[d]irect that special consideration be given throughout the planning process to the importance of maintaining and improving competition in the health industry."</p>\n<p>1979 Senate Report at 3. [<a href="#F12" name="T12">Footnote 12</a>]  Toward this end, Congress added a number of provisions requiring promotion of competition at the local, state, and federal levels.  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 300k-2(b), 300<em>l</em>-2(a)(5) (1976 ed., Supp. IV); 42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 \xc2\xa7 300n-1(c)(11), (1 2) (1976 ed., Supp . IV).  <em>See generally</em> H.R.Conf.Rep. No. 96-420, p. 58 (1979).  In so doing, however, Congress recognized a distinction between areas where competition could serve a useful purpose and </p><p><a class="page-number" name="388">Page 452 U. S. 388</a></p><p> those where some other allocation of resources remained necessary. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>National Gerimedical contends that the denial by Blue Cross of participating hospital status violated the antitrust laws.  Blue Cross defends on the ground that it acted pursuant to the local HSA plan and only intended to further the purposes of the NHPRDA.  It argues that, despite the absence of any reference to the antitrust laws in the NHPRDA, the creation of the planning structure summarized above implied a repeal of those laws, as applied to this conduct.</p>\n<p>On a number of occasions, this Court has faced similar claims of antitrust immunity in the context of various regulated industries.  The general principles applicable to such claims are well established.  The antitrust laws represent a "fundamental national economic policy."  <em>Carnation Co. v.

National Association of Securities Dealers, supra; Gordon v. New York Stock Exchange, supra,</em> but this intent must be clear.  Even when an industry is regulated substantially, this does not necessarily evidence an intent to repeal the antitrust laws with respect to every action taken within the industry.  <em>E.g., Otter Tail Power Co. v. United States,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/366/case.html">410 U.

S. 690</a></span>.</p>\n<p>In the present case, we must apply these precedents to an industry with a regulatory structure quite different from those considered previously. The action challenged here was neither compelled nor approved by any governmental regulatory body.  Instead, it was a spontaneous response to the finding of an advisory planning body, the local HSA, that there was a surplus of acute care hospital beds in the Kansas City area. [<a href="#F14" name="T14">Footnote 14</a>]  Indeed, when respondents refused to enter into </p><p><a class="page-number" name="390">Page 452 U. S. 390</a></p><p> the agreement with petitioner, the regulatory aspects of the NHPRDA -- controlled by the state health planning agencies -- were not in place in Missouri.  There simply was no regulation of this hospital construction, as Missouri had not established any state regulatory agency with authority to review hospital construction. [<a href="#F15" name="T15">Footnote 15</a>]</p>\n<p>As a result, the claim of implied antitrust immunity in this case is weaker than in previous cases.  It cannot be argued that application of the antitrust laws to the conduct of Blue Cross would frustrate a particular provision of the NHPRDA or create a conflict with the orders of any regulatory body.  The record discloses no formal request from MAHSA to Blue Cross to refrain from accepting petitioner as a new participating hospital.  Even if such a request had been made, it could not have been more than the advice of a private planning body -- albeit a planning body created and funded by the Federal Government.  This fact is crucial, because antitrust repeals are especially disfavored where the antitrust implications of a business decision have not been considered by a governmental entity.  <em>United States v.

Here, respondents argue, the HSA found that petitioner was duplicating hospital facilities unnecessarily, and Blue Cross merely sought to aid in the "implementation" of that finding.</p>\n<p>We are unpersuaded, however, that the provisions cited by respondents are sufficient to create a "clear repugnancy" between the NHPRDA and the antitrust laws, at least on the facts of this case.  <em>See</em> <a href="#F18" name="T18">n</a> 18 <em>infra.</em>  Nothing in the NHPRDA requires Blue Cross to take an action that, in essence, sought to enforce the advisory decision of MAHSA.  HSA\'s themselves are required to seek private cooperation only "to the extent practicable."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300<em>l</em>2(c)(1).  And there is no reason to believe that Congress specifically contemplated such "enforcement" by private insurance providers, let alone relied on such actions to put "teeth" into the noncompulsory local planning process.  Congress expected HSA planning to be implemented mainly through persuasion and cooperation.  If an HSA recommendation could be used to justify antitrust immunity for such an act of private enforcement, this effectively would give that recommendation greater force than Congress intended. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]</p>\n<p>As there is no direct conflict between the requirements of the NHPRDA and the Sherman Act with respect to the conduct at issue here, respondents\' only remaining argument must be that the NHPRDA immunizes all private conduct </p><p><a class="page-number" name="392">Page 452 U. S. 392</a></p><p> undertaken in response to the health planning process.  Arguably, the fundamental assumption of Congress, particularly in 1974 when it passed the original Act, [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>] was that competition was not a relevant consideration in the health care industry.  If so, although that industry is not regulated in any comprehensive fashion, it might be concluded that Congress intended "pervasive" cooperation and planning without the interference of antitrust suits.</p>\n<p>This argument has some force, in light of the prominence Congress gave to the view that "the health care industry does not respond to classic marketplace forces."  1974 Senate Report at 39.  Perhaps it makes little sense in such a context to entertain antitrust suits intended to promote or protect free competition.  It is clear, however, that respondents have failed to make the showing necessary for an exemption of all actions of health care providers taken in response to planning recommendations.  In other industrial contexts, we have refused such a blanket exemption, despite a clear congressional finding that some substitution of regulation for competition was necessary.  <em>Carnation Co. v.

S. 357</a></span>.  There is no indication that Congress intended a different result with respect to the health care industry.  One manifestation of this is the fact that, in the 1979 Amendments, Congress did not alter the basic planning structure, even as it made plain its intent that "competition and consumer choice" are to be favored wherever they "can constructively serve . . . to advance the purposes of quality </p><p><a class="page-number" name="393">Page 452 U. S. 393</a></p><p> assurance, cost effectiveness, and access."  42 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 300k2(a)(17) (1976 ed., Supp. IV). [<a href="#F18" name="T18">Footnote 18</a>]</p>\n<p>We hold, therefore, that the NHPRDA is not so incompatible with antitrust concerns as to create a "pervasive" repeal of the antitrust laws as applied to every action taken in response to the health care planning process.  Moreover, as discussed above, there was no specific conflict between the Act and the antitrust laws in this case.  Although respondents may well have acted here with only the highest of motives in seeking to implement the plans of the local HSA, they cannot defeat petitioner\'s antitrust claim by the assertion of immunity from the requirements of the Sherman Act.

It added that, where "competition appropriately allocates supply consistent with health systems plans and State health plans," planning agencies should "give priority . . . to actions which would strengthen the effect of competition on the supply of such services."  \xc2\xa7 300k-2(b)(3).
