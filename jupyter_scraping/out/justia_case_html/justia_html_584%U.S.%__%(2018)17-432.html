The question presented in this case is whether <i>American Pipe</i> tolling applies not only to individual claims, but to successive class actions as well.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">This suit is the third class action brought on behalf of purchasers of petitioner China Agritech\xe2\x80\x99s common stock, alleging materially identical violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  The Act has both a two-year statute of limitations and a five-year statute of repose,\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(b).  Here, the accrual date for purposes of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s limitation period is February 3, 2011, and for the repose period, November 12, 2009.  Theodore Dean, a China Agritech shareholder, filed the first class-action complaint on February 11, 2011.  As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), his counsel posted notice of the action and invited any member of the purported class to move to serve as lead plaintiff.  Six shareholders sought lead-plaintiff status.  On May 3, 2012, the District Court denied class certification; the action settled in September 2012, and the suit was dismissed.  On October 4, Dean\xe2\x80\x99s counsel filed a new complaint (<i>Smyth</i>), still timely, with a new set of plaintiffs.  Eight shareholders sought lead-plaintiff appointment in response to the PSLRA notice, but the District Court again denied class certification.  Thereafter, the <i>Smyth</i> plaintiffs settled their individual claims and dismissed their suit.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Respondent Michael Resh, who did not seek lead-plaintiff status in the earlier actions, filed the present class action in 2014, a year and a half after the statute of limitations expired.  The other respondents moved to intervene in the suit commenced by Resh, seeking lead-plaintiff status.  The District Court dismissed the class complaint as untimely, holding that the <i>Dean</i> and <i>Smyth</i> actions did not toll the time to initiate class claims.  The Ninth Circuit reversed, holding that the reasoning of <i>American Pipe</i> extends to successive class claims.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0Upon denial of class certification, a putative class member may not, in lieu of promptly joining an existing suit or promptly filing an individual action, commence a class action anew beyond the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations.

The \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency and economy of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d that support tolling of individual claims, <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 553, do not support maintenance of untimely successive class actions such as the one brought by Resh.  Economy of litigation favors delaying individual claims until after a class-certification denial.  With class claims, on the other hand, efficiency favors early assertion of competing class representative claims.  If class treatment is appropriate, and all would-be representatives have come forward, the district court can select the best plaintiff with knowledge of the full array of potential class representatives and class counsel.  And if the class mechanism is not a viable option, the decision denying certification will be made at the outset of the case, litigated once for all would-be class representatives.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Federal Rule of Procedure 23 evinces a preference for preclusion of untimely successive class actions by instructing that class certification should be resolved early on.  The PSLRA, which governs this litigation, evinces a similar preference, this time embodied in legislation providing for early notice and lead-plaintiff procedures.  There is little reason to allow plaintiffs who passed up opportunities to participate in the first (and second) round of class litigation to enter the fray several years after class proceedings first commenced.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Class representatives who commence suit after expiration of the limitation period are unlikely to qualify as diligent in asserting claims and pursuing relief.  See, <i>e.g., McQuiggin </i>v.<i> Perkins</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 391.  And respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed reading would allow extension of the statute of limitations time and again; as each class is denied certification, a new named plaintiff could file a class complaint that resuscitates the litigation.  Endless tolling of a statute of limitations is not a result envisioned by <i>American Pipe</i>.  Pp.\xc2\xa05\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0If Resh\xe2\x80\x99s suit meets the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b), respondents assert, the suit should be permitted to proceed as a class action in keeping with <i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393.  <i>Shady Grove</i>, however, addressed a case in which a Rule 23 class action could have been maintained absent a state law proscribing class actions, while Resh\xe2\x80\x99s class action would be untimely unless saved by <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s tolling exception.  Rule 23 itself does not address timeliness of claims or tolling and nothing in the Rule calls for the revival of class claims if individual claims are tolled. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">The clarification of <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reach does not run afoul of the Rules Enabling Act by abridging or modifying a substantive right.  Plaintiffs have no substantive right to bring claims outside the statute of limitations.  Nor is the clarification likely to cause a substantial increase in the number of protective class-action filings.  Several Courts of Appeals have already declined to read <i>American Pipe</i> to permit a successive class action filed outside the limitations period, and there is no showing that these Circuits have experienced a disproportionate number of duplicative, protective class-action filings.  Multiple filings, moreover, could aid a district court in determining, early on, whether class treatment is warranted, and if so, who would be the best representative.  The Federal Rules provide a range of mechanisms to aid district courts in overseeing complex litigation, but they offer no reason to permit plaintiffs to exhume failed class actions by filing new, untimely class claims.

The Court held in <i>American Pipe</i> that the timely filing of a class action tolls the applicable statute of limitations for all persons encompassed by the class complaint.

Our answer is no.  <i>American Pipe </i>tolls the statute of limitations during the pendency of a putative class action, allowing unnamed class members to join the action individually or file individual claims if the class fails.

As required by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA),\n\n109Stat.\n737, Dean\xe2\x80\x99s counsel posted notice of the action in two \xe2\x80\x9cwidely circulated national business-oriented publication[s],\xe2\x80\x9d\n\n15 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(3)(A)(i), and invited any member of the purported class to move to serve as lead plaintiff.  App. 274\xe2\x80\x93280.  Six shareholders responded to the notice, seeking to be named lead plaintiffs; other shareholders who had filed their own class complaints dismissed them in view of the <i>Dean</i> action.  On May 3, 2012, after several months of discovery and deferral of a lead-plaintiff ruling, the District Court denied class certification.  The plaintiffs, the District Court determined, had failed to establish that China Agritech stock traded on an efficient market\xe2\x80\x94a necessity for proving reliance on a classwide basis.  App. 192.  Dean\xe2\x80\x99s counsel then published a notice informing shareholders of the certification denial and advising: \xe2\x80\x9cYou must act yourself to protect your rights.  You may protect your rights by joining in the current Action as a plaintiff or by filing your own action against China Agritech.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 281\xe2\x80\x93282.  The <i>Dean</i> action settled in September 2012, occasioning dismissal of the suit.  See 857 F.\xc2\xa03d 994, 998 (CA9 2017).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On October 4, 2012\xe2\x80\x94within the two-year statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94Dean\xe2\x80\x99s counsel filed a new complaint (<i>Smyth</i>) with a new set of plaintiffs and new efficient-market evidence.  Eight shareholders responded to the PSLRA notice, seeking lead-plaintiff appointment.  The District Court again denied class certification, this time on typicality and adequacy grounds.  See App. 254.  Thereafter, the <i>Smyth</i> plaintiffs settled their individual claims with the defendants and voluntarily dismissed their suit.  Because the <i>Smyth</i> litigation was timely commenced, putative class members who promptly initiated <i>individual</i> suits in the wake of the class-action denial would have encountered no statute of limitations bar.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondent Michael Resh, who had not sought lead-plaintiff status in either the <i>Dean</i> or <i>Smyth</i> proceedings and was represented by counsel who had not appeared in the earlier actions, filed the present suit on June 30, 2014, styling it a class action\xe2\x80\x94a year and a half after the statute of limitations expired.  The other respondents moved to intervene, seeking designation as lead plaintiffs; together with Resh, they filed an amended complaint.  The District Court dismissed the class complaint as untimely, holding that the <i>Dean</i> and <i>Smyth</i> actions did not toll the time to initiate class claims.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 36a.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed: \xe2\x80\x9c[P]ermitting future class action named plaintiffs, who were unnamed class members in previously uncertified classes, to avail themselves of <i>American Pipe</i> tolling,\xe2\x80\x9d the court reasoned, \xe2\x80\x9cwould advance the policy objectives that led the Supreme Court to permit tolling in the first place.\xe2\x80\x9d  857 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1004.  Applying <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to successive class actions, the Ninth Circuit added, would cause no unfair surprise to defendants and would promote economy of litigation by reducing incentives for filing protective class suits during the pendency of an initial certification motion.  857 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1004.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari, 583 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), in view of a division of authority among the Courts of Appeals over whether otherwise-untimely successive class claims may be salvaged by <i>American Pipe</i> tolling.

Neither decision so much as hints that tolling extends to otherwise time-barred class claims.

The \xe2\x80\x9cefficiency and economy of litigation\xe2\x80\x9d that support tolling of individual claims, <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 553, do not support maintenance of untimely successive class actions; any additional <i>class</i> filings should be made early on, soon after the commencement of the first action seeking class certification.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>American Pipe </i>tolls the limitation period for individual claims because economy of litigation favors delaying those claims until after a class-certification denial.

See, <i>e.g., McQuiggin </i>v.<i> Perkins</i>,\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, 391 (2013); <i>Menominee Tribe of Wis. </i>v.<i> United States</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2016) (slip op., at 5).  Even <i>American Pipe</i>, which did not analyze \xe2\x80\x9ccriteria of the formal doctrine of equitable tolling in any direct manner,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ANZ</i>, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 10\xe2\x80\x9311), observed that tolling was permissible in the circumstances because plaintiffs who later intervened to pursue individual claims had not slept on their rights, <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 554\xe2\x80\x93555.  Those plaintiffs reasonably relied on the class representative, who sued timely, to protect their interests in their individual claims.  See <i>Crown, Cork</i>, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 350.  A would-be class representative who commences suit after expiration of the limitation period, however, can hardly qualify as diligent in asserting claims and pursuing relief.  Her interest in representing the class as lead plaintiff, therefore, would not be preserved by the prior plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s timely filed class suit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 proposed reading would allow the statute of limitations to be extended time and again; as each class is denied certification, a new named plaintiff could file a class complaint that resuscitates the litigation.  See <i>Yang</i>, 392 F. 3d, at 113 (Alito, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (tolling for successive class actions could allow \xe2\x80\x9clawyers seeking to represent a plaintiff class [to] extend the statute of limitations almost indefinitely until they find a district court judge who is willing to certify the class\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Ewing Industries Corp. </i>v. <i>Bob Wines Nursery, Inc.</i>, 795 F.\xc2\xa03d 1324, 1326 (CA11 2015) (tolling for successive class actions allows plaintiffs \xe2\x80\x9climitless bites at the apple\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  This prospect points up a further distinction between the individual-claim tolling established by <i>American Pipe</i> and tolling for successive class actions.  The time to file individual actions once a class action ends is finite, extended only by the time the class suit was pending; the time for filing successive class suits, if tolling were allowed, could be limitless.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 claims happen to be governed by\n\n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71658(b)(2)\xe2\x80\x99s five-year statute of repose, so the time to file complaints has a finite end.  Statutes of repose, however, are not ubiquitous.  See <i>Dekalb County Pension Fund </i>v.<i> Transocean Ltd.</i>, 817 F.\xc2\xa03d 393, 397 (CA2 2016).  Most statutory schemes provide for a single limitation period without any outer limit to safeguard against serial relitigation.  Endless tolling of a statute of limitations is not a result envisioned by <i>American Pipe</i>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Respondents emphasize that in <i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393 (2010), we said that \xe2\x80\x9ca class action may be maintained,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 398 (internal quotation marks omitted), if the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b) are satisfied, and \xe2\x80\x9cRule 23 <i>automatically</i> applies in all civil actions and proceedings in the United States district courts,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 400 (internal quotation marks omitted).  See Brief for Respondents 21\xe2\x80\x9323.  If Resh\xe2\x80\x99s suit meets the requirements of Rule 23(a) and (b), respondents assert, there is no reason why Resh\xe2\x80\x99s suit cannot proceed as a class action.  <i>Shady Grove</i> does not call for that outcome.  In <i>Shady Grove</i>, the Court held that a federal diversity action could proceed under Rule 23 despite a state law prohibiting class treatment of suits seeking damages of the kind asserted in the <i>Shady Grove</i> complaint.  559 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 396, 416.  Our opinion in <i>Shady Grove</i> addressed a case in which a Rule 23 class action could have been maintained absent a contrary state-law command.  <i>Id.</i>, at 396.  Resh\xe2\x80\x99s case presents the reverse situation: The class action would be untimely unless saved by <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s equitable-tolling exception to statutes of limitations.  Rule 23 itself does not address timeliness of claims or tolling and nothing in the Rule calls for the revival of class claims if individual claims are tolled.  In fact, as already explained, Rule 23 prescribes the opposite result.  See <i>supra,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Today\xe2\x80\x99s clarification of <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reach does not run afoul of the Rules Enabling Act by causing a plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s attempted recourse to Rule 23 to abridge or modify a substantive right.  See Brief for Respondents 23\xe2\x80\x9326 (citing <i>Tyson Foods, Inc.</i> v. <i>Bouaphakeo</i>, 577 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2016)).  Plaintiffs have no substantive right to bring their claims outside the statute of limitations.  That they may do so, in limited circumstances, is due to a judicially crafted tolling rule that itself does not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive right.  <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 558.  Without <i>American Pipe</i>, respondents would have no peg to seek tolling here; as we have explained, however, <i>American Pipe</i> does not provide for the extension of the statute of limitations sought by Resh for institution of an untimely third class suit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents urge that <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s logic in fact supports their position because declining to toll the limitation period for successive class suits will lead to a \xe2\x80\x9cneedless multiplicity\xe2\x80\x9d of protective class-action filings.  Brief for Respondents 32\xe2\x80\x9334.  See also <i>post, </i>at 6\xe2\x80\x937 (expressing concern about duplicative and dueling class actions).  But there is little reason to think that protective class filings will substantially increase.  Several Courts of Appeals have already declined to read <i>American Pipe</i> to permit a successive class action filed outside the limitation period.  See <i>supra,</i> at 5; 3 W. Rubenstein, Newberg on Class Actions \xc2\xa79:64, n.\xc2\xa05 (5th ed. 2012).  These courts include the Second and Fifth Circuits (no strangers to class-action practice); both courts declined to entertain out-of-time class actions in the 1980\xe2\x80\x99s.  See <i>Korwek</i>, 827 F.\xc2\xa02d 874 (CA2 1987); <i>Salazar-Calderon</i>, 765 F.\xc2\xa02d 1334 (CA5 1985).  Respondents and their <i>amici</i> make no showing that these Circuits have experienced a disproportionate number of duplicative, protective class-action filings.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Amicus</i> National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems cites examples of protective filings responding to courts\xe2\x80\x99 disallowance of <i>American Pipe</i> tolling for statutes of repose, but those examples in fact suggest that protective class filings are uncommon.  See Brief of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 7\xe2\x80\x938.  Between dozens and hundreds of class plaintiffs filed protective <i>individual</i> claims while class-certification motions were pending in securities cases and the statute of repose was about to run out, placing a permanent bar against their claims.  <i>Ibid.  </i>But none of the plaintiffs appears to have filed a protective <i>class</i> action\xe2\x80\x94even though, if the statute of repose expired and the pending class-certification motions were denied, there would be no further opportunity to assert class claims.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor do the incentives of class-action practice suggest that many more plaintiffs will file protective class claims as a result of our holding.  Any plaintiff whose individual claim is worth litigating on its own rests secure in the knowledge that she can avail herself of <i>American Pipe</i> tolling if certification is denied to a first putative class.  The plaintiff who seeks to preserve the ability to lead the class\xe2\x80\x94whether because her claim is too small to make an individual suit worthwhile or because of an attendant financial benefit[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]\xe2\x80\x94has every reason to file a class action early, and little reason to wait in the wings, giving another plaintiff first shot at representation.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, as previously explained, see <i>supra,</i> at 6\xe2\x80\x938, a multiplicity of class-action filings is not necessarily \xe2\x80\x9cneedless.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, multiple filings may aid a district court in determining, early on, whether class treatment is warranted, and if so, which of the contenders would be the best representative.  And sooner rather than later filings are just what Rule 23 encourages.  See <i>ibid</i>.  Multiple timely filings might not line up neatly; they could be filed in different districts, at different times\xe2\x80\x94perhaps when briefing on class certification has already begun\xe2\x80\x94or on behalf of only partially overlapping classes.  See Wasserman, Dueling Class Actions, 80 B.\xc2\xa0U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 461, 464\xe2\x80\x93465 (2000) (describing variety of \xe2\x80\x9cdueling\xe2\x80\x9d class filings).  But district courts have ample tools at their disposal to manage the suits, including the ability to stay, consolidate, or transfer proceedings.  District courts are increasingly familiar with overseeing such complex cases, given the surge in multidistrict litigation.  See Cabraser &amp; Issacharoff, The Participatory Class Action, 92 N. Y. U. L. Rev. 846, 850\xe2\x80\x93851 (2017) (multidistrict litigation frequently combines individual suits and multiple putative class actions).  The Federal Rules provide a range of mechanisms to aid courts in this endeavor.  What the Rules do not offer is a reason to permit plaintiffs to exhume failed class actions by filing new, untimely class claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The watchwords of <i>American Pipe</i> are efficiency and economy of litigation, a principal purpose of Rule 23 as well.  Extending <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to successive class actions does not serve that purpose.  The contrary rule, allowing no tolling for out-of-time class actions, will propel putative class representatives to file suit well within the limitation period and seek certification promptly.

See, <i>e.g., Cortina </i>v.<i> Anavex Life Sciences Corp.</i>, 2016 WL 1337305 (SDNY, Apr. 5, 2016).  District courts often permit aggregation of plaintiffs into plaintiff groups, so even a small shareholder could apply for lead-plaintiff status, hoping to join with other shareholders to create a unit with the largest financial interest.

See <i>ante,</i> at 4.  One might naturally think, then, that the class claims in the lawsuit are timely.  The majority, however, concludes that the named plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 and putative class members\xe2\x80\x99 class claims are time barred.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At first blush, this result might seem surprising, for the Court has rejected the idea that class claims are categorically different from individual claims.  See <i>Shady Grove Orthopedic Associates, P.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Allstate Ins. Co.</i>,\n\n559 U.\xc2\xa0S. 393, 398 (2010).  Although it did not hold that class claims may never be treated differently from individual claims, <i>Shady</i> <i>Grove</i> indicates that there must be a special reason for doing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the PSLRA supplies that special reason.  The PSLRA imposes significant procedural requirements on securities class actions that do not apply to individual or traditionally joined securities claims.  See \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(1).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Foremost among these requirements is a process for the \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ppointment of lead plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(3).  Under the PSLRA, the named plaintiff in a putative class action must publish within 20 days of filing the complaint a nationwide notice alerting putative class members to the filing of the suit and informing them that, \xe2\x80\x9cnot later than 60 days after the date on which the notice is published, any member of the purported class may move the court to serve as lead plaintiff.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(3)(A)(i).  The district court then must evaluate all prospective lead plaintiffs and choose the \xe2\x80\x9cmost adequate\xe2\x80\x9d one based on a set of enumerated considerations.  \xc2\xa778u\xe2\x80\x934(a)(3)(B).  The PSLRA thus contemplates a process by which all prospective class representatives come forward in the first-filed class action and make their arguments to the court for lead-plaintiff status.  See H.\xc2\xa0R. Conf. Rep. No. 104\xe2\x80\x93369, p.\xc2\xa032 (1995).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Respondents here bypassed that statutory process.  They do not dispute that notice was published in the two earlier-filed putative class actions concerning the same securities claims as here, as required by the PSLRA.  Yet they did not seek to be chosen lead plaintiffs in either of those actions.  See <i>ante, </i>at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 8.  For that reason alone, I agree with the majority that respondents \xe2\x80\x9ccan hardly qualify as diligent in asserting [class] claims and pursuing relief.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante, </i>at 9.  Respondents\xe2\x80\x99 failure to utilize the PSLRA\xe2\x80\x99s lead-plaintiff selection procedure distinguishes them from the <i>American Pipe</i> absent class members, who were subject only to the traditional Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23 class procedure, which is \xe2\x80\x9cdesigned to avoid, rather than encourage, unnecessary filing of repetitious papers and motions.\xe2\x80\x9d  414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 550.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike the PSLRA, Rule 23 contains no requirement of precertification notice to absent putative class members; it provides only for postcertification notice.  See Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23(c)(2).  There thus is no mechanism for absent putative class members to learn that a putative class action is pending, much less that they are entitled to seek to displace the named plaintiff in that lawsuit as class representative.  Also unlike the PSLRA, Rule 23 contains no process for a district court to choose from among the various candidates for lead plaintiff, nor does it specify what would make a person the most adequate representative of the class.  See 7A C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; M. Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa71765, p.\xc2\xa0321 (3d ed. 2005).

The Advisory Committee notes accompanying the 2003 amendment to Rule 23(c), which changed the recommended timing for a certification determination from \xe2\x80\x9cas soon as practicable\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cat an early practicable time,\xe2\x80\x9d explained that the change would permit time for \xe2\x80\x9ccontrolled discovery into the \xe2\x80\x98merits,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d efforts by defendants \xe2\x80\x9cto win dismissal or summary judgment as to the individual plaintiffs without certification,\xe2\x80\x9d and the considered \xe2\x80\x9cdesignation of class counsel.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advisory Committee\xe2\x80\x99s 2003 Notes on subd. (c)(1)(A) of Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 23, 28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. App., p.\xc2\xa0815.  The notes say nothing about lead-plaintiff selection, and Rule 23(c) in no way ensures that potential lead plaintiffs know about the putative class action or about their opportunity to represent the class.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Given these important differences between Rule 23\xe2\x80\x99s general class procedures and the specific procedures imposed by the PSLRA, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that absent class members were not diligent because they failed to ask to be the class representative in a prior suit makes sense only in the PSLRA context.  The same conclusion simply does not follow in the generic Rule 23 context, where absent class members are most likely unaware of the existence of a putative class action.  Cf. <i>American Pipe</i>, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 551\xe2\x80\x93552 (explaining that even absent class members who are unaware of the putative class action are entitled to tolling).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In addition to its focus on plaintiff diligence, the majority offers a separate line of reasoning to support its broad holding.  It explains that its limitation on <i>American Pipe</i> tolling is necessary to prevent a \xe2\x80\x9climitless\xe2\x80\x9d series of class actions, each rendered timely by the tolling effect of the previous ones.  <i>Ante</i>, at 10.  As the majority acknowledges, however, there is no such risk in this case, see <i>ibid.</i>, because the applicable statute of repose puts a 5-year \xe2\x80\x9couter limit on the right to bring a civil action.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>CTS Corp.</i> v. <i>Waldburger</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 6).  The majority is right, of course, that in many other types of cases, no statute of repose will apply.  See <i>ante,</i> at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  But the Court has elsewhere pointed to the power of \xe2\x80\x9ccomity among courts to mitigate the sometimes substantial costs of similar litigation brought by different plaintiffs.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Bayer Corp.</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 299, 317 (2011).  There is no reason to assume that this existing safeguard will prove inadequate if the Court holds that <i>American Pipe</i> tolling is available for successive class actions outside the PSLRA context.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Even if principles of comity prove insufficient such that some modification to the <i>American Pipe</i> rule is necessary to prevent indefinite tolling, a narrower form of redress is available.  Instead of adopting a blanket no-tolling-of-class-claims-ever rule outside the PSLRA context, the Court might hold, as a matter of equity, that tolling only becomes unavailable for future class claims where class certification is denied for a reason that bears on the suit- ability of the claims for class treatment.  Where, by contrast, class certification is denied because of the deficiencies of the lead plaintiff as class representative, or because of some other nonsubstantive defect, tolling would remain available.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  See <i>Yang</i> v. <i>Odom</i>, 392 F.\xc2\xa03d 97, 112 (CA3 2004).  This approach would, for instance, ensure that in cases where the only problem with the first suit was the identity of the named plaintiff, a new and more adequate representative could file another suit to represent the class.  Preserving the opportunity for such a fix may seem unimportant in a PSLRA case like this one, where the court in the first-filed case will usually have a choice among possible lead plaintiffs.  See <i>ante,</i> at 8\xe2\x80\x939, n.\xc2\xa03.  But, as just explained, in class actions not subject to the PSLRA, the certifying court often will have no choice as to the class representative.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whether this or another rule ultimately is the right one, there is no need for the Court today to reach beyond the facts of this case, where the specter of indefinite tolling is merely hypothetical, and foreclose the possibility of a more tailored approach.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Finally, the majority suggests that its broader approach will encourage multiple potential class representatives to come forward early, which may \xe2\x80\x9caid a district court\xe2\x80\x9d in making class certification decisions.  <i>Ante, </i>at 14.  This may well be so in the PSLRA context, given the statute\xe2\x80\x99s notice requirement and built-in mechanism for selecting the most adequate lead plaintiff.  But in suits not covered by the PSLRA, absent class members may not know of the pending class action early enough to \xe2\x80\x9caid\xe2\x80\x9d the court, and will likely have to file a completely separate lawsuit if what they seek is lead-plaintiff status.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In addition to increasing the number of unnecessary filings, a result at odds with <i>American Pipe</i>\xe2\x80\x99s concern with avoiding \xe2\x80\x9cneedless duplication,\xe2\x80\x9d 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 554, the existence of multiple putative class actions covering the same harm to the same class may lead to a \xe2\x80\x9crace toward judgment or settlement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wasserman, Dueling Class Actions, 80 B.\xc2\xa0U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 461, 472 (2000).  Each class lawyer knows that only the lawyers in the first-resolved case will get paid, because the other suits will then be dismissed on claim-preclusion grounds.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Defense lawyers know this, too, so they are \xe2\x80\x9cable to engage in a \xe2\x80\x98reverse auction,\xe2\x80\x99 pitting the various class counsel against one another and agreeing to settle with the lawyer willing to accept the lowest bid on behalf of the class.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 473.  This gamesmanship is not in class members\xe2\x80\x99 interest, nor in the interest of justice.  I therefore think it unwise to encourage the filing of such dueling class actions outside the PSLRA context.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although there is ample support for denying <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to successive class actions subject to the PSLRA, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning does not justify denying <i>American Pipe </i>tolling to other successive class actions.  The majority could have avoided this error by limiting its decision to the issues presented by the facts of this case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Despite the Court\xe2\x80\x99s misstep in adopting an unnecessarily broad rule, district courts can help mitigate the potential unfairness of denying <i>American Pipe</i> tolling to class claims not subject to the PSLRA.  Where appropriate, district courts should liberally permit amendment of the pleadings or intervention of new plaintiffs and counsel.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Because I agree with the majority\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion just as applied to class actions governed by the PSLRA, like this one, I concur only in the judgment.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0There may, of course, be competition among putative class members to proceed on behalf of the putative class in an action not governed by the PSLRA, and the district court generally considers their relative qualities.  But the point is that the court is not required by Rule 23 to identify and designate as lead plaintiff the person most capable of adequately representing the class; it is only required to determine for certification purposes whether the class representative adequately represents the class.
