But \xe2\x80\x9ca statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833\n (plurality opinion), and \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id</i>., at 878.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">In 2013, the Texas Legislature enacted House Bill 2 (H.\xc2\xa0B. 2), which contains the two provisions challenged here.  The \xe2\x80\x9cadmitting-privileges requirement\xe2\x80\x9d provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cphysician performing or inducing an abortion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must, on the date [of service], have active admitting privileges at a hospital .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. located not further than 30 miles from the\xe2\x80\x9d abortion facility.  The \xe2\x80\x9csurgical-center requirement\xe2\x80\x9d requires an \xe2\x80\x9cabortion facility\xe2\x80\x9d to meet the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum standards .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for ambulatory surgical centers\xe2\x80\x9d under Texas law.  Before the law took effect, a group of Texas abortion providers filed the <i>Abbott</i> case, in which they lost a facial challenge to the constitutionality of the admitting-privileges provision.  After the law went into effect, petitioners, another group of abortion providers (including some <i>Abbott</i> plaintiffs), filed this suit, claiming that both the admitting-privileges and the surgical-center provisions violated the\n \nFourteenth Amendment, as interpreted in <i>Casey</i>.  They sought injunctions preventing enforcement of the admitting-privileges provision as applied to physicians at one abortion facility in McAllen and one in El Paso and prohibiting enforcement of the surgical-center provision throughout Texas.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">Based on the parties\xe2\x80\x99 stipulations, expert depositions, and expert and other trial testimony, the District Court made extensive findings, including, but not limited to: as the admitting-privileges requirement began to be enforced, the number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half, from about 40 to about 20; this decrease in geographical distribution means that the number of women of reproductive age living more than 50 miles from a clinic has doubled, the number living more than 100 miles away has increased by 150%, the number living more than 150 miles away by more than 350%, and the number living more than 200 miles away by about 2,800%; the number of facilities would drop to seven or eight if the surgical-center provision took effect, and those remaining facilities would see a significant increase in patient traffic; facilities would remain only in five metropolitan areas; before H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s passage, abortion was an extremely safe procedure with very low rates of complications and virtually no deaths; it was also safer than many more common procedures not subject to the same level of regulation; and the cost of compliance with the surgical-center requirement would most likely exceed $1.5 million to $3 million per clinic.  The court enjoined enforcement of the provisions, holding that the surgical-center requirement imposed an undue burden on the right of women in Texas to seek previability abortions; that, together with that requirement, the admitting-privileges requirement imposed an undue burden in the Rio Grande Valley, El Paso, and West Texas; and that the provisions together created an \xe2\x80\x9cimpermissible obstacle as applied to all women seeking a previability abortion.\xe2\x80\x9d  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">The Fifth Circuit reversed in significant part.  It concluded that res judicata barred the District Court from holding the admitting-privileges requirement unconstitutional statewide and that res judicata also barred the challenge to the surgical-center provision<i>.  </i>Reasoning that a law is \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional if (1) it does not have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus and (2) it is reasonably related to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a legitimate state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d the court found that both requirements were rationally related to a compelling state interest in protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D"><i>Held:</i></p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional claims are not barred by res judicata.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0Res judicata neither bars petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the admitting-privileges requirement nor prevents the Court from awarding facial relief.  The fact that several petitioners had previously brought the unsuccessful facial challenge in <i>Abbott</i> does not mean that claim preclusion, the relevant aspect of res judicata, applies.  Claim preclusion prohibits \xe2\x80\x9csuccessive litigation of the very same claim,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>New Hampshire</i> v. <i>Maine</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742\n, but petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied postenforcement challenge and the <i>Abbott</i> plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 facial preenforcement challenge do not present the same claim.  Changed circumstances showing that a constitutional harm is concrete may give rise to a new claim.  <i>Abbott</i> rested upon facts and evidence presented before enforcement of the admitting-privileges requirement began, when it was unclear how clinics would be affected.  This case rests upon later, concrete factual developments that occurred once enforcement started and a significant number of clinics closed.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Res judicata also does not preclude facial relief here.  In addition to requesting as-applied relief, petitioners asked for other appropriate relief, and their evidence and arguments convinced the District Court of the provision\xe2\x80\x99s unconstitutionality across the board.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 54(c) provides that a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings,\xe2\x80\x9d and this Court has held that if the arguments and evidence show that a statutory provision is unconstitutional on its face, an injunction prohibiting its enforcement is \xe2\x80\x9cproper,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Citizens United </i>v. <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310\n.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0Claim preclusion also does not bar petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to the surgical-center requirement.  In concluding that petitioners should have raised this claim in <i>Abbott, </i>the Fifth Circuit did not take account of the fact that the surgical-center provision and the admitting-privileges provision are separate provisions with two different and independent regulatory requirements.  Challenges to distinct regulatory requirements are ordinarily treated as distinct claims.  Moreover, the surgical-center provision\xe2\x80\x99s implementing regulations had not even been promulgated at the time <i>Abbott</i> was filed, and the relevant factual circumstances changed between the two suits.  Pp.\xc2\xa016\xe2\x80\x9318.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">2.\xc2\xa0Both the admitting-privileges and the surgical-center requirements place a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking a previability abortion, constitute an undue burden on abortion access, and thus violate the Constitution.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9339.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(a)\xc2\xa0The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s standard of review may be read to imply that a district court should not consider the existence or nonexistence of medical benefits when deciding the undue burden question, but <i>Casey </i>requires courts to consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer, see 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 887\xe2\x80\x93898.  The Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s test also mistakenly equates the judicial review applicable to the regulation of a constitutionally protected personal liberty with the less strict review applicable to, <i>e.g.,</i> economic legislation.  And the court\xe2\x80\x99s requirement that legislatures resolve questions of medical uncertainty is inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law, which has placed considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in judicial proceedings when determining the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion procedures.  See <i>id., </i>at 888\xe2\x80\x93894.  Explicit legislative findings must be considered, but there were no such findings in H.\xc2\xa0B. 2.  The District Court applied the correct legal standard here, considering the evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x94including expert evidence\xe2\x80\x94and then weighing the asserted benefits against the burdens.  Pp.\xc2\xa019\xe2\x80\x9321.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0The record contains adequate legal and factual support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the admitting-privileges requirement imposes an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to choose.  The requirement\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to help ensure that women have easy access to a hospital should complications arise during an abortion procedure, but the District Court, relying on evidence showing extremely low rates of serious complications before H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s passage, found no significant health-related problem for the new law to cure.  The State\xe2\x80\x99s record evidence, in contrast, does not show how the new law advanced the State\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate interest in protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health when compared to the prior law, which required providers to have a \xe2\x80\x9cworking arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d with doctors who had admitting privileges.  At the same time, the record evidence indicates that the requirement places a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d in a woman\xe2\x80\x99s path to abortion.  The dramatic drop in the number of clinics means fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding.  It also means a significant increase in the distance women of reproductive age live from an abortion clinic.  Increased driving distances do not always constitute an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden,\xe2\x80\x9d but they are an additional burden, which, when taken together with others caused by the closings, and when viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit, help support the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion.  Pp.\xc2\xa021\xe2\x80\x9328.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0The surgical-center requirement also provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on their constitutional right to do so.  Before this requirement was enacted, Texas law required abortion facilities to meet a host of health and safety requirements that were policed by inspections and enforced through administrative, civil, and criminal penalties.  Record evidence shows that the new provision imposes a number of additional requirements that are generally unnecessary in the abortion clinic context; that it provides no benefit when complications arise in the context of a medical abortion, which would generally occur after a patient has left the facility; that abortions taking place in abortion facilities are safer than common procedures that occur in outside clinics not subject to Texas\xe2\x80\x99 surgical-center requirements; and that Texas has waived no part of the requirement for any abortion clinics as it has done for nearly two-thirds of other covered facilities.  This evidence, along with the absence of any contrary evidence, supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions, including its ultimate legal conclusion that requirement is not necessary.  At the same time, the record provides adequate evidentiary support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the requirement places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.  The court found that it \xe2\x80\x9cstrained credulity\xe2\x80\x9d to think that the seven or eight abortion facilities would be able to meet the demand.  The Fifth Circuit discounted expert witness Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that the surgical-center requirement would cause the number of abortions performed by each remaining clinic to increase by a factor of about 5.  But an expert may testify in the \xe2\x80\x9cform of an opinion\xe2\x80\x9d as long as that opinion rests upon \xe2\x80\x9csufficient facts or data\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creliable principles and methods.\xe2\x80\x9d  Fed. Rule Evid. 702.  Here, Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion rested upon his participation, together with other university researchers, in research tracking the number of facilities providing abortion services, using information from, among other things, the state health services department and other public sources.  The District Court acted within its legal authority in finding his testimony admissible.  Common sense also suggests that a physical facility that satisfies a certain physical demand will generally be unable to meet five times that demand without expanding physically or otherwise incurring significant costs.  And Texas presented no evidence at trial suggesting that expansion was possible.  Finally, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding that a currently licensed abortion facility would have to incur considerable costs to meet the surgical-center requirements supports the conclusion that more surgical centers will not soon fill the gap left by closed facilities.

In September (before the new law took effect), a group of Texas abortion providers filed an action in Federal District Court seeking facial invalidation ofthe law\xe2\x80\x99s admitting-privileges provision.  In late October, the District Court granted the injunction.  <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. </i>v. <i>Abbott</i>, 951 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 891, 901 (WD Tex. 2013).

In that opinion, the Fifth Circuit pointed to evidence introduced in the District Court the previous October.  It noted that Texas had offered evidence designed to show that the admitting-privileges requirement \xe2\x80\x9cwill reduce the delay in treatment and decrease health risk for abortion patients with critical complications,\xe2\x80\x9d and that it would \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98screen out\xe2\x80\x99 untrained or incompetent abortion providers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex.

Because the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 decision rests upon alternative grounds and fact-related considerations, we set forth its basic reasoning in some detail.  The Court of Appeals concluded:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 The District Court was wrong to hold the admitting-privileges requirement unconstitutional because (except for the clinics in McAllen and El Paso) the providers had not asked them to do so, and principles of res judicata barred relief.  <i>Id.,</i> at 580\xe2\x80\x93583.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Because the providers could have brought their constitutional challenge to the surgical-center provision in their earlier lawsuit, principles of res judicata also barred that claim.  <i>Id.,</i> at 581\xe2\x80\x93583.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 In any event, a state law \xe2\x80\x9cregulating previability abortion is constitutional if: (1) it does not have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus; and (2) it is reasonably related to (or designed to further) a legitimate state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 572.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9c[B]oth the admitting privileges requirement and\xe2\x80\x9d the surgical-center requirement \xe2\x80\x9cwere rationally related to a legitimate state interest,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, \xe2\x80\x9crais[ing] the standard and quality of care for women seeking abortions and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. protect[ing] the health and welfare of women seeking abortions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 584.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 The \xe2\x80\x9c[p]laintiffs\xe2\x80\x9d failed \xe2\x80\x9cto proffer competent evidence contradicting the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s statement of a legitimate purpose.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 585.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he district court erred by substituting its own judgment [as to the provisions\xe2\x80\x99 effects] for that of the legislature, albeit .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the name of the undue burden inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 587.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Holding the provisions unconstitutional on their face is improper because the plaintiffs had failed to show that either of the provisions \xe2\x80\x9cimposes an undue burden on a large fraction of women.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 590.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 The District Court erred in finding that, if the surgical-center requirement takes effect, there will be too few abortion providers in Texas to meet the demand.  That factual determination was based upon the finding of one of plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 expert witnesses (Dr. Grossman) that abortion providers in Texas \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98will not be able to go from providing approximately 14,000 abortions annually, as they currently are, to providing the 60,000 to 70,000 abortions that are done each year in Texas once all\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of the clinics failing to meet the surgical-center requirement \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98are forced to close.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 589\xe2\x80\x93590.  But Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion is (in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 view) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>ipse dixit</i>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98record lacks any actual evidence regarding the current or future capacity of the eight clinics\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d; and there is no \xe2\x80\x9cevidence in the record that\xe2\x80\x9d the providers that currently meet the surgical-center requirement \xe2\x80\x9care operating at full capacity or that they cannot increase capacity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these and related reasons, the Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the admitting-privileges requirement is unconstitutional and its holding that the surgical-center requirement is unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals upheld in part the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s more specific holding that the requirements are unconstitutional as applied to the McAllen facility and Dr. Lynn (a doctor at that facility), but it reversed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that the surgical-center requirement is unconstitutional as applied to the facility in El Paso.  In respect to this last claim, the Court of Appeals said that women in El Paso wishing to have an abortion could use abortion providers in nearby New Mexico.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Before turning to the constitutional question, we must consider the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 procedural grounds for holding that (but for the challenge to the provisions of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 as applied to McAllen and El Paso) petitioners were barred from bringing their constitutional challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Claim Preclusion\xe2\x80\x94Admitting-Privileges Requirement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals held that there could be no facial challenge to the admitting-privileges requirement.  Because several of the petitioners here had previously brought an unsuccessful facial challenge to that requirement (namely, <i>Abbott</i>, 748 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 605;<i> </i>see <i>supra,</i> at 2\xe2\x80\x933), the Court of Appeals thought that \xe2\x80\x9cthe principle of res judicata\xe2\x80\x9d applied.  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 581.  The Court of Appeals also held that res judicata prevented the District Court from granting facial relief to petitioners, concluding that it was improper to \xe2\x80\x9cfacially invalidat[e] the admitting privileges requirement,\xe2\x80\x9d because to do so would \xe2\x80\x9cgran[t] more relief than anyone requested or briefed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 580.  We hold that res judicata neither bars petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the admitting-privileges requirement nor prevents us from awarding facial relief.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For one thing, to the extent that the Court of Appeals concluded that the principle of res judicata bars any facial challenge to the admitting-privileges requirement, see <i>ibid.</i>, the court misconstrued petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.  Petitioners did not bring a facial challenge to the admitting-privileges requirement in this case but instead challenged that requirement as applied to the clinics in McAllen and El Paso.  The question is whether res judicata bars petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 particular as-applied<i> </i>claims.  On this point, the Court of Appeals concluded that res judicata was no bar, see 790 F.\xc2\xa03d<i>,</i> at 592, and we agree.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The doctrine of claim preclusion (the here-relevant aspect of res judicata) prohibits \xe2\x80\x9csuccessive litigation of the very same claim\xe2\x80\x9d by the same parties.  <i>New Hampshire</i> v. <i>Maine</i>,\n\n532 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742,\n748 (2001)\n.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 postenforcement as-applied challenge is not \xe2\x80\x9cthe very same claim\xe2\x80\x9d as their preenforcement facial challenge.  The  Restatement of Judgments notes that development of new material facts can mean that a new case and an otherwise similar previous case do not present the same claim.  See Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa724, Comment <i>f</i> (1980) (\xe2\x80\x9cMaterial operative facts occurring after the decision of an action with respect to the same subject matter may in themselves, or taken in conjunction with the antecedent facts, comprise a transaction which may be made the basis of a second action not precluded by the first\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>id.</i>, \xc2\xa720(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cA valid and final personal judgment for the defendant, which rests on the prematurity of the action or on the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s failure to satisfy a precondition to suit, does not bar another action by the plaintiff instituted after the claim has matured, or the precondition has been satisfied\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>id.,</i> \xc2\xa720, Comment <i>k</i> (discussing relationship of this rule with \xc2\xa724, Comment <i>f\xc2\xa0</i>).  The Courts of Appeals have used similar rules to determine the contours of a new claim for purposes of preclusion.  See, <i>e.g., Morgan</i> v. <i>Covington</i>, 648 F.\xc2\xa03d 172, 178 (CA3 2011) (\xe2\x80\x9c[R]es judicata does not bar claims that are predicated on events that postdate the filing of the initial complaint\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Ellis</i> v. <i>CCA of Tenn. LLC</i>, 650 F.\xc2\xa03d 640, 652 (CA7 2011); <i>Bank of N.\xc2\xa0Y.</i> v. <i>First Millennium, Inc.</i>, 607 F.\xc2\xa03d 905, 919 (CA2 2010); <i>Smith</i> v. <i>Potter</i>, 513 F.\xc2\xa03d 781, 783 (CA7 2008); <i>Rawe</i> v. <i>Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co.</i>, 462 F.\xc2\xa03d 521, 529 (CA6 2006); <i>Manning</i> v. <i>Auburn</i>, 953 F.\xc2\xa02d 1355, 1360 (CA11 1992).  The Restatement adds that, where \xe2\x80\x9cimportant human values\xe2\x80\x94such as the lawfulness of continuing personal disability or restraint\xe2\x80\x94are at stake, even a slight change of circumstances may afford a sufficient basis for concluding that a second action may be brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa724, Comment <i>f</i>; see <i>Bucklew</i> v. <i>Lombardi</i>, 783 F.\xc2\xa03d 1120, 1127 (CA8 2015) (allowing as-applied challenge to exe-cution method to proceed notwithstanding prior facial challenge).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We find this approach persuasive.  Imagine a group of prisoners who claim that they are being forced to drink contaminated water.  These prisoners file suit against the facility where they are incarcerated.  If at first their suit is dismissed because a court does not believe that the harm would be severe enough to be unconstitutional, it would make no sense to prevent the same prisoners from bringing a later suit if time and experience eventually showed that prisoners were dying from contaminated water.  Such circumstances would give rise to a new claim that the prisoners\xe2\x80\x99 treatment violates the Constitution.  Factual developments may show that constitutional harm, which seemed too remote or speculative to afford relief at the time of an earlier suit, was in fact indisputable.  In our view, such changed circumstances will give rise to a new constitutional claim.  This approach is sensible, and it is consistent with our precedent.  See <i>Abie State Bank</i> v. <i>Bryan</i>,\n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n772 (1931)\n (where \xe2\x80\x9csuit was brought immediately upon the enactment of the law,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cdecision sustaining the law cannot be regarded as precluding a subsequent suit for the purpose of testing [its] validity .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the lights of the later actual experience\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <i>Lawlor</i> v. <i>National Screen Service Corp.</i>,\n\n349 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322,\n328 (1955)\n (judgment that \xe2\x80\x9cprecludes recovery on claims arising prior to its entry\xe2\x80\x9d nonetheless \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be given the effect of extinguishing claims which did not even then exist\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Carolene Products Co.</i>,\n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144,\n153 (1938)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he constitutionality of a statute predicated upon the existence of a particular state of facts may be challenged by showing to the court that those facts have ceased to exist\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Nashville, C. &amp; St. L.\xc2\xa0R.\xc2\xa0Co.</i> v. <i>Walters</i>,\n\n294 U.\xc2\xa0S. 405,\n415 (1935)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cA statute valid as to one set of facts may be invalid as to another.

Justice Alito\xe2\x80\x99s dissenting opinion is simply wrong that changed circumstances showing that a challenged law has an unconstitutional effect can never give rise to a new claim.  See <i>post, </i>at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (hereinafter the dissent).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Changed circumstances of this kind are why the claim presented in <i>Abbott</i> is not the same claim as petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim here.  The claims in both <i>Abbott </i>and the present case involve \xe2\x80\x9cimportant human values.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa724, Comment <i>f</i>.  We are concerned with H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ceffect .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on women seeking abortions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post, </i>at 30 (Alito, J., dissenting).  And that effect has changed dramatically since petitioners filed their first lawsuit.  <i>Abbott</i> rested on facts and evidence presented to the District Court in October 2013.  748 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 599, n.\xc2\xa014 (declining to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider any arguments\xe2\x80\x9d based on \xe2\x80\x9cdevelopments since the conclusion of the bench trial\xe2\x80\x9d).  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim in this case rests in significant part upon later, concrete factual developments.  Those developments matter.  The <i>Abbott</i> plaintiffs brought their facial challenge to the admitting-privileges requirement <i>prior to its enforcement</i>\xe2\x80\x94before many abortion clinics had closed and while it was still unclear how many clinics would be affected.  Here, petitioners bring an as-applied challenge to the requirement <i>after its enforcement</i>\xe2\x80\x94and after a large number of clinics have in fact closed.  The postenforcement consequences of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 were unknowable before it went into effect.  The <i>Abbott</i> court itself recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ater as-applied challenges can always deal with subsequent, concrete constitutional issues.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 589.  And the Court of Appeals in this case properly decided that new evidence presented by petitioners had given rise to a new claim and that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied challenges are not precluded.  See 790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 591 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe now know with certainty that the non-[surgical-center] abortion facilities have actually closed and physicians have been unable to obtain admitting privileges after diligent effort\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When individuals claim that a particular statute will produce serious constitutionally relevant adverse consequences before they have occurred\xe2\x80\x94and when the courts doubt their likely occurrence\xe2\x80\x94the factual difference that those adverse consequences <i>have in fact occurred</i> can make all the difference.  Compare the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion in the earlier case, <i>Abbott, supra,</i> at 598 (\xe2\x80\x9cAll of the major Texas cities .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. continue to have multiple clinics where many physicians will have or obtain hospital admitting privileges\xe2\x80\x9d), with the facts found in this case, 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 680 (the two provisions will leave Texas with seven or eight clinics).  The challenge brought in this case and the one in <i>Abbott</i> are not the \xe2\x80\x9cvery same claim,\xe2\x80\x9d and the doctrine of claim preclusion consequently doesnot bar a new challenge to the constitutionality of the admitting-privileges requirement.  <i>New Hampshire</i> v. <i>Maine</i>, 532 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 748.  That the litigants in <i>Abbott </i>did not seek review in this Court, as the dissent suggests they should have done, see <i>post, </i>at 10, does not prevent them from seeking review of new claims that have arisen after <i>Abbott</i> was decided.  In sum, the Restatement, cases from the Courts of Appeals, our own precedent, and simple logic combine to convince us that res judicata does not bar this claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals also concluded that the award of facial <i>relief</i> was precluded by principles of res judicata.  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 581.  The court concluded that the District Court should not have \xe2\x80\x9cgranted more relief than anyone requested or briefed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 580.  But in addition to asking for as-applied relief, petitioners asked for \xe2\x80\x9csuch other and further relief as the Court may deem just, proper, and equitable.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 167.  Their evidence and argu-ments convinced the District Court that the provision was unconstitutional across the board.  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure state that (with an exception not relevant here) a \xe2\x80\x9cfinal judgment should grant the relief to which each party is entitled, even if the party has not demanded that relief in its pleadings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 54(c).  And we have held that, if the arguments and evidence show that a statutory provision is unconstitutional on its face, an injunction prohibiting its enforcement is \xe2\x80\x9cproper.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Citizens United </i>v. <i>Federal Election Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</i>,\n\n558 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310,\n333 (2010)\n; see <i>ibid. </i>(in \xe2\x80\x9cthe exercise of its judicial responsibility\xe2\x80\x9d it may be \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for the Court to consider the facial validity\xe2\x80\x9d of a statute, even though a facial challenge was not brought); cf. Fallon, As-Applied and Facial Challenges and Third-Party Standing, 113 Harv. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1321, 1339 (2000) (\xe2\x80\x9c[O]nce a case is brought, no general categorical line bars a court from making broader pronouncements of invalidity in properly \xe2\x80\x98as-applied\xe2\x80\x99 cases\xe2\x80\x9d).  Nothing prevents this Court from awarding facial relief as the appropriate rem-edy for petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 as-applied claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Claim Preclusion\xe2\x80\x94Surgical-Center Requirement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court of Appeals also held that claim preclusion barred petitioners from contending that the surgical-center requirement is unconstitutional.  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 583.  Although it recognized that petitioners did not bring this claim in <i>Abbott</i>, it believed that they should have done so.  The court explained that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 constitutional challenge to the surgical-center requirement and the chal-lenge to the admitting-privileges requirement mounted in <i>Abbott</i></p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9carise from the same \xe2\x80\x98transactio[n] or series of connected transactions.\xe2\x80\x99 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  The challenges involve the same parties and abortion facilities; the challenges are governed by the same legal standards; the provisions at issue were enacted at the same time as part of the same act; the provisions were motivated by a common purpose; the provisions are administered by the same state officials; and the challenges form a convenient trial unit because they rely on a common nucleus of operative facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 581.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all these reasons, the Court of Appeals held petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenge to H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x99s surgical-center requirement was precluded.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals failed, however, to take account of meaningful differences.  The surgical-center provision and the admitting-privileges provision are separate, distinct provisions of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02.  They set forth two different, independent requirements with different enforcement dates.  This Court has never suggested that challenges to two different statutory provisions that serve two different functions must be brought in a single suit.  And lower courts normally treat challenges to distinct regulatory requirements as \xe2\x80\x9cseparate claims,\xe2\x80\x9d even when they are part of one overarching \xe2\x80\x9c[g]overnment regulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74408, p.\xc2\xa052 (2d ed. 2002, Supp. 2015); see <i>Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s Bogarts</i>, <i>Inc</i>. v. <i>Michigan</i>, 501 F.\xc2\xa03d 644, 650 (CA6 2007).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That approach makes sense.  The opposite approach adopted by the Court of Appeals would require treating every statutory enactment as a single transaction which a given party would only be able to challenge one time, in one lawsuit, in order to avoid the effects of claim preclusion.  Such a rule would encourage a kitchen-sink approach to any litigation challenging the validity of statutes.  That outcome is less than optimal\xe2\x80\x94not only for litigants, but for courts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There are other good reasons why petitioners should not have had to bring their challenge to the surgical-center provision at the same time they brought their first suit.  The statute gave the Texas Department of State Health Services authority to make rules implementing the surgical-center requirement.  H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02, \xc2\xa711(a), App. to Pet. forCert. 201a.  At the time petitioners filed <i>Abbott</i>,<i> </i>that state agency had not yet issued any such rules.  Cf. <i>EPA</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 99,\n104 (1977)\n (<i>per curiam</i>); 13B Wright, <i>supra</i>, \xc2\xa73532.6, at 629 (3d ed. 2008)<i> </i>(most courts will not \xe2\x80\x9cundertake review before rules have been adopted\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</i> v. <i>EPA</i>, 859 F.\xc2\xa02d 156, 204 (CADC 1988).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Further, petitioners might well have expected that those rules when issued would contain provisions grandfathering some then-existing abortion facilities and granting full or partial waivers to others.  After all, more than three quarters of non-abortion-related surgical centers had benefited from that kind of provision.  See 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 680\xe2\x80\x93681 (336 of 433 existing Texas surgical centers have been grandfathered or otherwise enjoy a waiver of some of the surgical-center requirements); see also App. 299\xe2\x80\x93302, 443\xe2\x80\x93447, 468\xe2\x80\x93469.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the relevant factual circumstances changed between <i>Abbott</i> and the present lawsuit, as we previously described.  See <i>supra,</i> at 14\xe2\x80\x9315.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent musters only one counterargument.  According to the dissent, if statutory provisions \xe2\x80\x9cimpos[e] the same kind of burden .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. on the same kind of right\xe2\x80\x9d and have mutually reinforcing effects, \xe2\x80\x9cit is evident that\xe2\x80\x9d they are \xe2\x80\x9cpart of the same transaction\xe2\x80\x9d and must be challenged together.  <i>Post</i>, at 20, 22.  But for the word \xe2\x80\x9cevident,\xe2\x80\x9d the dissent points to no support for this conclusion, and we find it unconvincing.  Statutes are often voluminous, with many related, yet distinct, provisions.  Plaintiffs, in order to preserve their claims, need not challenge each such provision of, say, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002, the National Labor Relations Act, the Clean Water Act, the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996, or the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in their first lawsuit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For all of these reasons, we hold that the petitioners did not have to bring their challenge to the surgical-center provision when they challenged the admitting-privileges provision in <i>Abbott</i>.  We accordingly hold that the doctrine of claim preclusion does not prevent them from bringing that challenge now.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">None of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims are barred by res judicata.  Five experts in civil procedure argued, in a brief supporting petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 request for certiorari, that \xe2\x80\x9cthe panel\xe2\x80\x99s procedural ruling is so clearly incorrect\xe2\x80\x9d that there was no reason to decline review.  Brief for Professor Michael Dorf et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 22.  For all of the reasons described above, we agree that the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 procedural ruling was incorrect.  We consequently proceed to consider the merits of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claims.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Undue Burden\xe2\x80\x94Legal Standard</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We begin with the standard, as described in <i>Casey.  </i>We recognize that the \xe2\x80\x9cState has a legitimate interest in seeing to it that abortion, like any other medical procedure, is performed under circumstances that insure maximum safety for the patient.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113,\n150 (1973)\n.  But, we added, \xe2\x80\x9ca statute which, while furthering [a] valid state interest, has the effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s choice cannot be considered a permissible means of serving its legitimate ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Casey,</i> 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877 (plurality opinion).  Moreover, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]nnecessary health regulations that have the purpose or effect of presenting a substantial obstacle to a woman seeking an abortion impose an undue burden on the right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 878.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals wrote that a state law is \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutional if: (1) it does not have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus; and (2) it is reasonably related to (or designed to further) a legitimate state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 572.  The Court of Appeals went on to hold that \xe2\x80\x9cthe district court erred by substituting its own judgment for that of the legislature\xe2\x80\x9d when it conducted its \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden inquiry,\xe2\x80\x9d in part because \xe2\x80\x9cmedical uncertainty underlying a statute is for resolution by legislatures, not the courts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 587 (citing <i>Gonzales </i>v.<i>Carhart, </i>\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,\n163 (2007)\n).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 articulation of the relevant standard is incorrect.  The first part of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 test may be read to imply that a district court should not consider the existence or nonexistence of medical benefits when considering whether a regulation of abortion constitutes an undue burden.  The rule announced in <i>Casey</i>, however,<i> </i>requires that courts consider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.  See<i> </i>505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 887\xe2\x80\x93898 (opinion of the Court) (performing this balancing with respect to a spousal notification provision); <i>id.,</i> at 899\xe2\x80\x93901 (joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.) (same balancing with respect to a parental notification provision).  And the second part of the test is wrong to equate the judicial review applicable to the regulation of a constitutionally protected personal liberty with the less strict review applicable where, for example, economic legislation is at issue.  See, <i>e.g., Williamson </i>v.<i> Lee Optical of Okla., Inc., </i>\n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483,\n491 (1955)\n.  The Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 approach simply does not match the standard that this Court laid out in <i>Casey</i>, which asks courts to consider whether any burden imposed on abortion access is \xe2\x80\x9cundue.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statement that legislatures, and not courts, must resolve questions of medical uncertainty is also inconsistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law.  Instead, the Court, when determining the constitutionality of laws regulating abortion procedures, has placed considerable weight upon evidence and argument presented in judicial proceedings.  In <i>Casey,</i> for example, we relied heavily on the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings and the research-based submissions of <i>amici</i> in declaring a portion of the law at issue unconstitutional.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 888\xe2\x80\x93894 (opinion of the Court) (discussing evidence related to the prevalence of spousal abuse in determining that a spousal notification provision erected an undue burden to abortion access).  And, in <i>Gonzales</i> the Court, while pointing out that we must review legislative \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinding under a deferential standard,\xe2\x80\x9d added that we must not \xe2\x80\x9cplace dispositive weight\xe2\x80\x9d on those \xe2\x80\x9cfindings.\xe2\x80\x9d  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 165. <i>Gonzales</i> went on to point out that the \xe2\x80\x9c<i>Court retains an independent constitutional duty to review factual findings where constitutional rights are at stake</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).  Although there we upheld a statute regulating abortion, we did not do so solely on the basis of legislative findings explicitly set forth in the statute, noting that \xe2\x80\x9cevidence presented in the District Courts contradicts\xe2\x80\x9d some of the legislative findings.  <i>Id.,</i> at 166.  In these circumstances, we said, \xe2\x80\x9c[u]ncritical deference to Congress\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is inappropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Unlike in <i>Gonzales</i>, the relevant statute here does not set forth any legislative findings.  Rather, one is left to infer that the legislature sought to further a constitutionally acceptable objective (namely, protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health).  <i>Id</i>., at 149\xe2\x80\x93150.  For a district court to give significant weight to evidence in the judicial record in these circumstances is consistent with this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law.  As we shall describe, the District Court did so here.  It did not simply substitute its own judgment for that of the legislature.  It considered the evidence in the record\xe2\x80\x94including expert evidence, presented in stipulations, depositions, and testimony.  It then weighed the asserted benefits against the burdens.  We hold that, in so doing, the District Court applied the correct legal standard.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Undue Burden\xe2\x80\x94Admitting-Privileges Requirement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Turning to the lower courts\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation of the evidence, we first consider the admitting-privileges requirement.  Before the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02, doctors who provided abortions were required to \xe2\x80\x9chave admitting privileges <i>or</i> have a working arrangement with a physician(s) who has admitting privileges at a local hospital in order to ensure the necessary back up for medical complications.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7139.56 (2009) (emphasis added).  The new law changed this requirement by requiring that a \xe2\x80\x9cphysician performing or inducing an abortion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. must, on the date the abortion is performed or induced, have active admitting privileges at a hospital that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is located not further than 30 miles from the location at which the abortion is performed or induced.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7171.0031(a).  The District Court held that the legislative change imposed an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to have an abortion.  We conclude that there is adequate legal and factual support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The purpose of the admitting-privileges requirement is to help ensure that women have easy access to a hospital should complications arise during an abortion procedure.  Brief for Respondents 32\xe2\x80\x9337.  But the District Court found that it brought about no such health-related benefit.  The court found that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he great weight of evidence demonstrates that, before the act\xe2\x80\x99s passage, abortion in Texas was extremely safe with particularly low rates of serious complications and virtually no deaths occurring on account of the procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 684.  Thus, there was no significant health-related problem that the new law helped to cure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The evidence upon which the court based this conclusion included, among other things:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 A collection of at least five peer-reviewed studies on abortion complications in the first trimester, showing that the highest rate of major complications\xe2\x80\x94including those complications requiring hospital admission\xe2\x80\x94was less than one-quarter of 1%.  See App. 269\xe2\x80\x93270.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Figures in three peer-reviewed studies showing that the highest complication rate found for the much rarer second trimester abortion was less than one-half of 1% (0.45% or about 1 out of about 200).  <i>Id.</i>, at 270.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Expert testimony to the effect that complications rarely require hospital admission, much less immediate transfer to a hospital from an outpatient clinic.  <i>Id</i>., at 266\xe2\x80\x93267 (citing a study of complications occurring within six weeks after 54,911 abortions that had been paid for by the fee-for-service California Medicaid Program finding that the incidence of complications was 2.1%, the incidence of complications requiring hospital admission was 0.23%, and that of the 54,911 abortion patients included in the study, only 15 required immediate transfer to the hospital on the day of the abortion).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Expert testimony stating that \xe2\x80\x9cit is extremely unlikely that a patient will experience a serious complication at the clinic that requires emergent hospitalization\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cin the rare case in which [one does], the quality of care that the patient receives is not affected by whether the abortion provider has admitting privileges at the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 381.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Expert testimony stating that in respect to surgical abortion patients who do suffer complications requiring hospitalization, most of these complications occur in the days after the abortion, not on the spot.  See <i>id.,</i> at 382; see also <i>id</i>., at 267.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Expert testimony stating that a delay before the onset of complications is also expected for medical abortions, as \xe2\x80\x9cabortifacient drugs take time to exert their effects, and thus the abortion itself almost always occurs after the patient has left the abortion facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 278.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\xa2 Some experts added that, if a patient needs a hospital in the day or week following her abortion, she will likely seek medical attention at the hospital nearest her home.  See, <i>e.g., id</i>., at 153.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We have found nothing in Texas\xe2\x80\x99 record evidence that shows that, compared to prior law (which required a \xe2\x80\x9cworking arrangement\xe2\x80\x9d with a doctor with admitting privileges), the new law advanced Texas\xe2\x80\x99 legitimate interest in protecting women\xe2\x80\x99s health.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We add that, when directly asked at oral argument whether Texas knew of a single instance in which the new requirement would have helped even one woman obtain better treatment, Texas admitted that there was no evidence in the record of such a case.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 47.  This answer is consistent with the findings of the other Federal District Courts that have considered the health benefits of other States\xe2\x80\x99 similar admitting-privileges laws.  See <i>Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc</i>. v. <i>Van Hollen</i>, 94 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 949, 953 (WD Wis. 2015), aff\xe2\x80\x99d <i>sub nom</i>. <i>Planned Parenthood of Wis., Inc</i>. v. <i>Schimel</i>, 806 F.\xc2\xa03d 908 (CA7 2015); <i>Planned Parenthood Southeast, Inc</i>. v. <i>Strange</i>, 33 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d 1330, 1378 (MD Ala. 2014).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the record evidence indicates that the admitting-privileges requirement places a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle in the path of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s choice.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877 (plurality opinion).  The District Court found, as of the time the admitting-privileges requirement began to be enforced, the number of facilities providing abortions dropped in half, from about 40 to about 20.  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 681.  Eight abortion clinics closed in the months leading up to the requirement\xe2\x80\x99s effective date.  See App. 229\xe2\x80\x93230; cf. Brief for Planned Parenthood Federation of America et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 14 (noting that abortion facilities in Waco, San Angelo, and Midland no longer operate because Planned Parenthood is \xe2\x80\x9cunable to find local physicians in those communities with privileges who are willing to provide abortions due to the size of those communities and the hostility that abortion providers face\xe2\x80\x9d).  Eleven more closed on the day the admitting-privileges requirement took effect.  See<i> </i>App. 229\xe2\x80\x93230; Tr. of Oral Arg. 58.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other evidence helps to explain why the new requirement led to the closure of clinics.  We read that other evidence in light of a brief filed in this Court by the Soci-ety of Hospital Medicine.  That brief describes the undisputed general fact that \xe2\x80\x9chospitals often condition admitting privileges on reaching a certain number of admissions per year.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Society of Hospital Medicine et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 11.  Returning to the District Court record, we note that, in direct testimony, the president of Nova Health Systems, implicitly relying on this general fact, pointed out that it would be difficult for doctors regularly performing abortions at the El Paso clinic to obtain admitting privileges at nearby hospitals because \xe2\x80\x9c[d]uring the past 10 years, over 17,000 abortion procedures were performed at the El Paso clinic [and n]ot a single one of those patients had to be transferred to a hospital for emergency treatment, much less admitted to the hospital.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 730.  In a word, doctors would be unable to maintain admitting privileges or obtain those privileges for the future, because the fact that abortions are so safe meant that providers were unlikely to have any patients to admit.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Other <i>amicus</i> briefs filed here set forth without dispute other common prerequisites to obtaining admitting privileges that have nothing to do with ability to perform medical procedures.  See Brief for Medical Staff Professionals as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 20\xe2\x80\x9325 (listing, for example, requirements that an applicant has treated a high number of patients in the hospital setting in the past year, clinical data requirements, residency requirements, and other discretionary factors); see also Brief for American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists et\xc2\xa0al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 16 (ACOG Brief) (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]ome academic hospitals will only allow medical staff membership for clinicians who also .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. accept faculty appointments\xe2\x80\x9d).  Again, returning to the District Court record, we note that Dr. Lynn of the McAllen clinic, a veteran obstetrics and gynecology doctor who estimates that he has delivered over 15,000 babies in his 38 years in practice was unable to get admitting privileges at any of the seven hospitals within 30 miles of his clinic.

He was refused admitting privileges at a nearby hospital for reasons, as the hospital wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cnot based on clinical competence considerations.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 393\xe2\x80\x93394 (emphasis deleted).  The admitting-privileges requirement does not serve any relevant credentialing function.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In our view, the record contains sufficient evidence that the admitting-privileges requirement led to the closure of half of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 clinics, or thereabouts.  Those closures meant fewer doctors, longer waiting times, and increased crowding.  Record evidence also supports the finding that after the admitting-privileges provision went into effect, the \xe2\x80\x9cnumber of women of reproductive age living in a county .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. more than 150 miles from a provider increased from approximately 86,000 to 400,000 .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and the number of women living in a county more than 200 miles from a provider from approximately 10,000 to 290,000.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 681.  We recognize that increased driving distances do not always constitute an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 885\xe2\x80\x93887 (joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  But here, those increases are but one additional burden, which, when taken together with others that the closings brought about, and when viewed in light of the virtual absence of any health benefit, lead us to conclude that the record adequately supports the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d conclusion.  Cf. <i>id.,</i> at 895<i> </i>(opinion of the Court) (finding burden \xe2\x80\x9cundue\xe2\x80\x9d when requirement places \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle to a woman\xe2\x80\x99s choice\xe2\x80\x9d in \xe2\x80\x9ca large fraction of the cases in which\xe2\x80\x9d it \xe2\x80\x9cis relevant\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s only argument why these clinic closures, as well as the ones discussed in Part V, <i>infra</i>, may not have imposed an undue burden is this: Although \xe2\x80\x9cH.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 caused the closure of <i>some</i> clinics,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 26 (emphasis added), other clinics may have closed for other reasons (so we should not \xe2\x80\x9cactually count\xe2\x80\x9d the burdens resulting from those closures against H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02), <i>post</i>, at 30\xe2\x80\x9331.  But petitioners satisfied their burden to present evidence of causation by presenting direct testimony as well as plausible inferences to be drawn from the timing of the clinic closures.  App. 182\xe2\x80\x93183, 228\xe2\x80\x93231.  The District Court credited that evidence and concluded from it that H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 in factled to the clinic closures.  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 680\xe2\x80\x93681.  The dissent\xe2\x80\x99s speculation that perhaps other evidence, not presented at trial or credited by the District Court, might have shown that some clinics closed for unrelated reasons does not provide sufficient ground to disturb the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding on that issue.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the same breath, the dissent suggests that one benefit of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x99s requirements would be that they might \xe2\x80\x9cforce unsafe facilities to shut down.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Post</i>, at 26.  To support that assertion, the dissent points to the Kermit Gosnell scandal.  Gosnell, a physician in Pennsylvania, was convicted of first-degree murder and manslaughter.  He \xe2\x80\x9cstaffed his facility with unlicensed and indifferent workers, and then let them practice medicine unsupervised\xe2\x80\x9d and had \xe2\x80\x9c[d]irty facilities; unsanitary instruments; an absence of functioning monitoring and resuscitation equipment; the use of cheap, but dangerous, drugs; illegal procedures; and inadequate emergency access for when things inevitably went wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  Report of Grand Juryin No. 0009901\xe2\x80\x932008 (1st Jud. Dist. Pa., Jan. 14,2011), p.\xc2\xa024, online at http://www.phila.gov/districtattorney/pdfs/grandjurywomensmedical.pdf (as last visited June 24, 2016).  Gosnell\xe2\x80\x99s behavior was terribly wrong.  But there is no reason to believe that an extra layerof regulation would have affected that behavior.  Deter-mined wrongdoers, already ignoring existing stat-utes and safety measures, are unlikely to be convinced to adopt safe practices by a new overlay of regulations.  Regardless, Gosnell\xe2\x80\x99s deplorable crimes could escape detection only because his facility went uninspected for more than 15 years.  <i>Id.</i>, at 20.  Pre-existing Texas law already contained numerous detailed regulations covering abortion facilities, including a requirement that facilities be inspected at least annually.  See <i>infra</i>, at 28 (describing those regulations).  The record contains nothing to suggest that H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 would be more effective than pre-existing Texas law at deterring wrongdoers like Gosnell from criminal behavior.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-H2"><i>Undue Burden\xe2\x80\x94Surgical-Center Requirement</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The second challenged provision of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 new law sets forth the surgical-center requirement.  Prior to enactment of the new requirement, Texas law required abortion facilities to meet a host of health and safety requirements.  Under those pre-existing laws, facilities were subject to annual reporting and recordkeeping requirements, see Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7139.4, 139.5, 139.55, 139.58; a quality assurance program, see \xc2\xa7139.8; personnel policies and staffing requirements, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7139.43, 139.46; physical and environmental requirements, see \xc2\xa7139.48; infection control standards, see \xc2\xa7139.49; disclosure requirements, see \xc2\xa7139.50; patient-rights standards, see \xc2\xa7139.51; and medical- and clinical-services standards, see \xc2\xa7139.53, including anesthesia standards, see \xc2\xa7139.59. These requirements are policed by random and announced inspections, at least annually, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7139.23, 139.31; Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7245.006(a) (West 2010), as well as administrative penalties, injunctions, civil penalties,and criminal penalties for certain violations, see Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7139.33; Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7245.011 (criminal penalties for certain reporting violations).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 added the requirement that an \xe2\x80\x9cabortion facility\xe2\x80\x9d meet the \xe2\x80\x9cminimum standards .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for ambulatory surgical centers\xe2\x80\x9d under Texas law.  \xc2\xa7245.010(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2015).  The surgical-center regulations include, among other things, detailed specifications relating to the size of the nursing staff, building dimensions, and other building requirements.  The nursing staff must comprise at least \xe2\x80\x9can adequate number of [registered nurses] on duty to meet the following minimum staff requirements: director of the department (or designee), and supervisory and staff personnel for each service area to assure the immediate availability of [a registered nurse] for emergency care or for any patient when needed,\xe2\x80\x9d Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7135.15(a)(3) (2016), as well as \xe2\x80\x9ca second individual on duty on the premises who is trained and currently certified in basic cardiac life support until all patients have been discharged from the facility\xe2\x80\x9d for facilities that provide moderate sedation, such as most abortion facilities, \xc2\xa7135.15(b)(2)(A).  Facilities must include a full surgical suite with an operating room that has \xe2\x80\x9ca clear floor area of at least 240 square feet\xe2\x80\x9d in which \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he minimum clear dimension between built-in cabinets, counters, and shelves shall be 14 feet.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7135.52(d)(15)(A).  There must be a preoperative patient holding room and a postoperative recovery suite.  The former \xe2\x80\x9cshall be provided and arranged in a one-way traffic pattern so that patients entering from outside the surgical suite can change, gown, and move directly into the restricted corridor of the surgical suite,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7135.52(d)(10)(A), and the latter \xe2\x80\x9cshall be arranged to provide a one-way traffic pattern from the restricted surgical corridor to the postoperative recovery suite, and then to the extended observation rooms or discharge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7135.52(d)(9)(A).  Surgical centers must meet numerous other spatial requirements, see generally \xc2\xa7135.52, including specific corridor widths, \xc2\xa7135.52(e)(1)(B)(iii).  Surgical centers must also have an advanced heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system, \xc2\xa7135.52(g)(5), and must satisfy particular piping system and plumbing requirements, \xc2\xa7135.52(h).  Dozens of other sections list additional requirements that apply to surgical centers.  See generally \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7135.1\xe2\x80\x93135.56.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">There is considerable evidence in the record supporting the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s findings indicating that the statutory provision requiring all abortion facilities to meet all surgical-center standards does not benefit patients and is not necessary.  The District Court found that \xe2\x80\x9crisks are not appreciably lowered for patients who undergo abortions at ambulatory surgical centers as compared to nonsurgical-center facilities.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 684.  The court added that women \xe2\x80\x9cwill not obtain better care or experience more frequent positive outcomes at an ambulatory surgical center as compared to a previously licensed facility.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And these findings are well supported.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The record makes clear that the surgical-center requirement provides no benefit when complications arise in the context of an abortion produced through medication. That is because, in such a case, complications would almost always arise only after the patient has left the facil-ity.  See <i>supra</i>, at 23; App. 278.  The record also contains evidence indicating that abortions taking place in an abortion facility are safe\xe2\x80\x94indeed, safer than numerous procedures that take place outside hospitals and to which Texas does not apply its surgical-center requirements.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>id.,</i> at 223\xe2\x80\x93224, 254, 275\xe2\x80\x93279.  The total number of deaths in Texas from abortions was five in the period from 2001 to 2012, or about one every two years (that is to say, one out of about 120,000 to 144,000 abortions).  <i>Id.,</i> at 272.  Nationwide, childbirth is 14 times more likely than abortion to result in death, <i>ibid.</i>, but Texas law allows a midwife to oversee childbirth in the patient\xe2\x80\x99s own home.  Colonoscopy, a procedure that typically takes place outside a hospital (or surgical center) setting, has a mortality rate 10 times higher than an abortion.  <i>Id</i>., at 276\xe2\x80\x93277; see ACOG Brief 15 (the mortality rate for liposuction, another outpatient procedure, is 28 times higher than the mortal-ity rate for abortion).  Medical treatment after an incomplete miscarriage often involves a procedure identical to that involved in a nonmedical abortion, but it often takes place outside a hospital or surgical center.  App. 254; see ACOG Brief 14 (same).  And Texas partly or wholly grandfathers (or waives in whole or in part the surgical-center requirement for) about two-thirds of the facilities to which the surgical-center standards apply.  But it neither grandfathers nor provides waivers for any of the facilities that perform abortions.  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 680\xe2\x80\x93681; see App. 184.  These facts indicate that the surgical-center provision imposes \xe2\x80\x9ca requirement that simply is not based on differences\xe2\x80\x9d between abortion and other surgical procedures \xe2\x80\x9cthat are reasonably related to\xe2\x80\x9d preserving women\xe2\x80\x99s health, the asserted \xe2\x80\x9cpurpos[e] of the Act in which it is found.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Doe</i>, 410 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 194 (quoting <i>Morey</i> v. <i>Doud</i>,\n\n354 U.\xc2\xa0S. 457,\n465 (1957)\n; internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, many surgical-center requirements are inappropriate as applied to surgical<i> </i>abortions.  Requiring scrub facilities; maintaining a one-way traffic pattern through the facility; having ceiling, wall, and floor fin-ishes; separating soiled utility and sterilization rooms; and regulating air pressure, filtration, and humidity control can help reduce infection where doctors conduct procedures that penetrate the skin.  App. 304.  But abortions typically involve either the administration of medicines or procedures performed through the natural opening of the birth canal, which is itself not sterile.  See <i>id</i>., at 302\xe2\x80\x93303.  Nor do provisions designed to safeguard heavily sedated patients (unable to help themselves) during fire emergencies, see Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7135.41; App. 304, provide any help to abortion patients, as abortion facilities do not use general anesthesia or deep sedation, <i>id.,</i> at 304\xe2\x80\x93305.  Further, since the few instances in which serious complications do arise following an abortion almost always require hospitalization, not treatment at a surgical center, <i>id</i>., at 255\xe2\x80\x93256, surgical-center standards will not help in those instances either.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The upshot is that this record evidence, along with the absence of any evidence to the contrary, provides ample support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]any of the building standards mandated by the act and its implementing rules have such a tangential relationship to patient safety in the context of abortion as to be nearly arbitrary.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 684.  That conclusion, along with the supporting evidence, provides sufficient support for the more general conclusion that the surgical-center requirement \xe2\x80\x9cwill not [provide] better care or .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. more frequent positive outcomes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  The record evidence thus supports the ultimate legal conclusion that thesurgical-center requirement is not necessary.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At the same time, the record provides adequate evidentiary support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that the surgical-center requirement places a substantial obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.  The parties stipulated that the requirement would further reduce the number of abortion facilities available to seven or eight facilities, located in Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and Dallas/Fort Worth.  See App. 182\xe2\x80\x93183.  In the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s view, the proposition that these \xe2\x80\x9cseven or eight providers could meet the demand of the entire State stretches credulity.\xe2\x80\x9d  46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 682.  We take this statement as a finding that these few facilities could not \xe2\x80\x9cmeet\xe2\x80\x9d that \xe2\x80\x9cdemand.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court of Appeals held that this finding was \xe2\x80\x9cclearly erroneous.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 590.  It wrote that the finding rested upon the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<i>ipse dixit</i>\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of one expert, Dr. Grossman, and that there was no evidence that the current surgical centers (<i>i.e., </i>the seven or eight) are operating at full capacity or could not increase capacity.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Unlike the Court of Appeals, however, we hold that the record provides adequate support for the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s finding.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For one thing, the record contains charts and oral testimony by Dr. Grossman, who said that, as a result of the surgical-center requirement, the number of abortions that the clinics would have to provide would rise from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9814,000 abortions annually\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9860,000 to 70,000\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94an increase by a factor of about five.  <i>Id.,</i> at 589\xe2\x80\x93590.  The District Court credited Dr. Grossman as an expert witness.  See 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 678\xe2\x80\x93679, n.\xc2\xa01; <i>id.,</i> at 681, n.\xc2\xa04 (finding \xe2\x80\x9cindicia of reliability\xe2\x80\x9d in Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s conclusions).  The Federal Rules of Evidence state that an expert may testify in the \xe2\x80\x9cform of an opinion\xe2\x80\x9d as long as that opinion rests upon \xe2\x80\x9csufficient facts or data\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9creliable principles and methods.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 702<i>.</i>  In this case Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s opinion rested upon his participation, along with other university researchers, in research that tracked \xe2\x80\x9cthe number of open facilities providing abortion care in the state by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. requesting information from the Texas Department of State Health Services .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [, t]hrough interviews with clinic staff[,] and review of publicly available information.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 227.  The District Court acted within its legal authority in determining that Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was admissible.  See Fed. Rule Evid. 702; see also <i>Daubert </i>v. <i>Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</i>,\n\n509 U.\xc2\xa0S. 579,\n589 (1993)\n (\xe2\x80\x9c[U]nder the Rules the trial judge must ensure that any and all [expert] evidence admitted is not only relevant, but reliable\xe2\x80\x9d); 29 C. Wright &amp; V. Gold, Federal Practice and Procedure: Evidence \xc2\xa76266, p. 302 (2016) (\xe2\x80\x9cRule 702 impose[s] on the trial judge additional responsibility to determine whether that [expert] testimony is likely to promote accurate factfinding\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For another thing, common sense suggests that, more often than not, a physical facility that satisfies a certain physical demand will not be able to meet five times that demand without expanding or otherwise incurring significant costs.  Suppose that we know only that a certain grocery store serves 200 customers per week, that a certain apartment building provides apartments for 200 families, that a certain train station welcomes 200 trains per day.  While it is conceivable that the store, the apartment building, or the train station could just as easily provide for 1,000 customers, families, or trains at no significant additional cost, crowding, or delay, most of us would find this possibility highly improbable.  The dissent takes issue with this general, intuitive point by arguing that many places operate below capacity and that in any event, facilities could simply hire additional providers.  See <i>post,</i> at 32.  We disagree that, according to common sense, medical facilities, well known for their wait times, operate below capacity as a general matter.  And the fact that so many facilities were forced to close by the admitting-privileges requirement means that hiring more physi-cians would not be quite as simple as the dissent suggests.  Courts are free to base their findings on commonsense inferences drawn from the evidence.  And that is what the District Court did here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The dissent now seeks to discredit Dr. Grossman by pointing out that a preliminary prediction he made in his testimony in <i>Abbott</i> about the effect of the admitting-privileges requirement on capacity was not borne out after that provision went into effect.  See <i>post,</i> at 31, n.\xc2\xa022.  If every expert who overestimated or underestimated any figure could not be credited, courts would struggle to find expert assistance.  Moreover, making a hypothesis\xe2\x80\x94and then attempting to verify that hypothesis with further studies, as Dr. Grossman did\xe2\x80\x94is not irresponsible.  It is an essential element of the scientific method.  The District Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision to credit Dr. Grossman\xe2\x80\x99s testimony was sound, particularly given that Texas provided no credible experts to rebut it.  See 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d, at 680, n.\xc2\xa03 (declining to credit Texas\xe2\x80\x99 expert witnesses, in part because Vincent Rue, a nonphysician consultant for Texas, had exercised \xe2\x80\x9cconsiderable editorial and discretionary control over the contents of the experts\xe2\x80\x99 reports\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Texas suggests that the seven or eight remaining clinics could expand sufficiently to provide abortions for the 60,000 to 72,000 Texas women who sought them each year.  Because petitioners had satisfied their burden, the obligation was on Texas, if it could, to present evidence rebutting that issue to the District Court.  Texas admitted that it presented no such evidence.  Tr. of Oral Arg. 46.  Instead, Texas argued before this Court that one new clinic now serves 9,000 women annually.  <i>Ibid.</i>  In addition to being outside the record, that example is not representative.  The clinic to which Texas referred apparently cost $26 million to construct\xe2\x80\x94a fact that even more clearly demonstrates that requiring seven or eight clinics to serve five times their usual number of patients does indeed represent an undue burden on abortion access.  See Planned Parenthood Debuts New Building: Its $26 Million Center in Houston is Largest of Its Kind in U.\xc2\xa0S<i>.</i>, Houston Chronicle, May 21, 2010, p. B1.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Attempting to provide the evidence that Texas did not, the dissent points to an exhibit submitted in <i>Abbott</i> showing that three Texas surgical centers, two in Dallas as well as the $26-million facility in Houston, are each capable of serving an average of 7,000 patients per year.  See <i>post,</i> at 33\xe2\x80\x9335.  That \xe2\x80\x9caverage\xe2\x80\x9d is misleading.  In addition to including the Houston clinic, which does not represent most facilities, it is underinclusive.  It ignores the evidence as to the Whole Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Health surgical-center facility in San Antonio, the capacity of which is described as \xe2\x80\x9cseverely limited.\xe2\x80\x9d   The exhibit does nothing to rebut the commonsense inference that the dramatic decline in the number of available facilities will cause a shortfall in capacity should H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 go into effect.  And facilities that were still operating after the effective date of the admitting-privileges provision were not able to accommodate increased demand.  See App. 238; Tr. of Oral Arg. 30\xe2\x80\x9331; Brief for National Abortion Federation et al. as <i>Amici Curiae</i> 17\xe2\x80\x9320 (citing clinics\xe2\x80\x99 experiences since theadmitting-privileges requirement went into effect of 3-week wait times, staff burnout, and waiting rooms so full, patients had to sit on the floor or wait outside).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">More fundamentally, in the face of no threat to women\xe2\x80\x99s health, Texas seeks to force women to travel long distances to get abortions in crammed-to-capacity superfacilities.  Patients seeking these services are less likely to get the kind of individualized attention, serious conversation, and emotional support that doctors at less taxed facilities may have offered.  Healthcare facilities and medical professionals are not fungible commodities.  Surgical centers attempting to accommodate sudden, vastly increased demand, see 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa03d, at 682, may find that quality of care declines.  Another commonsense inference that the District Court made is that these effects would be harmful to, not supportive of, women\xe2\x80\x99s health.  See <i>id.,</i> at 682\xe2\x80\x93683.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the District Court found that the costs that a currently licensed abortion facility would have to incur to meet the surgical-center requirements were considerable, ranging from $1 million per facility (for facilities with adequate space) to $3 million per facility (where additional land must be purchased).  <i>Id</i>., at 682.  This evidence supports the conclusion that more surgical centers will not soon fill the gap when licensed facilities are forced to close.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We agree with the District Court that the surgical-center requirement, like the admitting-privileges requirement, provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on their constitutional right to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">VI</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We consider three additional arguments that Texas makes and deem none persuasive.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">First, Texas argues that facial invalidation of both challenged provisions is precluded by H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02\xe2\x80\x99s severability clause.  See Brief for Respondents 50\xe2\x80\x9352.  The severability clause says that \xe2\x80\x9cevery provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Act, and every application of the provision in this Act, are severable from each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02, \xc2\xa710(b), App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.  It further provides that if \xe2\x80\x9cany application of any provision in this Act to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid, the remaining applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and may not be affected.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  That language, Texas argues, means that facial invalidation of parts of the statute is not an option; instead, it says, the severability clause mandates a more narrowly tailored judicial remedy.  But the challenged provisions of H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 close most of the abortion facilities in Texas and place added stress on those facilities able to remain open.  They vastly increase the obstacles confronting women seeking abortions in Texas without providing any benefit to women\xe2\x80\x99s health capable of withstanding any meaningful scrutiny.  The provisions are unconstitutional on their face: Including a severability provision in the law does not change that conclusion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Severability clauses, it is true, do express the enacting legislature\xe2\x80\x99s preference for a narrow judicial remedy.  As a general matter, we attempt to honor that preference.  But our cases have never required us to proceed application by conceivable application when confronted with a facially unconstitutional statutory provision.  \xe2\x80\x9cWe have held that a severability clause is an aid merely; not an inexorable command.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 844\n\xe2\x80\x93885, n.\xc2\xa049 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted).  Indeed, if a severability clause could impose such a requirement on courts, legislatures would easily be able to insulate unconstitutional statutes from most facial review.  See <i>ibid.</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cIt would certainly be dangerous if the legislature could set a net large enough to catch all possible offenders, and leave it to the courts to step inside and say who could be rightfully detained, and who should be set at large.  This would, to some extent, substitute the judicial for the legislative department of the government\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  A severability clause is not grounds for a court to \xe2\x80\x9cdevise a judicial remedy that . . . entail[s] quintessentially legislative work.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ayotte</i> v. <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n329 (2006)\n.  Such an approach would inflict enormous costs on both courts and litigants, who would be required to proceed in this manner whenever a single application of a law might be valid.  We reject Texas\xe2\x80\x99 invitation to pave the way for legislatures to immunize their statutes from facial review.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Texas similarly argues that instead of finding the entire surgical-center provision unconstitutional, we should invalidate (as applied to abortion clinics) only those spe-cific surgical-center regulations that unduly burden the pro-vision of abortions, while leaving in place other surgical-center regulations (for example, the reader could pickany of the various examples provided by the dissent, see <i>post, </i>at 42\xe2\x80\x9343).  See Brief for Respondents 52\xe2\x80\x9353.  As we have explained, Texas\xe2\x80\x99 attempt to broadly draft a requirement to sever \xe2\x80\x9capplications\xe2\x80\x9d does not require us to proceed in piecemeal fashion when we have found the statutory provisions at issue facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Nor is that approach to the regulations even required by H.\xc2\xa0B.\xc2\xa02 itself.  The statute was meant to require abortion facilities to meet the integrated surgical-center standards\xe2\x80\x94not some subset thereof.  The severability clause refers to severing applications of words and phrases <i>in the Act</i>, such as the surgical-center requirement as a whole.  See H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, \xc2\xa74, App. to Pet. for Cert. 194a.  It does not say that courts should go through the individual components of the different, surgical-center statute, let alone the individual <i>regulations</i> governing surgical centers to see whether those requirements are severable from each other as applied to abortion facilities.  Facilities subject to some subset of those regulations do not qualify as surgical centers.  And the risk of harm caused by inconsistent application of only a fraction of interconnected regulations counsels against doing so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, Texas claims that the provisions at issue here do not impose a substantial obstacle because the women affected by those laws are not a \xe2\x80\x9clarge fraction\xe2\x80\x9d of Texan women \xe2\x80\x9cof reproductive age,\xe2\x80\x9d which Texas reads <i>Casey</i> to have required.  See Brief for Respondents 45, 48.  But <i>Casey</i> used the language \xe2\x80\x9clarge fraction\xe2\x80\x9d to refer to \xe2\x80\x9ca large fraction of cases in which [the provision at issue] is <i>relevant</i>,\xe2\x80\x9d a class narrower than \xe2\x80\x9call women,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpregnant women,\xe2\x80\x9d or even \xe2\x80\x9cthe class of <i>women seeking abortions</i> identified by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 894\xe2\x80\x93895 (opinion of the Court) (emphasis added).  Here, as in <i>Casey</i>, the relevant denominator is \xe2\x80\x9cthose [women] for whom [the provision] is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 895.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Third, Texas looks for support to <i>Simopoulos</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 506 (1983)\n, a case in which this Court uphelda surgical-center requirement as applied to second-trimester abortions.  This case, however, unlike <i>Simopoulos, </i>involves restrictions applicable to all abortions, not simply to those that take place during the second trimester.  Most abortions in Texas occur in the first trimester, not the second.  App. 236.  More importantly, in <i>Casey</i> we discarded the trimester framework, and we now use \xe2\x80\x9cviability\xe2\x80\x9d as the relevant point at which a State may begin limiting women\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion for reasons unrelated to maternal health.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 878 (plurality opinion).  Because the second trimester includes time that is both previability and postviability, <i>Simopoulos</i> cannot provide clear guidance.  Further, the Court in <i>Simopoulos </i>found that the petitioner in that case, unlike petitioners here, had waived any argument that the regulation did not significantly help protect women\xe2\x80\x99s health.  462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 517.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons the judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">It is so ordered.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-3590955">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">No. 15\xe2\x80\x93274</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">_________________</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">WHOLE WOMAN\xe2\x80\x99S HEALTH, et\xc2\xa0al., PETITIONERS <i>v.</i> JOHN HELLERSTEDT, COMMISSIONER, TEXAS DEPARTMENT OF STATE HEALTH SERVICES, et\xc2\xa0al.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-B">on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the fifth circuit</p>\n<p style="p-DateCode">[June 27, 2016]</p>\n<p style="p-Normal"></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-A">Justice Ginsburg, concurring.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Texas law called H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 inevitably will reduce the number of clinics and doctors allowed to provide abortion services.

That decision exemplifies the Court\xe2\x80\x99s troubling tendency \xe2\x80\x9cto bend the rules when any effort to limit abortion, or even to speak in opposition to abortion, is at issue.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Stenberg</i> v. <i>Carhart</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 914,\n954 (2000)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  As Justice Alito observes, see <i>post </i>(dissenting opinion), today\xe2\x80\x99s decision creates an abortion exception to ordinary rules of res judicata, ignores compelling evidence that Texas\xe2\x80\x99 law imposes no unconstitutional burden, and disregards basic principles of the severability doctrine.  I write separately to emphasize how today\xe2\x80\x99s decision perpetuates the Court\xe2\x80\x99s habit of apply-ing different rules to different constitutional rights\xe2\x80\x94especially the putative right to abortion.</p>\n<p>To begin, the very existence of this suit is a jurisprudential oddity.  Ordinarily, plaintiffs cannot file suits to vindicate the constitutional rights of others.  But the Court employs a different approach to rights that it favors.  So in this case and many others, the Court has erroneously allowed doctors and clinics to vicariously vindicate the putative constitutional right of women seeking abortions.</p>\n<p>This case also underscores the Court\xe2\x80\x99s increasingly common practice of invoking a given level of scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94here, the abortion-specific undue burden standard\xe2\x80\x94while applying a different standard of review entirely.  What-ever scrutiny the majority applies to Texas\xe2\x80\x99 law, it bears little resemblance to the undue-burden test the Court articulated in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833 (1992)\n, and its successors.  Instead, the majority eviscerates important features of that test to return to a regime like the one that <i>Casey </i>repudiated.</p>\n<p>Ultimately, this case shows why the Court never should have bent the rules for favored rights in the first place.  Our law is now so riddled with special exceptions for special rights that our decisions deliver neither predict-ability nor the promise of a judiciary bound by the rule of law.</p>\n<p>I</p>\n<p>This suit is possible only because the Court has allowed abortion clinics and physicians to invoke a putative constitutional right that does not belong to them\xe2\x80\x94a woman\xe2\x80\x99s right to abortion.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s third-party standing jurisprudence is no model of clarity.  See <i>Kowalski</i> v. <i>Tesmer</i>,\n\n543 U.\xc2\xa0S. 125,\n135 (2004)\n (Thomas, J., concurring).  Driving this doctrinal confusion, the Court has shown a particular willingness to undercut restrictions on third-party standing when the right to abortion is at stake.  And this case reveals a deeper flaw in straying from our normal rules: when the wrong party litigates a case, we end up resolving disputes that make for bad law.</p>\n<p>For most of our Nation\xe2\x80\x99s history, plaintiffs could not challenge a statute by asserting someone else\xe2\x80\x99s constitutional rights.  See <i>ibid.</i>  This Court would \xe2\x80\x9cnot listen to an objection made to the constitutionality of an act by a party whose rights it does not affect and who has therefore no interest in defeating it.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Clark </i>v. <i>Kansas City</i>,\n\n176 U.\xc2\xa0S. 114,\n118 (1900)\n (internal quotation marks omitted).  And for good reason: \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ourts are not roving commissions assigned to pass judgment on the validity of the Nation\xe2\x80\x99s laws.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Broadrick </i>v. <i>Oklahoma</i>,\n\n413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 601\n\xe2\x80\x93611 (1973).</p>\n<p>In the 20th century, the Court began relaxing that rule.  But even as the Court started to recognize exceptions for certain types of challenges, it stressed the strict limits of those exceptions.  A plaintiff could assert a third party\xe2\x80\x99s rights, the Court said, but only if the plaintiff had a \xe2\x80\x9cclose relation to the third party\xe2\x80\x9d and the third party faced a formidable \xe2\x80\x9chindrance\xe2\x80\x9d to asserting his own rights.  <i>Powers </i>v.<i> Ohio</i>,\n\n499 U.\xc2\xa0S. 400,\n411 (1991)\n; accord, <i>Kowalski</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 130\xe2\x80\x93133 (similar).</p>\n<p>Those limits broke down, however, because the Court has been \xe2\x80\x9cquite forgiving\xe2\x80\x9d in applying these standards to certain claims.  <i>Id.</i>, at 130.  Some constitutional rights remained \xe2\x80\x9cpersonal rights which .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may not be vicari-ously asserted.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Alderman </i>v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n394 U.\xc2\xa0S. 165,\n174 (1969)\n (\n \nFourth Amendment rights are purely per-sonal); see <i>Rakas </i>v. <i>Illinois</i>,\n\n439 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128,\n140, n.\n8 (1978)\n (so is the\n \nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination).  But the Court has abandoned such limitations on other rights, producing serious anomalies across similar factual scenarios.  Lawyers cannot vicariously assert potential clients\xe2\x80\x99\n \nSixth Amendment rights because they lack any current, close relationship.  <i>Kowalski, supra,</i> at 130\xe2\x80\x93131.  Yet litigants can assert potential jurors\xe2\x80\x99 rights against race or sex discrimination in jury selection even when the litigants have never met potential jurors and do not share their race or sex.  <i>Powers</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 410\xe2\x80\x93416; <i>J. E. B.</i> v. <i>Alabama ex rel. T.</i>\xc2\xa0<i>B.</i>,\n\n511 U.\xc2\xa0S. 127,\n129 (1994)\n.  And vendors can sue to invalidate state regulations implicating potential customers\xe2\x80\x99 equal protection rights against sex discrimination.  <i>Craig</i> v. <i>Boren</i>,\n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 190\n\xe2\x80\x93197 (1976) (striking down sex-based age restrictions on purchasing beer).</p>\n<p>Above all, the Court has been especially forgiving of third-party standing criteria for one particular category of cases: those involving the purported substantive due process right of a woman to abort her unborn child.  In <i>Singleton</i> v. <i>Wulff</i>,\n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 106 (1976)\n,<i> </i>a plurality of this Court fashioned a blanket rule allowing third-party standing in abortion cases.  <i>Id.,</i> at 118.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]t generally is appropriate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Court, \xe2\x80\x9cto allow a physician to assert the rights of women patients as against governmental interference with the abortion decision.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  Yet the plural-ity conceded that the traditional criteria for an exception tothe third-party standing rule were not met.  There are no \xe2\x80\x9cinsurmountable\xe2\x80\x9d obstacles stopping women seeking abortions from asserting their own rights, the plurality admitted.  Nor are there jurisdictional barriers.  <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113 (1973)\n, held that women seeking abortions fell into the mootness exception for cases \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98capable of repetition, yet seeking review,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d enabling them to sue after they terminated their pregnancies without showing that they intended to become pregnant and seek an abortion again.  <i>Id</i>., at 125.  Yet, since <i>Singleton</i>, the Court has unquestioningly accepted doctors\xe2\x80\x99 and clinics\xe2\x80\x99 vicarious assertion of the constitutional rights of hypothetical patients, even as women seeking abortions have successfully and repeatedly asserted their own rights before this Court.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p>\n<p>Here too, the Court does not question whether doctors and clinics should be allowed to sue on behalf of Texas women seeking abortions as a matter of course.  They should not.  The central question under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s abortion precedents is whether there is an undue burden on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion.  See <i>Casey</i>, 505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 877 (plurality opinion); see Part II, <i>infra</i>.  But the Court\xe2\x80\x99s permissive approach to third-party standing encourages litigation that deprives us of the information needed to resolve that issue.  Our precedents encourage abortion providers to sue\xe2\x80\x94and our cases then relieve them of any obligation to prove what burdens women actually face.  I find it astonishing that the majority can discover an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on women\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion for \xe2\x80\x9cthose [women] for whom [Texas\xe2\x80\x99 law] is an actual rather than an irrelevant restriction,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 39 (internal quotation marks omitted), without identifying how many women fit this description; their proximity to open clinics; or their preferences as to where they obtain abortions, and from whom.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]ommonsense inference[s]\xe2\x80\x9d that such a burden exists, <i>ante,</i> at 36, are no substitute for actual evidence.  There should be no surer sign that our jurisprudence has gone off the rails than this: After creating a constitutional right to abortion because it \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[s] the most intimate and personal choices a person may make in a lifetime, choices central to personal dignity and autonomy,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 851 (majority opinion), the Court has created special rules that cede its enforcement to others.</p>\n<p>II</p>\n<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion also reimagines the undue-burden standard used to assess the constitutionality of abortion restrictions.  Nearly 25 years ago, in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833\n, a plurality of this Court invented the \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d standard as a special test for gauging the permissibility of abortion restrictions.  <i>Casey</i> held that a law is unconstitutional if it imposes an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on a woman\xe2\x80\x99s ability to choose to have an abortion, meaning that it \xe2\x80\x9chas the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 877.  <i>Casey</i> thus instructed courts to look to whether a law substantially impedes women\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortion, and whether it is reasonably related to legitimate state interests.  As the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]here it has a rational basis to act, and it does not impose an undue burden, the State may use its regulatory power\xe2\x80\x9d to regulate aspects of abortion procedures, \xe2\x80\x9call in furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Carhart</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,\n158 (2007)\n.</p>\n<p>I remain fundamentally opposed to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s abortion jurisprudence.  <i>E.g., id.</i>, at 168\xe2\x80\x93169 (Thomas, J., concurring); <i>Stenberg, </i>530 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 980, 982 (Thomas, J., dissenting).  Even taking <i>Casey </i>as the baseline, however, the majority radically rewrites the undue-burden test in three ways.  First, today\xe2\x80\x99s decision requires courts to \xe2\x80\x9cconsider the burdens a law imposes on abortion access together with the benefits those laws confer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 19.  Second, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion tells the courts that, when the law\xe2\x80\x99s justifications are medically uncertain, they need not defer to the legislature, and must instead assess medical justifications for abortion restrictions by scrutinizing the record themselves.  <i>Ibid.  </i>Finally, even if a law imposes no \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle\xe2\x80\x9d to women\xe2\x80\x99s access to abortions, the law now must have more than a \xe2\x80\x9creasonabl[e] relat[ion] to .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. a legitimate state interest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(internal quotation marks omitted).  These precepts are nowhere to be found in <i>Casey </i>or its successors, and transform the undue-burden test to something much more akin to strict scrutiny.</p>\n<p>First, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s free-form balancing test is contrary to <i>Casey</i>.  When assessing Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s recordkeeping requirements for abortion providers, for instance, <i>Casey </i>did not weigh its benefits and burdens.  Rather, <i>Casey </i>held that the law had a legitimate purpose because data collection advances medical research, \xe2\x80\x9cso it cannot be said that the requirements serve no purpose other than to make abortions more difficult.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 901 (\xc2\xa0joint opinion of O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, Kennedy, and Souter, JJ.).  The opinion then asked whether the recordkeeping requirements imposed a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial obstacle,\xe2\x80\x9d and found none.  <i>Ibid</i>.  Contrary to the majority\xe2\x80\x99s statements, see <i>ante</i>, at 19, <i>Casey </i>did not balance the benefits and burdens of Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s spousal and parental notification provisions, either.  Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s spousal notification requirement, the plurality said, imposed an undue burden because findings established that the requirement would \xe2\x80\x9clikely .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. prevent a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94not because these burdens outweighed its benefits.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 893 (majority opinion); see <i>id.,</i> at 887\xe2\x80\x93894.  And <i>Casey </i>summarily upheld parental notification provisions because even pre-<i>Casey </i>decisions had done so.  <i>Id.</i>, at 899\xe2\x80\x93900 (joint opinion).</p>\n<p><i></i>Decisions in <i>Casey\xe2\x80\x99</i>s wake further refute the majority\xe2\x80\x99s benefits-and-burdens balancing test.  The Court in <i>Mazurek </i>v. <i>Armstrong</i>,\n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 968 (1997)\n (<i>per curiam</i>), had no difficulty upholding a Montana law authorizing only physicians to perform abortions\xe2\x80\x94even though no legislative findings supported the law, and the challengers claimed that \xe2\x80\x9call health evidence contradict[ed] the claim that there is any health basis for the law.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 973 (internal quotation marks omitted).  <i>Mazurek </i>also deemed objections to the law\xe2\x80\x99s lack of benefits \xe2\x80\x9csquarely foreclosed by <i>Casey </i>itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>Instead, the Court explained, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the Constitution gives the States broad latitude to decide that particular functions may be performed only by licensed professionals, <i>even if an objective assessment might suggest that those same tasks could be performed by others</i>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid. </i>(quoting <i>Casey, supra</i>, at 885; emphasis in original); see <i>Gonzales</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 164 (relying on <i>Mazurek</i>).</p>\n<p>Second, by rejecting the notion that \xe2\x80\x9clegislatures, and not courts, must resolve questions of medical uncertainty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante, </i>at 20, the majority discards another core element of the <i>Casey </i>framework.  Before today, this Court had \xe2\x80\x9cgiven state and federal legislatures wide discretion to pass legislation in areas where there is medical and scientific uncertainty.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 163.  This Court emphasized that this \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional rule\xe2\x80\x9d of deference \xe2\x80\x9cis consistent with <i>Casey</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.  </i>This Court underscored that legislatures should not be hamstrung \xe2\x80\x9cif some part of the medical community were disinclined to follow the proscription.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 166.  And this Court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]onsiderations of marginal safety, including the balance of risks, are within the legislative competence when the regulation is rational and in pursuit of legitimate ends.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.; see <i>Stenberg</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 971 (Kennedy, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cthe right of the legislature to resolve matters on which physicians disagreed\xe2\x80\x9d is \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed] beyond doubt\xe2\x80\x9d).  This Court could not have been clearer: When-ever medical justifications for an abortion restriction are debatable, that \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a sufficient basis to conclude in [a] facial attack that the [law] does not impose an undue burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales, </i>550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 164.  Otherwise, legislatures would face \xe2\x80\x9ctoo exacting\xe2\x80\x9d a standard.  <i>Id.,</i> at 166.</p>\n<p>Today, however, the majority refuses to leave disputed medical science to the legislature because past cases \xe2\x80\x9cplaced considerable weight upon the evidence and argument presented in judicial proceedings.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante,</i> at 20.  But while <i>Casey</i> relied on record evidence to uphold Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s spousal-notification requirement, that requirement had nothing to do with debated medical science.  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 888\xe2\x80\x93894 (majority opinion).  And while <i>Gonzales </i>observed that courts need not blindly accept all legislative findings, see <i>ante</i>, at 20,<i> </i>that does not help the majority.  <i>Gonzales </i>refused to accept Congress\xe2\x80\x99 finding of \xe2\x80\x9ca medical consensus that the prohibited procedure is never medically necessary\xe2\x80\x9d because the procedure\xe2\x80\x99s necessity was debated within the medical community.  550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 165\xe2\x80\x93166.  Having identified medical uncertainty, <i>Gonzales </i>explained how courts should resolve conflicting<i> </i>positions: by respecting the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.  See <i>id.,</i> at 164.</p>\n<p>Finally, the majority overrules another central aspect of <i>Casey </i>by requiring laws to have more than a rational basis even if they do not substantially impede access to abortion.  <i>Ante,</i> at 19\xe2\x80\x9320.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhere [the State] <i>has a rational basis to act </i>and it does not impose an undue burden,\xe2\x80\x9d this Court previously held, \xe2\x80\x9cthe State may use its regulatory power\xe2\x80\x9d to impose regulations \xe2\x80\x9cin furtherance of its legitimate interests in regulating the medical profession in order to promote respect for life, including life of the unborn.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 158 (emphasis added); see <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 878 (plurality opinion) (similar).  No longer.  Though the majority declines to say how substantial a State\xe2\x80\x99s interest must be, <i>ante,</i> at 20, one thing is clear: The State\xe2\x80\x99s burden has been ratcheted to a level that has not applied for a quarter century.</p>\n<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion does resemble <i>Casey</i> in one respect: After disregarding significant aspects of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s prior jurisprudence, the majority applies the undue-burden standard in a way that will surely mystify lower courts for years to come.  As in <i>Casey</i>, today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion \xe2\x80\x9csimply .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. highlight[s] certain facts in the record that apparently strike the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. Justices as particularly significant in establishing (or refuting) the existence of an undue burden.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 991 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part); see <i>ante</i>, at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 31\xe2\x80\x9334.  As in <i>Casey</i>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe opinion then simply announces that the provision either does or does not impose a \xe2\x80\x98substantial obstacle\xe2\x80\x99 or an \xe2\x80\x98undue burden.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 991 (opinion of Scalia, J); see <i>ante</i>, at 26, 36.  And still \xe2\x80\x9c[w]e do not know whether the same conclusions could have been reached on a different record, or in what respects the record would have had to differ before an opposite conclusion would have been appropriate.\xe2\x80\x9d  505 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 991 (opinion of Scalia, J.); cf. <i>ante</i>, at 26, 31\xe2\x80\x9332.  All we know is that an undue burden now has little to do with whether the law, in a \xe2\x80\x9creal sense, deprive[s] women of the ultimate decision,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 875, and more to do with the loss of \xe2\x80\x9cindividualized attention, serious conversation, and emotional support,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante,</i> at 36.</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s undue-burden test looks far less like our post-<i>Casey</i> precedents and far more like the strict-scrutiny standard that <i>Casey </i>rejected, under which only the most compelling rationales justified restrictions on abortion.  See <i>Casey, supra,</i> at 871, 874\xe2\x80\x93875 (plurality opinion).  One searches the majority opinion in vain for any acknowledgment of the \xe2\x80\x9cpremise central\xe2\x80\x9d to <i>Casey</i>\xe2\x80\x99s rejection of strict scrutiny: \xe2\x80\x9cthat the government has a legitimate and substantial interest in preserving and promoting fetal life\xe2\x80\x9d from conception, not just in regulating medical procedures.  <i>Gonzales</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 145 (internal quotation marks omitted); see <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 846 (majority opinion), 871 (plurality opinion).  Meanwhile, the majority\xe2\x80\x99s undue-burden balancing approach risks ruling out even minor, previously valid infringements on access to abortion.  Moreover, by second-guessing medical evidence and making its own assessments of \xe2\x80\x9cquality of care\xe2\x80\x9d issues, <i>ante, </i>at 23\xe2\x80\x9324, 30\xe2\x80\x9331, 36, the majority reappoints this Court as \xe2\x80\x9cthe country\xe2\x80\x99s <i>ex officio</i> medical board with powers to disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 164 (internal quotation marks omitted).  And the majority seriously burdens States, which must guess at how much more compelling their interests must be to pass muster and what \xe2\x80\x9ccommonsense inferences\xe2\x80\x9d of an undue burden this Court will identify next.</p>\n<p>III</p>\n<p>The majority\xe2\x80\x99s furtive reconfiguration of the standard of scrutiny applicable to abortion restrictions also points to a deeper problem.  The undue-burden standard is just one variant of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s tiers-of-scrutiny approach to constitutional adjudication.  And the label the Court affixes to its level of scrutiny in assessing whether the government can restrict a given right\xe2\x80\x94be it \xe2\x80\x9crational basis,\xe2\x80\x9d intermediate, strict, or something else\xe2\x80\x94is increasingly a meaningless formalism.  As the Court applies whatever standard it likes to any given case, nothing but empty words separates our constitutional decisions from judicial fiat.</p>\n<p>Though the tiers of scrutiny have become a ubiquitous feature of constitutional law, they are of recent vintage.  Only in the 1960\xe2\x80\x99s did the Court begin in earnest to speak of \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d versus reviewing legislation for mere rationality, and to develop the contours of these tests.  See Fallon, Strict Judicial Scrutiny, 54 UCLA L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1267, 1274, 1284\xe2\x80\x931285 (2007).  In short order, the Court adopted strict scrutiny as the standard for reviewing everything from race-based classifications under the Equal Protection Clause to restrictions on constitutionally protected speech.  <i>Id.,</i> at 1275\xe2\x80\x931283.  <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113\n, then applied strict scrutiny to a purportedly \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental\xe2\x80\x9d substantive due process right for the first time.  <i>Id.</i>, at 162\xe2\x80\x93164; see Fallon, <i>supra,</i> at 1283; accord, <i>Casey</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 871 (plurality opinion) (noting that post-<i>Roe </i>cases interpreted <i>Roe </i>to demand \xe2\x80\x9cstrict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x9d).  Then the tiers of scrutiny proliferated into ever more gradations.  See, <i>e.g., Craig, </i>429 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 197\xe2\x80\x93198 (intermediate scrutiny for sex-based classifications); <i>Lawrence</i> v. <i>Texas</i>,\n\n539 U.\xc2\xa0S. 558,\n580 (2003)\n (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (\xe2\x80\x9ca more searching form of rational basis review\xe2\x80\x9d applies to laws reflecting \xe2\x80\x9ca desire to harm a politically unpopular group\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Buckley</i> v. <i>Valeo</i>,\n\n424 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n25 (1976)\n (<i>per cu-riam</i>) (applying \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98closest scrutiny\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to campaign-financecontribution limits).  <i>Casey</i>\xe2\x80\x99s undue-burden test<i> </i>added yet another right-specific test on the spectrum betweenrational-basis and strict-scrutiny review.</p>\n<p>The illegitimacy of using \xe2\x80\x9cmade-up tests\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cdisplace longstanding national traditions as the primary determinant of what the Constitution means\xe2\x80\x9d has long been apparent.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 515,\n570 (1996)\n (Scalia, J., dissenting).  The Constitution does not prescribe tiers of scrutiny.  The three basic tiers\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9crational basis,\xe2\x80\x9d intermediate, and strict scrutiny\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9care no more scientific than their names suggest, and a further element of randomness is added by the fact that it is largely up to us which test will be applied in each case.\xe2\x80\x9d<b> </b><i> </i><i>Id.,</i> at 567; see also <i>Craig</i>, <i>supra, </i>at 217\xe2\x80\x93221 (Rehnquist, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>But the problem now goes beyond that.  If our recent cases illustrate anything, it is how easily the Court tinkers with levels of scrutiny to achieve its desired result.  This Term, it is easier for a State to survive strict scrutiny despite discriminating on the basis of race in college admissions than it is for the same State to regulate how abortion doctors and clinics operate under the putatively less stringent undue-burden test.  All the State apparently needs to show to survive strict scrutiny is a list of aspirational educational goals (such as the \xe2\x80\x9ccultivat[ion of] a set of leaders with legitimacy in the eyes of the citizenry\xe2\x80\x9d) and a \xe2\x80\x9creasoned, principled explanation\xe2\x80\x9d for why it is pursuing them\xe2\x80\x94then this Court defers.  <i>Fisher</i> v. <i>University of Tex. at Austin</i>, <i>ante,</i> at 7, 12 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Yet the same State gets no deference under the undue-burden test, despite producing evidence that abortion safety, one rationale for Texas\xe2\x80\x99 law, is medically debated.  See <i>Whole Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Health</i> v. <i>Lakey</i>, 46 F. Supp. 3d 673, 684 (WD Tex. 2014) (noting conflict in expert testimony about abortion safety).  Likewise, it is now easier for the government to restrict judicial candidates\xe2\x80\x99 campaign speech than for the Government to define marriage\xe2\x80\x94even though the former is subject to strict scrutiny and the latter was supposedly subject to some form of rational-basis review.  Compare <i>Williams-Yulee</i> v. <i>Florida Bar</i>, 575 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2015) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x939), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Windsor</i>, 570 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 20).</p>\n<p>These more recent decisions reflect the Court\xe2\x80\x99s tendency to relax purportedly higher standards of review for less-preferred rights.  <i>E.g.,</i> <i>Nixon</i> v. <i>Shrink Missouri Government PAC</i>,\n\n528 U.\xc2\xa0S. 377,\n421 (2000)\n (Thomas, J., dissenting) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe Court makes no effort to justify its deviation from the tests we traditionally employ in free speech cases\xe2\x80\x9d to review caps on political contributions).  Meanwhile, the Court selectively applies rational-basis review\xe2\x80\x94under which the question is supposed to be whether \xe2\x80\x9cany state of facts reasonably may be conceived to justify\xe2\x80\x9d the law, <i>McGowan</i> v. <i>Maryland</i>,\n\n366 U.\xc2\xa0S. 420,\n426 (1961)\n\xe2\x80\x94with formidable toughness.  <i>E.g., Lawrence</i>, 539 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 580 (O\xe2\x80\x99Connor, J., concurring in judgment) (at least in equal protection cases, the Court is \xe2\x80\x9cmost likely\xe2\x80\x9d to find no rational basis for a law if \xe2\x80\x9cthe challenged legislation inhibits personal relationships\xe2\x80\x9d); see <i>id.,</i> at 586 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (faulting the Court for applying \xe2\x80\x9can unheard-of form of rational-basis review\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>These labels now mean little.  Whatever the Court claims to be doing, in practice it is treating its \xe2\x80\x9cdoctrine referring to tiers of scrutiny as guidelines informing our approach to the case at hand, not tests to be mechanically applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Williams-Yulee</i>, <i>supra,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 1) (Breyer, J., concurring).  The Court should abandon the pretense that anything other than policy preferences underlies its balancing of constitutional rights and interests in any given case.</p>\n<p>IV</p>\n<p>It is tempting to identify the Court\xe2\x80\x99s invention of a constitutional right to abortion in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113\n, as the tipping point that transformed third-party standing doctrine and the tiers of scrutiny into an unworkable morass of special exceptions and arbitrary applications.  But those roots run deeper, to the very notion that some constitutional rights demand preferential treatment.  During the <i>Lochner </i>era, the Court considered the right to contract and other economic liberties to be fundamental requirements of due process of law.  See <i>Lochner</i> v. <i>New York</i>,\n\n198 U.\xc2\xa0S. 45 (1905)\n.  The Court in 1937 repudiated <i>Lochner</i>\xe2\x80\x99s foundations.  See <i>West Coast Hotel Co.</i> v. <i>Parrish</i>,\n\n300 U.\xc2\xa0S. 379\n\xe2\x80\x93387, 400 (1937).  But the Court then created a new taxonomy of preferred rights.</p>\n<p>In 1938, seven Justices heard a constitutional challenge to a federal ban on shipping adulterated milk in interstate commerce.  Without economic substantive due process, the ban clearly invaded no constitutional right.  See <i>United States </i>v. <i>Carolene Products Co.</i>,\n\n304 U.\xc2\xa0S. 144\n\xe2\x80\x93153 (1938).  Within Justice Stone\xe2\x80\x99s opinion for the Court, however, was a footnote that just three other Justices joined\xe2\x80\x94the famous <i>Carolene Products </i>Footnote 4.  See <i>ibid.,</i> n.\xc2\xa04; Lusky, Footnote Redux: A <i>Carolene Products </i>Reminiscence, 82 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1093, 1097 (1982).  The footnote\xe2\x80\x99s first paragraph suggested that the presumption of constitutionality that ordinarily attaches to legislation might be \xe2\x80\x9cnarrower .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when legislation appears on its face to be within a specific prohibition of the Constitution.\xe2\x80\x9d  304 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 152\xe2\x80\x93153, n.\xc2\xa04.  Its second paragraph appeared to question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether legislation which restricts those political processes, which can ordinarily be expected to bring about repeal of undesirable legislation, is to be subjected to more exacting judicial scrutiny under the general prohibitions of the [14th] Amendment than are most other types of legislation.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i>  And its third and most familiar paragraph raised the question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether prejudice against discrete and insular minorities may be a special condition, which tends seriously to curtail the operation of those political processes ordinarily to be relied upon to protect minorities, and which may call for a correspondingly more searching judicial inquiry.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p>Though the footnote was pure dicta, the Court seized upon it to justify its special treatment of certain personal liberties like the\n \nFirst Amendment and the right against discrimination on the basis of race\xe2\x80\x94but also rights not enumerated in the Constitution.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  As the Court identified which rights deserved special protection, it developed the tiers of scrutiny as part of its equal protection (and, later, due process) jurisprudence as a way to demand extra justifications for encroachments on these rights.  See Fallon, 54 UCLA L.\xc2\xa0Rev., at 1270\xe2\x80\x931273, 1281\xe2\x80\x931285.  And, having created a new category of fundamental rights, the Court loosened the reins to recognize even putative rights like abortion, see <i>Roe</i>, 410 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 162\xe2\x80\x93164, which hardly implicate \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete and insular minorities.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p><b></b>The Court also seized upon the rationale of the <i>Carolene Products </i>footnote to justify exceptions to third-party standing doctrine.  The Court suggested that it was tilting the analysis to favor rights involving actual or perceived minorities\xe2\x80\x94then seemingly counted the right to contraception as such a right.  According to the Court, what matters is the \xe2\x80\x9crelationship between one who acted to protect the rights of a minority and the minority itself\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94which, the Court suggested, includes the relationship \xe2\x80\x9cbetween an advocate of the rights of persons to obtain contraceptives and those desirous of doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Eisenstadt</i> v. <i>Baird</i>,\n\n405 U.\xc2\xa0S. 438,\n445 (1972)\n (citing<b> </b>Sedler, Standing to Assert Constitutional Jus Tertii in the Supreme Court, 71 Yale L.\xc2\xa0J. 599, 631 (1962)).</p>\n<p>Eighty years on, the Court has come full circle.  The Court has simultaneously transformed judicially created rights like the right to abortion into preferred constitutional rights, while disfavoring many of the rights actually enumerated in the Constitution.  But our Constitution renounces the notion that some constitutional rights are more equal than others.  A plaintiff either possesses the constitutional right he is asserting, or not\xe2\x80\x94and if not, the judiciary has no business creating ad\xc2\xa0hoc exceptions so that others can assert rights that seem especially important to vindicate.  A law either infringes a constitutional right, or not; there is no room for the judiciary to invent tolerable degrees of encroachment.  Unless the Court abides by one set of rules to adjudicate constitu-tional rights, it will continue reducing constitutional law to policy-driven value judgments until the last shreds of its legitimacy disappear.</p>\n<p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p>Today\xe2\x80\x99s decision will prompt some to claim victory, just as it will stiffen opponents\xe2\x80\x99 will to object.  But the entire Nation has lost something essential.  The majority\xe2\x80\x99s embrace of a jurisprudence of rights-specific exceptions and balancing tests is \xe2\x80\x9ca regrettable concession of defeat\xe2\x80\x94an acknowledgement that we have passed the point where \xe2\x80\x98law,\xe2\x80\x99 properly speaking, has any further application.\xe2\x80\x9d  Scalia, The Rule of Law as a Law of Rules, 56 U.

Instead, the dispositive issue here concerns a workaday question that can arise in any case no matter the subject, namely, whether the present case is barred by res judicata.  As a court of law, we have an obligation to apply such rules in a neutral fashion in all cases, regardless of the subject of the suit.  If anything, when a case involves a controversial issue, we should be especially careful to be scrupulously neutral in applying such rules.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court has not done so here.  On the contrary, determined to strike down two provisions of a new Texas abortion statute in all of their applications, the Court simply disregards basic rules that apply in all other cases.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here is the worst example.  Shortly after Texas enacted House Bill 2 (H.\xc2\xa0B. 2) in 2013, the petitioners in this case brought suit, claiming, among other things, that a provision of the new law requiring a physician performing an abortion to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital is \xe2\x80\x9cfacially\xe2\x80\x9d unconstitutional and thus totally unenforce-able.  Petitioners had a fair opportunity to make their case, but they lost on the merits in the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, and they chose not to petition this Court for review.  The judgment against them became final.  <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs. </i>v. <i>Abbott</i>, 951 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d 891 (WD Tex. 2013), aff\xe2\x80\x99d in part and rev\xe2\x80\x99d in part, 748 F.\xc2\xa03d 583 (CA5 2014) (<i>Abbott</i>).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the rules that apply in regular cases, petitioners could not relitigate the exact same claim in a second suit.  As we have said, \xe2\x80\x9ca losing litigant deserves no rematch after a defeat fairly suffered, in adversarial proceedings, on an issue identical in substance to the one he subsequently seeks to raise.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Astoria Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assn.</i> v. <i>Solimino</i>,\n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 104,\n107 (1991)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this abortion case, however, that rule is disregarded.  The Court awards a victory to petitioners on the very claim that they unsuccessfully pressed in the earlier case.  The Court does this even though petitioners, undoubtedly realizing that a rematch would not be allowed, did not presume to include such a claim in their complaint.  The Court favors petitioners with a victory that they did not have the audacity to seek.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here is one more example: the Court\xe2\x80\x99s treatment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cseverability clause.\xe2\x80\x9d  When part of a statute is held to be unconstitutional, the question arises whether other parts of the statute must also go.  If a statute says that provisions found to be unconstitutional can be severed from the rest of the statute, the valid provisions are allowed to stand.  H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 contains what must surely be the most emphatic severability clause ever written.  This clause says that every single word of the statute and every possible application of its provisions is severable.  But despite this language, the Court holds that no part of the challenged provisions and no application of any part of them can be saved.  Provisions that are indisputably constitutional\xe2\x80\x94for example, provisions that require facilities performing abortions to follow basic fire safety measures\xe2\x80\x94are stricken from the books.  There is no possible justification for this collateral damage.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s patent refusal to apply well-established law in a neutral way is indefensible and will undermine public confidence in the Court as a fair and neutral arbiter.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Res judicata\xe2\x80\x94or, to use the more modern terminology, \xe2\x80\x9cclaim preclusion\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is a bedrock principle of our legal system.  As we said many years ago, \xe2\x80\x9c[p]ublic policy dictates that there be an end of litigation[,] that those who have contested an issue shall be bound by the result of the contest, and that matters once tried shall be considered forever settled as between the parties.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Baldwin</i> v. <i>Iowa State Traveling Men\xe2\x80\x99s Assn.</i>,\n\n283 U.\xc2\xa0S. 522,\n525 (1931)\n.  This doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cis central to the purpose for which civil courts have been established, the conclusive resolution of disputes within their jurisdictions.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. To preclude parties from contesting matters that they have had a full and fair opportunity to litigate protects their adversaries from the expense and vexation attending multiple lawsuits, conserves judicial resources, and fosters reliance on judicial action by minimizing the possibility of inconsistent decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Montana</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n440 U.\xc2\xa0S. 147\n\xe2\x80\x93154 (1979).  These are \xe2\x80\x9cvital public interests\xe2\x80\x9d that should be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cordially regarded and enforced.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Federated Department Stores, Inc.</i> v. <i>Moitie</i>,\n\n452 U.\xc2\xa0S. 394,\n401 (1981)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The basic rule of preclusion is well known and has been frequently stated in our opinions.  Litigation of a \xe2\x80\x9ccause of action\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d is barred if (1) the same (or a closely related) party (2) brought a prior suit asserting the same cause of action or claim, (3) the prior case was adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction and (4) was decided on the merits, (5) a final judgment was entered, and (6) there is no ground, such as fraud, to invalidate the prior judgment.  See <i>Montana</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 153; <i>Commissioner</i> v. <i>Sunnen</i>,\n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 591,\n597 (1948)\n; <i>Cromwell</i> v. <i>County of Sac</i>,\n\n94 U.\xc2\xa0S. 351\n\xe2\x80\x93353 (1877).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I turn first to the application of this rule to petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 claim that H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s admitting privileges requirement is facially unconstitutional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, all the elements set out above are easily satisfied based on <i>Abbott</i>,<i> </i>the 2013 case to which I previously referred.  That case (1) was brought by a group of plaintiffs that included petitioners in the present case, (2) asserted the same cause of action or claim, namely, a facial challenge to the constitutionality of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s admitting privileges requirement, (3) was adjudicated by courts of competent jurisdiction, (4) was decided on the merits, (5) resulted in the entry of a final judgment against petitioners, and (6) was not otherwise subject to invalidation.  All of this is clear, and that is undoubtedly why petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 attorneys did not even include a facial attack on the admitting privileges requirement in their complaint in this case.  To have done so would have risked sanctions for misconduct.  See <i>Robinson </i>v. <i>National Cash Register Co</i>., 808 F.\xc2\xa02d 1119, 1131 (CA5 1987) (a party\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cpersistence in litigating [a claim] when res judicata clearly barred the suit violated rule 11\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>McLaughlin </i>v.<i> Bradlee</i>, 602 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 1412, 1417 (DC 1985) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is especially appropriate to impose sanctions in situations where the doctrines of <i>res judicata</i> and collateral estoppel plainly preclude relitigation of the suit\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Of the elements set out above, the Court disputes only one.  The Court concludes that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 prior facial attack on the admitting privileges requirement and their current facial attack on that same requirement are somehow not the same cause of action or claim.  But that conclusion is unsupported by authority and plainly wrong.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the scope of a cause of action or claim for purposes of res judicata is hardly a new question, courts and scholars have struggled to settle upon a definition.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  But the outcome of the present case does not depend upon the selection of the proper definition from among those adopted or recommended over the years because the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding is not supported by any of them.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In <i>Baltimore S.\xc2\xa0S. Co.</i> v. <i>Phillips</i>,\n\n274 U.\xc2\xa0S. 316 (1927)\n, we defined a cause of action as an \xe2\x80\x9cactionable wrong.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 321; see also <i>ibid</i>. (\xe2\x80\x9cA cause of action does not consist of facts, but of the unlawful violation of a right which the facts show\xe2\x80\x9d).  On this understanding, the two claims at issue here are indisputably the same.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The same result is dictated by the rule recommended by the American Law Institute (ALI) in the first Restatement of Judgments, issued in 1942.  Section 61 of the first Restatement explains when a claim asserted by a plaintiff in a second suit is the same for preclusion purposes as a claim that the plaintiff unsuccessfully litigated in a prior case.  Under that provision, \xe2\x80\x9cthe plaintiff is precluded from subsequently maintaining a second action based upon the same transaction, if the evidence needed to sustain the second action would have sustained the first action.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement of Judgments \xc2\xa761.  There is no doubt that this rule is satisfied here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second Restatement of Judgments, issued by the ALI in 1982, adopted a new approach for determining the scope of a cause of action or claim.  In <i>Nevada</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n463 U.\xc2\xa0S. 110 (1983)\n, we noted that the two Restatements differ in this regard, but we had no need to determine which was correct.  <i>Id.,</i> at 130\xe2\x80\x93131, and n.\xc2\xa012.  Here, the majority simply assumes that we should follow the second Restatement even though that Restatement\xe2\x80\x94on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reading, at least\xe2\x80\x94leads to a conclusion that differs from the conclusion clearly dictated by the first Restatement.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the second Restatement actually supported the majority\xe2\x80\x99s holding, the Court would surely be obligated to explain why it chose to follow the second Restatement\xe2\x80\x99s approach.  But here, as in <i>Nevada</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 130\xe2\x80\x93131, application of the rule set out in the second Restatement does not change the result.  While the Court relies almost entirely on a comment to one section of the second Restatement, the Court ignores the fact that a straightforward application of the provisions of that Restatement leads to the conclusion that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 two facial challenges to the admitting privileges requirement constitute a single claim.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 19 of the second Restatement sets out the general claim-preclusion rule that applies in a case like the one before us: \xe2\x80\x9cA valid and final personal judgment rendered in favor of the defendant bars another action by the plaintiff on the same claim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 24(1) then explains the scope of the \xe2\x80\x9cclaim\xe2\x80\x9d that is extinguished: It \xe2\x80\x9cincludes all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the defendant with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 24\xe2\x80\x99s Comment <i>b</i>, in turn, fleshes out the key term \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction,\xe2\x80\x9d which it defines as \xe2\x80\x9ca natural grouping or common nucleus of operative facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Whether a collection of events constitutes a single transaction is said to depend on \xe2\x80\x9ctheir relatedness in time, space, origin, or motivation, and whether, taken together, they form a convenient unit for trial purposes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Both the claim asserted in petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 first suit and the claim now revived by the Court involve the same \xe2\x80\x9cnucleus of operative facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Indeed, they involve the very same \xe2\x80\x9coperative facts,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, the enactment of the admitting privileges requirement, which, according to the theory underlying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial claims, would inevitably have the effect of causing abortion clinics to close.  This is what petitioners needed to show\xe2\x80\x94and what they attempted to show in their first facial attack: not that the admit-ting privileges requirement had <i>already </i>imposed a substantial burden on the right of Texas women to obtain abortions, but only that it <i>would have</i> that effect once clinics were able to assess whether they could practicably comply.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833 (1992)\n, makes that clear.  <i>Casey</i> held that Pennsylvania\xe2\x80\x99s spousal notification requirement was facially unconstitutional even though that provision had been enjoined prior to enforcement.  See <i>id.</i>, at 845.  And the Court struck down the provision because it \xe2\x80\x9c<i>will</i> <i>impose</i> a substantial obstacle.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 893\xe2\x80\x93894 (emphasis added).  See also <i>id.,</i> at 893 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe spousal notification requirement <i>is thus likely to prevent</i> a significant number of women from obtaining an abortion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)); <i>id</i>., at 894 (Women \xe2\x80\x9c<i>are likely to be deterred</i> from procuring an abortion\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Consistent with this understanding, what petitioners tried to show in their first case was that the admitting privileges requirement would cause clinics to close.  They claimed that their evidence showed that \xe2\x80\x9cat least one-third of the State\xe2\x80\x99s licensed providers <i>would stop</i> providing abortions once the privileges requirement took effect.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  Agreeing with petitioners, the District Court enjoined enforcement of the requirement on the ground that \xe2\x80\x9cthere <i>will be</i> abortion clinics<i> that will close</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott</i>, 951 F.\xc2\xa0Supp.\xc2\xa02d, at 900 (emphasis added).  The Fifth Circuit found that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence of likely effect was insufficient, stating that petitioners failed to prove that \xe2\x80\x9cany woman <i>will lack</i> reasonable access to a clinic within Texas.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Abbott</i>,<i> </i>748 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 598 (some emphasis added; some emphasis deleted).  The correctness of that holding is irrelevant for present purposes.  What matters is that the \xe2\x80\x9coperative fact\xe2\x80\x9d in the prior case was the enactment of the admitting privileges requirement, and that is precisely the same operative fact underlying petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial attack in the case now before us.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">C</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In light of this body of authority, how can the Court maintain that the first and second facial claims are really two different claims?  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s first argument is that petitioners did not bring two facial claims because their complaint in the present case sought only as-applied relief and it was the District Court, not petitioners, who injected the issue of facial relief into the case.  <i>Ante</i>, at 11.  (After the District Court gave them statewide relief, petitioners happily accepted the gift and now present their challenge as a facial one.  See Reply Brief 24\xe2\x80\x9325 (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]acial invalidation is the only way to ensure that the Texas requirements do not extinguish women\xe2\x80\x99s liberty\xe2\x80\x9d).)  The thrust of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s argument is that a trial judge can circumvent the rules of claim preclusion by granting a plaintiff relief on a claim that the plaintiff is barred from relitigating.  Not surprisingly, the Court musters no authority for this proposition, which would undermine the interests that the doctrine of claim preclusion is designed to serve.  A \xe2\x80\x9cfundamental precept of common-law adjudication is that an issue once determined by a competent court is conclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>California</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605,\n619 (1983)\n.  This interest in finality is equally offended regardless of whether the precluded claim is included in a complaint or inserted into the case by a judge.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Another argument tossed off by the Court is that the judgment on the admitting privileges claim in the first case does not have preclusive effect because it was based on \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the prematurity of the action.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa720(2)).  But this argument grossly mischaracterizes the basis for the judgment in the first case.  The Court of Appeals did not hold that the facial challenge was premature.  It held that the evidence petitioners offered was insufficient.  See <i>Abbott</i>,<i> </i>748 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 598\xe2\x80\x93599; see also n.\xc2\xa09, <i>infra</i>.  Petitioners could have sought review in this Court, but elected not to do so.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This brings me to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s main argument\xe2\x80\x94that the second facial challenge is a different claim because of \xe2\x80\x9cchanged circumstances.\xe2\x80\x9d  What the Court means by this is that petitioners now have better evidence than they did at the time of the first case with respect to the number of clinics that would have to close as a result of the admitting privileges requirement.  This argument is contrary to a cardinal rule of res judicata, namely, that a plaintiff who loses in a first case cannot later bring the same case sim-ply because it has now gathered better evidence.  Claim preclusion does not contain a \xe2\x80\x9cbetter evidence\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  See, <i>e.g.</i>,<i> Torres </i>v. <i>Shalala</i>, 48 F.\xc2\xa03d 887, 894 (CA5 1995) (\xe2\x80\x9cIf simply submitting new evidence rendered a prior decision factually distinct, <i>res judicata</i> would cease to exist\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> Geiger </i>v. <i>Foley Hoag LLP Retirement Plan</i>, 521 F.\xc2\xa03d 60, 66 (CA1 2008) (Claim preclusion \xe2\x80\x9capplies even if the litigant is prepared to present different evidence .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. in the second action\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> Saylor </i>v. <i>United States</i>, 315 F.\xc2\xa03d 664, 668 (CA6 2003) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. new evidence might change the outcome of the case does not affect application of claim preclusion doctrine\xe2\x80\x9d);<i> International Union of Operating Engineers-Employers Constr. Industry Pension, Welfare and Training Trust Funds </i>v. <i>Karr</i>, 994 F.\xc2\xa02d 1426, 1430 (CA9 1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that some different evidence may be presented in this action .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , however, does not defeat the bar of res judicata\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa725, Comment <i>b</i> (\xe2\x80\x9cA mere shift in the evidence offered to support a ground held unproved in a prior action will not suffice to make a new claim avoiding the preclusive effect of the judgment\xe2\x80\x9d); 18 C. Wright, A. Miller, &amp; E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74403, p.\xc2\xa033 (2d ed. 2002) (Wright &amp; Miller) (Res judicata \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily applies despite the availability of new evidence\xe2\x80\x9d); Restatement of Judgments \xc2\xa71, Comment <i>b</i> (The ordinary rules of claim preclusion apply \xe2\x80\x9calthough the party against whom a judgment is rendered is later in a position to produce better evidence so that he would be successful in a second action\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In an effort to get around this hornbook rule, the Court cites a potpourri of our decisions that have no bearing on the question at issue.  Some are not even about res judicata.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  And the cases that do concern res judicata, <i>Abie State Bank</i> v. <i>Bryan</i>,\n\n282 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,\n772 (1931)\n, <i>Lawlor</i> v. <i>National Screen Service Corp.</i>,\n\n349 U.\xc2\xa0S. 322,\n328 (1955)\n, and <i>Third Nat. Bank of Louisville</i> v. <i>Stone</i>,\n\n174 U.\xc2\xa0S. 432,\n434 (1899)\n, endorse the unremarkable proposition that a prior judgment does not preclude new claims based on acts occurring after the time of the first judgment.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]  But petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 second facial challenge is not based on new acts postdating the first suit.  Rather, it is based on the same underlying act, the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, which allegedly posed an undue burden.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I come now to the authority on which the Court chiefly relies, Comment<i> f</i> to \xc2\xa724 of the second Restatement.

Where important human values\xe2\x80\x94such as the lawfulness of a continuing personal disability or restraint\xe2\x80\x94are at stake, even a slight change of circumstances <i>may</i> afford a sufficient basis for concluding that a second action may be brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As the word I have highlighted\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94should make clear, this comment does not say that \xe2\x80\x9c[m]aterial operative facts occurring after the decision of an action\xe2\x80\x9d always or even usually form \xe2\x80\x9cthe basis of a second action not precluded by the first.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rather, the comment takes the view that this \xe2\x80\x9cmay\xe2\x80\x9d be so.  Accord, <i>ante</i>, at 11 (\xe2\x80\x9c[D]evelopment of new material facts <i>can</i> mean that a new case and an otherwise similar previous case do not present the same claim\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).  The question, then, is <i>when</i> the development of new material facts should lead to this conclusion.  And there are strong reasons to conclude this should be a very narrow exception indeed.  Otherwise, this statement, relegated to a mere comment, would revolutionize the rules of claim preclusion\xe2\x80\x94by permitting a party to relitigate a lost claim whenever it obtains better evidence. Comment <i>f</i> was surely not meant to upend this fundamental rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What the comment undoubtedly means is far more modest\xe2\x80\x94only that in a few, limited circumstances the development of new material facts should (in the opinion of the ALI) permit relitigation.  What are these circumstances?  Section 24 includes three illustrative examples in the form of hypothetical cases, and none resembles the present case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In the first hypothetical case, the subsequent suit is based on new events that provide a basis for relief under a different legal theory.

It does not involve a claim based on postjudgment acts and a new legal theory.  It does not ask us to adjudicate a person\xe2\x80\x99s status.  And it does not involve a continuing course of conduct to be proved by the State\xe2\x80\x99s new acts.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The final illustration actually undermines the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  The Reporter\xe2\x80\x99s Note links this illustration to a Fifth Circuit case, <i>Exhibitors Poster Exchange, Inc. </i>v.<i> National Screen Service Corp.</i>, 421 F. 2d 1313 (1970).  In that case, the court distinguished between truly postjudgment acts and \xe2\x80\x9cacts which have been completed [prior to the previous judgment] except for their consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 1318.  Only postjudgment acts\xe2\x80\x94and not postjudgment consequences\xe2\x80\x94the Fifth Circuit held, can give rise to a new cause of action.  See <i>ibid.</i>[<a href="#F7" name="T7">7</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, the Court does not rely on any new acts performed by the State of Texas after the end of the first case.  Instead, the Court relies solely on what it takes to be new consequences, the closing of additional clinics, that are said to have resulted from the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">D</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">For these reasons, what the Court has done here is to create an entirely new exception to the rule that a losing plaintiff cannot relitigate a claim just because it now has new and better evidence.  As best I can tell, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s new rule must be something like this: If a plaintiff initially loses because it failed to provide adequate proof that a challenged law will have an unconstitutional effect and if subsequent developments tend to show that the law will in fact have those effects, the plaintiff may relitigate the same claim.  Such a rule would be unprecedented, and I am unsure of its wisdom, but I am certain of this: There is no possible justification for such a rule unless the plaintiff, at the time of the first case, could not have reasonably shown what the effects of the law would be.  And that is not the situation in this case.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court does not contend that petitioners, at the time of the first case, could not have gathered and provided evidence that was sufficient to show that the admitting privileges requirement <i>would cause</i> a sufficient number of clinic closures.  Instead, the Court attempts to argue that petitioners could not have shown at that time that a sufficient number of clinics <i>had already closed</i>.  As I have explained, that is not what petitioners need to show or what they attempted to prove.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the Court is also wrong in its understanding of petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 proof in the first case.  In support of its holding that the admitting privileges requirement now  \xe2\x80\x9cplaces a \xe2\x80\x98substantial obstacle in the path of a woman\xe2\x80\x99s choice,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court relies on two facts: \xe2\x80\x9cEight abortion clinics closed in the months leading up to the requirement\xe2\x80\x99s effective date\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[e]leven more closed on the day the admitting-privileges requirement took effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 24.  But petitioners put on evidence addressing exactly this issue in their first trial.  They apparently surveyed 27 of the 36 abortion clinics they identified in the State, including all 24 of the clinics owned by them or their coplaintiffs, to find out what impact the requirement would have on clinic operations.  See Appendix, <i>infra</i> (App. K to Emergency Application To Vacate Stay in <i>Planned Parenthood of Greater Tex. Surgical Health Servs.</i> v. <i>Abbott</i>, O. T. 2013, No. 13A452, Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 Trial Exh. 46).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That survey claimed to show that the admitting privileges requirement would cause 15 clinics to close.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">8</a>]  See <i>ibid.</i>  The Fifth Circuit had that evidence before it, and did not refuse to consider it.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">9</a>]  If that evidence was sufficient to show that the admitting privileges rule created an unlawful impediment to abortion access (and the District Court indeed thought it sufficient), then the decision of the Fifth Circuit in the first case was wrong as a matter of law.  Petitioners could have asked us to review that decision, but they chose not to do so.  A tactical decision of that nature has consequences.  While it does not mean that the admitting privileges requirement is immune to a facial challenge, it does mean that these petitioners and the other plaintiffs in the first case cannot mount such a claim.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the Court thinks that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 evidence in the first case was insufficient, the Court does not claim that petitioners, with reasonable effort, could not have gathered sufficient evidence to show with some degree of accuracy what the effects of the admitting privileges requirement would be.  As I have just explained, in their first trial petitioners introduced a survey of 27 abortion clinics indicating that 15 would close because of the admitting privileges requirement.  The Court does not identify what additional evidence petitioners needed but were unable to gather.  There is simply no reason why petitioners should be allowed to relitigate their facial claim.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">E</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">So far, I have discussed only the first of the two sentences in Comment <i>f</i>, but the Court also relies on the second sentence.  I reiterate what that second sentence says:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere important human values\xe2\x80\x94such as the lawfulness of a continuing personal disability or restraint\xe2\x80\x94are at stake, even a slight change of circumstances may afford a sufficient basis for concluding that a second action may be brought.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa724, Comment <i>f</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The second Restatement offers no judicial support whatsoever for this suggestion, and thus the comment \xe2\x80\x9cmust be regarded as a proposal for change rather than a restatement of existing doctrine, since the commentary refers to not a single case, of this or any other United States court.\xe2\x80\x9d<b> </b><i>United States</i> v. <i>Stuart</i>,\n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 353,\n375 (1989)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  The sentence also sits in considerable tension with our decisions stating that res judicata must be applied uniformly and without regard to what a court may think is just in a particular case.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Moitie</i>, 452 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 401 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe doctrine of res judicata serves vital public interests beyond any individual judge\xe2\x80\x99s ad\xc2\xa0hoc determination of the equities in a particular case\xe2\x80\x9d).  Not only did this sentence seemingly come out of nowhere, but it appears that no subsequent court has relied on this sentence as a ground for decision.  And while a few decisions have cited the \xe2\x80\x9cimportant human values\xe2\x80\x9d language, those cases invariably involve the relitigation of personal status determinations, as discussed in Comment <i>f</i>\xe2\x80\x99s Illustration 11.  See, <i>e.g., People ex\xc2\xa0rel.</i> <i>Leonard HH. </i>v. <i>Nixon</i>, 148 App.\xc2\xa0Div.\xc2\xa02d 75, 79\xe2\x80\x9380, 543 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa02d 998, 1001 (1989) (\xe2\x80\x9c[B]y its very nature, litigation concerning the <i>status </i>of a person\xe2\x80\x99s mental capacity does not lend itself to strict application of res judicata on a transactional analysis basis\xe2\x80\x9d).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">10</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">In sum, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 second facial challenge to the admitting privileges requirement is not barred by claim preclusion is not supported by any of our cases or any body of lower court precedent; is contrary to the bedrock rule that a party cannot relitigate a claim simply because the party has obtained new and better evidence; is contrary to the first Restatement of Judgments and the actual rules of the second Restatement of Judgment; and is purportedly based largely on a single comment in the second Restatement, but does not even represent a sensible reading of that comment.  In a regular case, an attempt by petitioners to relitigate their previously unsuccessful facial challenge to the admitting privileges requirement would have been rejected out of hand\xe2\x80\x94indeed, might have resulted in the imposition of sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11.  No court would even think of reviving such a claim on its own.  But in this abortion case, ordinary rules of law\xe2\x80\x94and fairness\xe2\x80\x94are suspended.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-H2">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I now turn to the application of principles of claim preclusion to a claim that petitioners did include in their second complaint, namely, their facial challenge to the requirement in H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 that abortion clinics comply with the rules that govern ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs).  As we have said many times, the doctrine of claim preclusion not only bars the relitigation of previously litigated claims; it can also bar claims that are closely related to the claims unsuccessfully litigated in a prior case.  See <i>Moitie</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 398; <i>Montana</i>, 440 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As just discussed, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding on the admitting privileges issue is based largely on a comment to \xc2\xa724 of the second Restatement, and therefore one might think that consistency would dictate an examination of what \xc2\xa724 has to say on the question whether the ASC challenge should be barred.  But consistency is not the Court\xe2\x80\x99s watchword here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Section 24 sets out the general rule regarding the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[s]plitting\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d of claims.  This is the rule that determines when the barring of a claim that was previously litigated unsuccessfully also extinguishes a claim that the plaintiff could have but did not bring in the first case.  Section 24(1) states that the new claim is barred if it is \xe2\x80\x9cany part of the transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of which the action arose.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Here, it is evident that petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 challenges to the admitting privileges requirement and the ASC requirement are part of the same transaction or series of connected transactions.  If, as I believe, the \xe2\x80\x9ctransaction\xe2\x80\x9d is the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, then the two facial claims are part of the very same transaction.  And the same is true even if the likely or actual effects of the two provisions constitute the relevant transactions.  Petitioners argue that the admitting privileges requirement and the ASC requirements <i>combined</i> have the effect of unconstitutionally restricting access to abortions.  Their brief repeatedly refers to the collective effect of the \xe2\x80\x9crequirements.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioners 40, 41, 42, 43, 44.  They describe the admitting privileges and ASC requirements as delivering a \xe2\x80\x9cone-two punch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 40.  They make no effort whatsoever to separate the effects of the two provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Court nevertheless holds that there are two \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful differences\xe2\x80\x9d that justify a departure from the general rule against splitting claims.  <i>Ante</i>, at 16.  Neither has merit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">First, pointing to a statement in a pocket part to a treatise, the Court says that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts normally treat challenges to distinct regulatory requirements as \xe2\x80\x98separate claims,\xe2\x80\x99 even when they are part of one overarching \xe2\x80\x98[g]overnment regulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (quoting 18 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74408, at 54 (2d ed. 2002, Supp. 2016)).  As support for this statement, the treatise cites one case, <i>Hamilton\xe2\x80\x99s Bogarts, Inc. </i>v.<i> Michigan</i>, 501 F. 3d 644, 650 (CA6 2007).  Even if these authorities supported the rule invoked by the Court (and the Court points to no other authorities), they would hardly be sufficient to show that \xe2\x80\x9ccourts normally\xe2\x80\x9d proceed in accordance with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule.  But in fact neither the treatise nor the Sixth Circuit decision actually supports the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rule.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">What the treatise says is the following:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cGovernment <i>regulatory schemes</i> provide regular examples of circumstances in which regulation of a single business by many different provisions <i>should lead</i> to recognition of separate claims when the business challenges different regulations.\xe2\x80\x9d  18 Wright &amp; Miller \xc2\xa74408, at 54 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, the treatise expresses a view about what the law \xe2\x80\x9cshould\xe2\x80\x9d be; it does not purport to state what courts \xe2\x80\x9cnormally\xe2\x80\x9d do.  And the recommendation of the treatise authors concerns different provisions of a \xe2\x80\x9cregulatory scheme,\xe2\x80\x9d which often embodies an accumulation of legislative enactments.  Petitioners challenge two provisions of one law, not just two provisions of a regulatory scheme.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Sixth Circuit decision is even further afield.  In that case, the plaintiff had previously lost a case challenging one rule of a state liquor control commission.  501 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 649\xe2\x80\x93650.  On the question whether the final judgment in that case barred a subsequent claim attacking another rule, the court held that the latter claim was \xe2\x80\x9clikely\xe2\x80\x9d not barred because, \xe2\x80\x9calthough [the first rule] was challenged in the first lawsuit, [the other rule] was not,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he state has not argued or made any showing that [the party] should also have challenged [the other rule] at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 650.  To say that these authorities providemeager support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning would be an exaggeration.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Beyond these paltry authorities, the Court adds only the argument that we should not \xe2\x80\x9cencourage a kitchen-sink approach to any litigation challenging the validity of statutes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 17.  I agree\xe2\x80\x94but that is not the situation in this case.  The two claims here are very closely related.  They are two parts of the same bill.  They both impose new requirements on abortion clinics.  They are justified by the State on the same ground, protection of the safety of women seeking abortions.  They are both challenged as imposing the same kind of burden (impaired access to clinics) on the same kind of right (the right to abortion, as announced in <i>Roe</i> v. <i>Wade</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 113 (1973)\n, and <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833\n).  And petitioners attack the two provisions as a package.  According to petitioners, the two provisions were both enacted for the same illegitimate purpose\xe2\x80\x94to close down Texas abortion clinics.  See Brief for Petitioners 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  And as noted, petitioners rely on the combined effect of the two requirements.  Petitioners have made little effort to identify the clinics that closed as a result of each requirement but instead aggregate the two requirements\xe2\x80\x99 effects.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, the two challenges \xe2\x80\x9cform a convenient trial unit.\xe2\x80\x9d  Restatement (Second) of Judgments \xc2\xa724(2)<i>.</i>  In fact, for a trial court to accurately identify the effect of each provision it would also need to identify the effect of the other provision.  Cf. <i>infra</i>, at 30.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Second, the Court claims that, at the time when petitioners filed their complaint in the first case, they could not have known whether future rules implementing the surgical center requirement would provide an exemption for existing abortion clinics.  <i>Ante</i>, at 17.  This argument is deeply flawed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere the inevitability of the operation of a statute against certain individuals is patent, it is irrelevant to the existence of a justiciable controversy that there will be a time delay before the disputed provisions will come into effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Regional Rail Reorganization Act Cases,</i>\n\n419 U.\xc2\xa0S. 102,\n143 (1974)\n.  And here, there was never any real chance that the Texas Department of State Health Services would exempt existing abortion clinics from all the ASC requirements.  As the Court of Appeals wrote, \xe2\x80\x9cit is abundantly clear from H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 that all abortion facilities must meet the standards already promulgated for ASCs.\xe2\x80\x9d   <i>Whole Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Health </i>v. <i>Cole</i>,<i> </i>790 F.\xc2\xa03d 563, 583 (2015) (<i>per curiam</i>) (case below).  See Tex. Health &amp; Safety Code Ann. \xc2\xa7245.010(a) (West Cum. Supp. 2015) (Rules implementing H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 \xe2\x80\x9cmust contain minimum standards .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for an abortion facility [that are] equivalent to the minimum standards .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. for ambulatory surgical centers\xe2\x80\x9d).  There is no apparent basis for the argument that H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 permitted the state health department to grant blanket exemptions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Whether there was any real likelihood that clinics would be exempted from <i>particular</i> ASC requirements is irrelevant because both petitioners and the Court view the ASC requirements as an indivisible whole.  Petitioners told the Fifth Circuit in unequivocal terms that they were \xe2\x80\x9cchalleng[ing] H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 broadly, with no effort whatsoever to parse out specific aspects of the ASC requirement that they f[ou]nd onerous or otherwise infirm.\xe2\x80\x9d  790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582.  Similarly, the majority views all the ASC provisions as an indivisible whole.  See <i>ante</i>, at 38 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute was meant to require abortion facilities to meet the integrated surgical-center standards\xe2\x80\x94not some subset thereof\xe2\x80\x9d).  On this view, petitioners had no reason to wait to see whether the Department of State Health Services might exempt them from some of the ASC rules.  Even if exemptions from some of the ASC rules had been granted, petitioners and the majority would still maintain that the provision of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 making the ASC rules applicable to abortion facilities is facially unconstitutional.  Thus, exemption from some of the ASC requirements would be entirely inconsequential.  The Court has no response to this point.  See <i>ante</i>, at 17.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these reasons, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 facial attack on the ASC requirements, like their facial attack on the admitting privileges rule, is precluded.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if res judicata did not bar either facial claim, a sweeping, statewide injunction against the enforcement of the admitting privileges and ASC requirements would still be unjustified.  Petitioners in this case are abortion clinics and physicians who perform abortions.  If they were sim-ply asserting a constitutional right to conduct a business or to practice a profession without unnecessary state regulation, they would have little chance of success.  See, <i>e.g., Williamson</i> v. <i>Lee Optical of Okla., Inc.</i>,\n\n348 U.\xc2\xa0S. 483 (1955)\n.  Under our abortion cases, however, they are permitted to rely on the right of the abortion patients they serve.  See <i>Doe</i> v. <i>Bolton</i>,\n\n410 U.\xc2\xa0S. 179,\n188 (1973)\n; but see <i>ante</i>, at 2\xe2\x80\x935 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Thus, what matters for present purposes is not the effect of the H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 provisions on petitioners but the effect on their patients.  Under our cases, petitioners must show that the admitting privileges and ASC requirements impose an \xe2\x80\x9cundue burden\xe2\x80\x9d on women seeking abortions.  <i>Gonzales</i> v. <i>Carhart</i>,\n\n550 U.\xc2\xa0S. 124,\n146 (2007)\n.  And in order to obtain the sweeping relief they seek\xe2\x80\x94facial invalidation of those provisions\xe2\x80\x94they must show, at a minimum, that these provisions have an unconstitutional impact on at least a \xe2\x80\x9clarge fraction\xe2\x80\x9d of Texas women of reproductive age.[<a href="#F11" name="T11">11</a>]  <i>Id.,</i> at 167\xe2\x80\x93168.  Such a situation could result if the clinics able to comply with the new requirements either lacked the requisite overall capacity or were located too far away to serve a \xe2\x80\x9clarge fraction\xe2\x80\x9d of the women in question.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Petitioners did not make that showing.  Instead of offering direct evidence, they relied on two crude inferences.  First, they pointed to the number of abortion clinics that closed after the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, and asked that it be inferred that all these closures resulted from the two challenged provisions.  See Brief for Petitioners 23\xe2\x80\x9324.  They made little effort to show why particular clinics closed.  Second, they pointed to the number of abortions performed annually at ASCs before H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 took effect and, because this figure is well below the total number of abortions performed each year in the State, they asked that it be inferred that ASC-compliant clinics could not meet the demands of women in the State.  See App. 237\xe2\x80\x93238.  Petitioners failed to provide any evidence of the actual capac-ity of the facilities that would be available to perform abortions in compliance with the new law\xe2\x80\x94even though they provided this type of evidence in their first case to the District Court at trial and then to this Court in their application for interim injunctive relief.  Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">I do not dispute the fact that H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 caused the closure of some clinics.  Indeed, it seems clear that H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 was intended to force unsafe facilities to shut down.  The law was one of many enacted by States in the wake of the Kermit Gosnell scandal, in which a physician who ran an abortion clinic in Philadelphia was convicted for the first-degree murder of three infants who were born alive and for the manslaughter of a patient.  Gosnell had not been actively supervised by state or local authorities or by his peers, and the Philadelphia grand jury that investigated the case recommended that the Commonwealth adopt a law requiring abortion clinics to comply with the same regulations as ASCs.[<a href="#F12" name="T12">12</a>]  If Pennsylvania had had such a requirement in force, the Gosnell facility may have been shut down before his crimes.  And if there were any similarly unsafe facilities in Texas, H. B. 2 was clearly in-tended to put them out of business.[<a href="#F13" name="T13">13</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">While there can be no doubt that H. B. 2 caused some clinics to cease operation, the absence of proof regarding the reasons for particular closures is a problem because some clinics have or may have closed for at least four reasons other than the two H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 requirements at issue here.  These are:</p>\n<p style="p-BQBegin">1.  <i>H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s restriction on medication abortion.</i>  In their first case, petitioners challenged the provision of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 that regulates medication abortion, but that part of the statute was upheld by the Fifth Circuit and not relitigated in this case.  The record in this case indicates that in the first six months after this restriction took effect, the number of medication abortions dropped by 6,957 (compared to the same period the previous year).  App. 236.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">2.  <i>Withdrawal of</i> <i>Texas family planning funds.</i>  In 2011, Texas passed a law preventing family planning grants to providers that perform abortions and their affiliates.  In the first case, petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert admitted that some clinics closed \xe2\x80\x9cas a result of the defunding,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F14" name="T14">14</a>] and as discussed below, this withdrawal appears specifically to have caused multiple clinic closures in West Texas.  See <i>infra</i>, at 29, and n. 18.</p>\n<p style="p-BQPara">3.  <i>The nationwide decline in abortion demand.</i>  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert testimony relies[<a href="#F15" name="T15">15</a>] on a study from the Guttmacher Institute which concludes that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[t]he national abortion rate has resumed its decline, and <i>no evidence was found that the overall drop in abortion incidence was related to the decrease in providers or to restrictions implemented between 2008 and 2011</i>.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1117 (direct testimony of Dr. Peter Uhlenberg) (quoting R. Jones &amp; J. Jerman, Abortion Incidence and Service Availability In the United States, 2011, 46 Perspectives on Sexual and Reproductive Health 3 (2014); emphasis in testimony).  Consistent with that trend, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he number of abortions to residents of Texas declined by 4,956 between 2010 and 2011 and by 3,905 between 2011 and 2012.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 1118.</p>\n<p style="p-BQEnd">4.  <i>Physician retirement (or other localized factors).</i>  Like everyone else, most physicians eventually retire, and the retirement of a physician who performs abortions can cause the closing of a clinic or a reduction in the number of abortions that a clinic can perform.  When this happens, the closure of the clinic or the reduction in capacity cannot be attributed to H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 unless it is shown that the retirement was caused by the admitting privileges or surgical center requirements as opposed to age or some other factor.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">At least nine Texas clinics may have ceased performing abortions (or reduced capacity) for one or more of the reasons having nothing to do with the provisions challenged here.  For example, in their first case, petitioners alleged that the medication-abortion restriction would cause at least three medication-only abortion clinics to cease performing abortions,[<a href="#F16" name="T16">16</a>] and they predicted that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]ther facilities that offer both surgical and medication abortion will be unable to offer medication abortion,\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F17" name="T17">17</a>] presumably reducing their capacity.  It also appears that several clinics (including most of the clinics operating in West Texas, apart from El Paso) closed in response to the unrelated law restricting the provision of family planning funds.[<a href="#F18" name="T18">18</a>]  And there is reason to question whether at least two closures (one in Corpus Christi and one in Houston) may have been prompted by physician retirements.[<a href="#F19" name="T19">19</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Neither petitioners nor the District Court properly addressed these complexities in assessing causation\xe2\x80\x94and for no good reason.  The total number of abortion clinics in the State was not large.  Petitioners could have put on evidence (as they did for 27 individual clinics in their first case, see Appendix, <i>infra</i>) about the challenged provisions\xe2\x80\x99 role in causing the closure of each clinic,[<a href="#F20" name="T20">20</a>] and the court could have made a factual finding as to the cause of each closure.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Precise findings are important because the key issue here is not the number or percentage of clinics affected, but the effect of the closures on women seeking abortions, <i>i.e.</i>, on the capacity and geographic distribution of clinics used by those women.  To the extent that clinics closed (or experienced a reduction in capacity) for any reason unrelated to the challenged provisions of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, the corresponding burden on abortion access may not be factored into the access analysis.  Because there was ample reason to believe that some closures were caused by these other factors,the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to ascertain the reasons for clinic closures means that, on the record before us, there is no way to tell which closures actually count.  Petitioners\xe2\x80\x94who, as plaintiffs, bore the burden of proof\xe2\x80\x94cannot simply point to temporal correlation and call it causation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the District Court had properly filtered out immaterial closures, its analysis would have been incomplete for a second reason.  Petitioners offered scant evidence on the capacity of the clinics that are able to comply with the admitting privileges and ASC requirements, or on those clinics\xe2\x80\x99 geographic distribution.  Reviewing the evidence in the record, it is far from clear that there has been a<i> </i>material impact on access to abortion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">On clinic capacity, the Court relies on petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert Dr. Grossman, who compared the number of abortions performed at Texas ASCs before the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 (about 14,000 per year) with the total number of abortions per year in the State (between 60,000\xe2\x80\x9370,000 per year).  <i>Ante</i>, at 32\xe2\x80\x9333.[<a href="#F21" name="T21">21</a>]  Applying what the Court terms \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense,\xe2\x80\x9d the Court infers that the ASCs that performed abortions at the time of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s enactment lacked the capacity to perform all the abortions sought by women in Texas.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court\xe2\x80\x99s inference has obvious limitations.  First, it is not unassailable \xe2\x80\x9ccommon sense\xe2\x80\x9d to hold that current utilization equals capacity; if all we know about a grocery store is that it currently serves 200 customers per week, <i>ante</i>, at 33, that fact alone does not tell us whether it is an overcrowded minimart or a practically empty supermarket.  Faced with increased demand, ASCs could potentially increase the number of abortions performed without prohibitively expensive changes.  Among other things, they might hire more physicians who perform abortions,[<a href="#F22" name="T22">22</a>] utilize their facilities more intensively or efficiently, or shift the mix of services provided.  Second, what matters for present purposes is not the capacity of just those ASCs that performed abortions prior to the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 but the capacity of those that would be available to perform abortions after the statute took effect.  And since the enactment of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, the number of ASCs performing abortions has increased by 50%\xe2\x80\x94from six in 2012 to nine today.[<a href="#F23" name="T23">23</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The most serious problem with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning is that its conclusion is belied by petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 own submissions to this Court.  In the first case, when petitioners asked this Court to vacate the Fifth Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s stay of the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s injunction of the admitting privileges requirement pending appeal, they submitted a chart previously provided in the District Court that detailed the capacity of abortion clinics after the admitting privileges requirement was to take effect.[<a href="#F24" name="T24">24</a>]  This chart is included as an Appendix to this opinion.[<a href="#F25" name="T25">25</a>]  Three of the facilities listed on the chart were ASCs, and their capacity was shown as follows:</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Southwestern Women\xe2\x80\x99s Surgery Center in Dallas was said to have the capacity for 5,720 abortions a year (110 per week);</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Planned Parenthood Surgical Health Services Center in Dallas was said to have the capacity for 6,240 abortions a year (120 per week); and</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Planned Parenthood Center for Choice in Houston was said to have the capacity for 9,100 abortions a year (175 per week).[<a href="#F26" name="T26">26</a>]  See Appendix, <i>infra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The average capacity of these three ASCs was 7,020 abortions per year.[<a href="#F27" name="T27">27</a>]  If the nine ASCs now performing abortions in Texas have the same average capacity, they have a total capacity of 63,180.  Add in the assumed capacity for two other clinics that are operating pursuant to the judgment of the Fifth Circuit (over 3,100 abortions per year),[<a href="#F28" name="T28">28</a>] and the total for the State is 66,280 abortions per year.  That is comparable to the 68,298 total abortions performed in Texas in 2012, the year before H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 was enacted, App. 236,[<a href="#F29" name="T29">29</a>] and well in excess of the abortion rate one would expect\xe2\x80\x9459,070\xe2\x80\x94if subtracting the apparent impact of the medication abortion restriction, see n.\xc2\xa021,  <i>supra</i>.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">To be clear, I do not vouch for the accuracy of this calculation.  It might be too high or too low.  The important point is that petitioners put on evidence of actual clinic capacity in their earlier case, and there is no apparent reason why they could not have done the same here.  Indeed, the Court asserts that, after the admitting privileges requirement took effect, clinics \xe2\x80\x9cwere not able to accommodate increased demand,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 35, but petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 own evidence suggested that the requirement had <i>no </i>effect on capacity, see n. 21, <i>supra</i>.  On this point, like the question of the reason for clinic closures, petitioners did not discharge their burden, and the District Court did not engage in the type of analysis that should have been conducted before enjoining an important state law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">So much for capacity.  The other[<a href="#F30" name="T30">30</a>] potential obstacle to abortion access is the distribution of facilities throughout the State.  This might occur if the two challenged H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 requirements, by causing the closure of clinics in some rural areas, led to a situation in which a \xe2\x80\x9clarge fraction\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F31" name="T31">31</a>] of women of reproductive age live too far away from any open clinic.  Based on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding in <i>Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pa.</i> v. <i>Casey</i>,\n\n505 U.\xc2\xa0S. 833\n, it appears that the need to travel up to 150 miles is not an undue burden,[<a href="#F32" name="T32">32</a>] and the evidence in this case shows that if the only clinics in the State were those that would have remained open if the judgment of the Fifth Circuit had not been enjoined, roughly 95% of the women of reproductive age in the State would live within 150 miles of an open facility (or lived outside that range before H.\xc2\xa0B. 2).[<a href="#F33" name="T33">33</a>]  Because the record does not show why particular facilities closed, the real figure may be even higher than 95%.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We should decline to hold that these statistics justify the facial invalidation of the H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 requirements.  The possibility that the admitting privileges requirement <i>might </i>have caused a closure in Lubbock is no reason to issue a facial injunction exempting Houston clinics from that requirement.  I do not dismiss the situation of those women who would no longer live within 150 miles of a clinic as a result of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2.  But under current doctrine such localized problems can be addressed by narrow as-applied challenges.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">IV</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Even if the Court were right to hold that res judicata does not bar this suit and that H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 imposes an undue burden on abortion access\xe2\x80\x94it is, in fact, wrong on both counts\xe2\x80\x94it is still wrong to conclude that the admitting privileges and surgical center provisions must be enjoined in their entirety.  H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 has an extraordinarily broad severability clause that must be considered before enjoining any portion or application of the law.  Both challenged provisions should survive in substantial part if the Court faithfully applies that clause.  Regrettably, it enjoins both in full, heedless of the (controlling) intent of the state legislature.  Cf. <i>Leavitt</i> v. <i>Jane L.</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 137,\n139 (1996)\n (<i>per curiam</i>) (\xe2\x80\x9cSeverability is of course a matter of state law\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying H.\xc2\xa0B. 2\xe2\x80\x99s severability clause to the admitting privileges requirement is easy.  Simply put, the requirement must be upheld in every city in which its application does not pose an undue burden.  It surely does not pose that burden anywhere in the eastern half of the State, where most Texans live and where virtually no woman of reproductive age lives more than 150 miles from an open clinic.  See App. 242, 244 (petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 expert testimony that 82.5% of Texas women of reproductive age live within 150 miles of open clinics in Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and San Antonio).  (Unfortunately, the Court does not address the State\xe2\x80\x99s argument to this effect. See Brief for Respondents 51.)  And petitioners would need to show that the requirement caused specific West Texas clinics to close (but see <i>supra,</i> at 29, and n. 18) before they could be entitled to an injunction tailored to address those closures.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Applying severability to the surgical center requirement calls for the identification of the particular provisions of the ASC regulations that result in the imposition of an undue burden.  These regulations are lengthy and detailed, and while compliance with some might be expensive, compliance with many others would not.  And many serve important health and safety purposes.  Thus, the surgical center requirements cannot be judged as a package.  But the District Court nevertheless held that all the surgical center requirements are unconstitutional in all cases, and the Court sustains this holding on grounds that are hard to take seriously.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">When the Texas Legislature passed H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, it left no doubt about its intent on the question of severability.  It included a provision mandating the greatest degree of severability possible.  The full provision is reproduced below,[<a href="#F34" name="T34">34</a>] but it is enough to note that under this provision \xe2\x80\x9cevery provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase, or word in this Act, and every application of the provisions in this Act, are severable from each other.\xe2\x80\x9d  H.\xc2\xa0B. 2, \xc2\xa710(b), App. to Pet. for Cert. 200a.<b> </b> And to drive home the point about the severability of applications of the law, the provision adds:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cIf any application of any provision in this Act to any person, group of persons, or circumstances is found by a court to be invalid, the remaining applications of that provision to all other persons and circumstances shall be severed and may not be affected.  All constitutionally valid applications of this Act shall be severed from any applications that a court finds to be invalid, leaving the valid applications in force, because it is the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s intent and priority that the valid applications be allowed to stand alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This provision indisputably requires that all surgical center regulations that are not themselves unconstitutional be left standing.  Requiring an abortion facility to com-ply with any provision of the regulations applicable to surgical centers is an \xe2\x80\x9capplication of the provision\xe2\x80\x9d of H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 that requires abortion clinics to meet surgical center standards.  Therefore, if some such applications are unconstitutional, the severability clause plainly requires that those applications be severed and that the rest be left intact.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">How can the Court possibly escape this painfully obvious conclusion?  Its main argument is that it need not honor the severability provision because doing so would be too burdensome.  See <i>ante</i>, at 38.  This is a remarkable argument.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under the Supremacy Clause, federal courts may strike down state laws that violate the Constitution or conflict with federal statutes, Art. VI, cl. 2, but in exercising this power, federal courts must take great care.  The power to invalidate a state law implicates sensitive federal-state relations.  Federal courts have no authority to carpet-bomb state laws, knocking out provisions that are per-fectly consistent with federal law, just because it would be too much bother to separate them from unconstitutional provisions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, it should not have been hard in this case for the District Court to separate any bad provisions from the good.  Petitioners should have identified the particular provisions that would entail what they regard as an undue expense, and the District Court could have then concentrated its analysis on those provisions.  In fact, petitioners <i>did </i>do this in their trial brief, Doc. 185, p.\xc2\xa08 in <i>Lakey</i> (Aug. 12, 2014) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the construction and nursing requirements that form the basis of Plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 challenge\xe2\x80\x9d), but they changed their position once the District Court awarded blanket relief, see 790 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 582 (petitioners told the Fifth Circuit that they \xe2\x80\x9cchallenge H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 broadly, with no effort whatsoever to parse out specific aspects of the ASC requirement that they find onerous or otherwise infirm\xe2\x80\x9d).  In its own review of the ASC requirement, in fact, the Court follows petitioners\xe2\x80\x99 original playbook and focuses on the construction and nursing requirements as well.  See <i>ante</i>, at 28\xe2\x80\x9329 (detailed walkthrough of Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7135.15 (2016) (nursing), 135.52 (construction)).  I do not see how it \xe2\x80\x9cwould inflict enormous costs on both courts and litigants,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>ante</i>, at 38, to single out the ASC regulations that this Court and petitioners have both targeted as the core of the challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">By forgoing severability, the Court strikes down numerous provisions that could not plausibly impose an undue burden.  For example, surgical center patients must \xe2\x80\x9cbe treated with respect, consideration, and dignity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tex. Admin. Code, tit. 25, \xc2\xa7135.5(a).  That\xe2\x80\x99s now enjoined.  Patients may not be given misleading \xe2\x80\x9cadvertising regarding the competence and/or capabilities of the organization.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7135.5(g).  Enjoined.  Centers must maintain fire alarm and emergency communications systems, \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7135.41(d), 135.42(e), and eliminate \xe2\x80\x9c[h]azards that might lead to slipping, falling, electrical shock, burns, poisoning, or other trauma,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7135.10(b).  Enjoined and enjoined.  When a center is being remodeled while still in use, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]emporary sound barriers shall be provided where intense, prolonged construction noises will disturb patients or staff in the occupied portions of the building.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7135.51(b)(3)(B)(vi).  Enjoined.  Centers must develop and enforce policies concerning teaching and publishing by staff.  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7135.16(a), (c).  Enjoined.  They must obtain informed consent before doing research on patients.  \xc2\xa7135.17(e).  Enjoined.  And each center \xe2\x80\x9cshall develop, im-plement[,] and maintain an effective, ongoing, organization-wide, data driven patient safety program.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7135.27(b).  Also enjoined.  These are but a few of the innocuous requirements that the Court invalidates with nary a wave of the hand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Any responsible application of the H.\xc2\xa0B. 2 severability provision would leave much of the law intact.  At a minimum, both of the requirements challenged here should be held constitutional as applied to clinics in any Texas city that will have a surgical center providing abortions (<i>i.e.</i>, those areas in which there cannot possibly have been an undue burden on abortion access).  Moreover, as even the District Court found, the surgical center requirement is clearly constitutional as to new abortion facilities and facilities already licensed as surgical centers.  <i>Whole Woman\xe2\x80\x99s Health </i>v. <i>Lakey</i>, 46 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 3d 673, 676 (WD Tex. 2014).  And we should uphold every application of every surgical center regulation that does not pose an undue burden\xe2\x80\x94at the very least, all of the regulations as to which petitioners have never made a specific complaint supported by specific evidence.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s wholesale refusal to engage in the required severability analysis here revives the \xe2\x80\x9cantagonistic \xe2\x80\x98canon of construction under which in cases involving abortion, a permissible reading of a statute is to be avoided at all costs.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Gonzales</i>, 550 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 153\xe2\x80\x93154 (quoting <i>Stenberg</i> v. <i>Carhart</i>,\n\n530 U.\xc2\xa0S. 914,\n977 (2000)\n (Kennedy, J., dissenting); some internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the Court is unwilling to undertake the careful severability analysis required, that is no reason to strike down all applications of the challenged provisions.  The proper course would be to remand to the lower courts for a remedy tailored to the specific facts shown in this case, to \xe2\x80\x9ctry to limit the solution to the problem.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ayotte</i> v. <i>Planned Parenthood of Northern New Eng.</i>,\n\n546 U.\xc2\xa0S. 320,\n328 (2006)\n.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">V</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">When we decide cases on particularly controversial issues, we should take special care to apply settled procedural rules in a neutral manner.
