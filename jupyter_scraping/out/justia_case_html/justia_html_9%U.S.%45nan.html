CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court to the following effect:</p>\n<p>The writ being returnable to the court, is returnable the first day of the court.  It was known to the Legislature of Virginia that the appearance day for all process was the day after the term.  When, therefore, it directed that a trial should be had at the return term, it must have intended that this case should be an exception to the general rule.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
