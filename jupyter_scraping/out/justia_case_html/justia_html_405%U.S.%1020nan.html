Langdeau, <a href="/cases/federal/us/371/555/case.html#558">371 U.S. 555, 558</a>, 522, we have determined that the requirement of finality had been satisfied. Similarly, where the subsequent proceedings in state court would deny the federal right for the vindication of which review was sought, we have concluded that the case was final. See, e.g., Klopfer v. North Carolina, <a href="/cases/federal/us/386/213/case.html">386 U.S. 213</a> (speedy trial); Harris v. Washington, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/55/case.html">404 U.S. 55</a>, 92 S. Ct. 183 (double jeopardy); Colombo v. New York, <a href="/cases/federal/us/405/9/case.html">405 U.S. 9</a> (double jeopardy). And, as Mr. Justice White indicated for the Court in Mercantile National Bank v. Langdeau,supra, 371 U.S., at 558, we have found the policies underlying 1257 satisfied where the matter to be reviewed was entirely \'separate and independent\' from those to be raised in the subsequent state proceedings. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p></p><p> In Mills v. Alabama, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/214/case.html">384 U.S. 214</a>, a case strikingly similar to the present one, we determined that the finality requirement had been met. There, the trial court had sustained a demurrer to the complaint, but the Supreme Court of Alabama reversed and remanded for trial. Mr. Justice Black, speaking for eight members of the Court, concluded that we had jurisdiction under 1257: </p><ul>\'The State has moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the Alabama Supreme Court\'s judgment is not a \'final judgment\' and therefore not appealable under 1257. The State argues that <p></p><p><a class="page-number" name="1023">Page 405 U.S. 1020 , 1023</a></p><p> since the Alabama Supreme Court remanded the case to the trial court for further proceedings not inconsistent with its opinion (which would include a trial), the Supreme Court\'s judgment cannot be considered \'final.\' This argument has a surface plausibility, since it is true the judgment of the State Supreme Court did not literally end the case. It did, however, render a judgment binding upon the trial court that it must convict Mills under this state statute if he wrote and published the editorial. Mills concedes that he did, and he therefore has no defense in the Alabama trial court. Thus if the case goes back to the trial court, the trial, so far as this record shows, would be no more than a few formal gestures leading inexorably towards a conviction, and then another appeal to the Alabama Supreme Court for it formally to repeat its rejection of Mills\' constitutional contentions whereupon the case could then once more wind its weary way back to us as a judgment unquestionably final and appealable. Such a roundabout process would not only be an inexcusable delay of the benefits Congress intended to grant by providing for appeal to this Court, but it would also result in a completely unnecessary waste of time and energy in judicial systems already troubled by delays due to congested dockets. The language of 1257 as we construed it in Pope v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., <a href="/cases/federal/us/345/379/case.html#381">345 U.S. 379, 381</a>-383, 750-751, does not require a result leading to such consequences.

State Board, <a href="/cases/federal/us/329/69/case.html">329 U.S. 69</a>, 72-74, 158-159. Following those cases we hold that we have jurisdiction.\' 384 U.S., at 217-218.

In light of appellant\'s concession that he has no other defense to offer should the case go to trial, and considering the importance of the First Amendment rights at stake in this litigation, it would require regard for some remote, theoretical interests of federalism to conclude that this Court lacks jurisdiction because of the unlikely possibility that a jury might disregard a trial judge\'s instructions and acquit.</ul> <ul>\'Indeed, even had appellant been unwilling to concede that he has no defense-apart from the constitutional question-to the charges against him, we would be warranted in reviewing this case. That result follows a fortiori from our holdings that where First Amendment rights are jeopardized by a state prosecution, which, by its very nature, threatens to deter others from exercising their First Amendment rights, a federal court will take the extraordinary step of enjoining the state prosecution.\' 384 U.S., at 221 . (Citations omitted.)</ul> <p> The issues petitioner tenders are important ones. They go to the constitutionality of mass seizures of materials presumptively protected by the First Amendment, Quantity of Copies of Books v.

United States, <a href="/cases/federal/us/275/192/case.html">275 U.S. 192</a>; and, of course, the obscenity vel non of the publications. </p><p> No significant question of fact or law remains for trial. It seems beyond argument that petitioner possessed the publications in question \'for sale or distribution.\' Cal.Penal Code 311.2. Petitioner\'s only viable defenses appear to be whether the publications were constitutionally protected and whether their seizure in some way was procedurally defective. These issues were passed upon by the courts below and are now before us for decision. </p><p> The purpose of furthering economy in judicial administration would plainly be served by deciding these questions now rather than by sending petitioner through the formalities of a trial and months-if not years-of repetitious appellate review before allowing him to present to this Court again the very issues that are here now. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>] California has sought to conserve its judicial resources by providing pretrial appellate review of suppression hearings. Where the admissibility of evidence is the only real issue, this policy generally results either in the prompt dismissal of the charges without trial or in a plea bargain and guilty plea. The interests in the smooth working of our federal system and our accommodation of California\'s interests in pretrial adjudication of dispositive questions of law dictate that we not postpone our consideration of the federal questions now presented. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1026">Page 405 U.S. 1020 , 1026</a></p><p> This is not a case involving only a pretrial motion to suppress. Rather, the motion now before us embraces all of the evidence the prosecution will introduce at trial and common to all of these items is the issue of their obscenity vel non. Mills v. Alabama, supra, teaches that where First Amendment rights are involved, compliance with procedural formalities before allowing their vindication in this Court is not necessary unless those procedures are meaningful. </p><p> I would follow Mills and grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and put the case down for argument. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> It does not appear that the respondent appealed from that portion of the municipal court\'s order suppressing the books which had not been specified in the warrant or which had been found not to be obscene.

Moreover, we believe that it serves the policy underlying the requirement of finality in 28 U.S.C. 1257 to determine now in which state court appellants may be tried rather than to subject them, and appellee, to long and complex litigation which may all be for naught if consideration of the preliminary question of venue is postponed until the conclusion of the proceedings.\' 371 U.S., at 558, 83 S.
