The state court rejected that claim after making a finding that the attorneys were advised by an expert that such investigation was unnecessary.  Under the governing federal statute, that factual finding is presumed correct unless any one of eight exceptions applies.  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(8) (1994 ed.).  But the Court of Appeals considered only one of those exceptions (specifically \xc2\xa72254(d)(8)).  And on that basis, it considered itself \xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound\xe2\x80\x9d to accept the state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding, and rejected Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Because the Court of Appeals did not fully consider several remaining potentially applicable exceptions, we vacate its judgment and remand.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When Jefferson was a child, he \xe2\x80\x9csuffered a serious injury to his head.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Terry, </em>490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1261, 1326 (ND Ga. 2007); see <em>id.,</em> at 1320 (quoting Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s mother\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that \xe2\x80\x9ca car ran over the top of his head\xe2\x80\x9d when he was two years old).  The accident left his skull swollen and misshapen and his forehead visibly scarred.  <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Hall, </em>570 F.\xc2\xa03d 1283, 1311, 1315, n.\xc2\xa04 (CA11 2009) (Carnes, J., dissenting).  During the District Court proceedings below, uncontroverted experts testified that, as a result of his head injury, Jefferson has \xe2\x80\x9cpermanent brain damage\xe2\x80\x9d that<em> </em>\xe2\x80\x9ccauses abnormal behavior\xe2\x80\x9d over which he \xe2\x80\x9chas no or substantially limited control.\xe2\x80\x9d  490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1321\xe2\x80\x931322.

But they testified he is neither psychotic nor retarded.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1319.  Thus, they said, to a lay observer or even to a professional psychologist, Jefferson does not outwardly appear mentally impaired.  Indeed, according to the experts, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the behavior that may result from\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d his condition \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98could, without the administration of proper testing, be mistaken for volitional.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson faced a death sentence for killing his co-worker while the two men were fishing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1271\xe2\x80\x931272.  Prior to trial, he was examined by a psychologist named Dr. Gary Dudley, who prepared a formal report in which he concluded that Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s mental deficiencies do not impair \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98his judgment or decision-making capacity.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1294 (quoting report).  But Dr. Dudley\xe2\x80\x99s report included a caveat: \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98One possibility that could not be explored because of [Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s] incarceration has to do with the sequelae,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e., </em>pathologies, related to a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98head injury experienced during childhood.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98In my opinion,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d he wrote, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98it would be worthwhile to conduct neuropsychological evaluation of this individual to rule out an organic etiology,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.,</em> to rule out brain damage.  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p><em>\n</em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although \xe2\x80\x9cit is undisputed that the testing\xe2\x80\x9d Dr. Dudley recommended \xe2\x80\x9ccould have easily been performed,\xe2\x80\x9d 490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1322, and that Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys possessed police reports and hospital records recounting his head injury, <em>id.,</em> at 1323, the attorneys did not have Jefferson tested.  At sentencing, they presented only testimony from two prison guards, who stated that Jefferson was an unproblematic inmate, and from three members of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s family, who testified that he is a \xe2\x80\x9cresponsible, generous, gentle, and kind\xe2\x80\x9d person and \xe2\x80\x9ca good father.\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1290\xe2\x80\x931291.  And while Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s mother briefly mentioned the car accident, \xe2\x80\x9cshe was not questioned and did not offer any testimony regarding the impact, if any, that the accident had on him.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1291.  Thus, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]s far as the jury knew, Jefferson did not suffer from brain damage or neurological impairment; he had no organic disorders\xe2\x80\x9d; and \xe2\x80\x9chis emotional stability, impulse control, and judgment were perfectly normal.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1311 (Carnes, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson sought habeas relief in state court, arguing that his two trial attorneys unreasonably failed to pursue brain-damage testing.  In response, the trial attorneys testified that they did not pursue such testing because, after delivering his formal written report, Dr. Dudley later told them that further investigation \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98may be a waste of time because the rest of [his] report\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d had \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98said that [Jefferson] was non psychotic.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1295 (quoting testimony).  Dr. Dudley did not testify in person at the hearing, but he submitted a sworn affidavit denying that he had ever made such statements.  He said \xe2\x80\x9cit had always been his expert opinion \xe2\x80\x98that neuropsychological testing was necessary\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that when he wrote as much in his formal report \xe2\x80\x9che \xe2\x80\x98meant it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1312 (Carnes, J., dissenting) (quoting affidavit).  He added, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98I never, before or after that report, suggested to [Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys] that such an evaluation was not necessary or that it would not be worthwhile.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.;</em> cf. Pet. for Cert. 17, n.\xc2\xa012.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson contends, and the State has not disputed, that after the hearing concluded the state-court judge contacted the attorneys for the State <em>ex parte.</em>  And in a private conversation that included neither Jefferson nor his attorneys, the judge asked the State\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys to draft the opinion of the court.  See <em>id.</em>, at 3, 12.  According to Jefferson, no such request was made of him, nor was he informed of the request made to opposing counsel.  <em>Id.,</em> at 12, n.\xc2\xa08, 13; see also <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, 263 Ga. 316, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 110, 111 (1993) (\xe2\x80\x9cJefferson contends [the order] amounts to no more and no less than a reply brief to which [he] has not had a chance to respond\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The attorneys for the State prepared an opinion finding that \xe2\x80\x9cDr. Dudley led [Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s trial attorneys] to believe that further investigation would simply be a waste of time because Petitioner [i]s not psychotic.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Zant</em>, Civ. Action No. 87\xe2\x80\x93V\xe2\x80\x931241 (Super. Ct. Butts Cty., Ga., Oct. 7, 1992), p.\xc2\xa016, App. 4 to Pet. for Cert. 16 (hereinafter State Order); see also <em>id.,</em> at 37.  The opinion \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically credits the testimony of [the trial attorneys] with regard to their efforts to investigate Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s mental condition.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 18; see also <em>id.,</em> at 36.  And relying on these findings, it concludes that Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cmade a reasonable investigation into [his] mental health\xe2\x80\x9d and were thus not ineffective.  <em>Id.,</em> at 37.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Notably, as the Georgia Supreme Court acknowledged, the State\xe2\x80\x99s opinion discusses statements purportedly made on Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s behalf by a witness \xe2\x80\x9cwho did not testify\xe2\x80\x9d or participate in the proceedings.  263 Ga., at 318, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 112; see State Order 24\xe2\x80\x9325.  Nonetheless, the opinion \xe2\x80\x9cwas adopted verbatim by the [state] court.\xe2\x80\x9d  263 Ga., at 316, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 111.  And while the State Supreme Court recognized that we have \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98criticized\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d such a practice, it affirmed the judgment.  <em>Id.,</em> at 317, 320, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 112, 114 (quoting <em>Anderson</em> v. <em>Bessemer City</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/index.html">470 U. S. 564</a>, 572 (1985)).</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson next sought federal habeas relief in the District Court.  In his opening brief, he argued that \xe2\x80\x9cthere is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Corpus Court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner in No. 1:96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93989\xe2\x80\x93CC (ND Ga.), Doc. 105, p.\xc2\xa04, and n.\xc2\xa01 (hereinafter District Court Brief).  In support of that argument, he claimed that the state court \xe2\x80\x9cmerely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word,\xe2\x80\x9d even though the order \xe2\x80\x9cdescribed witnesses who never testified.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>  And he said that such a process \xe2\x80\x9crais[es] serious doubts as to whether [the judge] even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court ruled in Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s favor.  It noted that under the relevant statute \xe2\x80\x9cfactual findings of state courts are presumed to be correct unless one of \xe2\x80\xa6 eight enumerated exceptions \xe2\x80\xa6 applies.\xe2\x80\x9d 490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d, at 1280; see also id.,</em> at 1280, n.\xc2\xa05 (listing the exceptions).

But it accepted Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s claim of ineffective assistance of counsel without disturbing the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings because it believed he should prevail even accepting those findings as true.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1324\xe2\x80\x931325.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Jefferson defended the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s judgment primarily on its own terms.  But he also argued that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factfinding was \xe2\x80\x9cdubious at best\xe2\x80\x9d in light of the process that court employed, and that the Court of Appeals therefore \xe2\x80\x9cshould harbor serious doubts about the findings of fact and credibility determinations in the state court record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner/Appellee in No. 07\xe2\x80\x9312502 (CA11), pp. 31\xe2\x80\x9332, n.\xc2\xa010 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A divided Court of Appeals panel reversed, and Jefferson filed this petition for certiorari asking us to review his claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.  And, in so doing, he challenges\xe2\x80\x94as he did in the State Supreme Court, the District Court, and the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe fact findings of the state court,\xe2\x80\x9d given what he describes as the deficient procedure employed by that court while reviewing his claim.

See, <em>e.g.,</em> Appeals Brief 32, n.\xc2\xa010; District Court Brief<em> </em>4, n.\xc2\xa01; Pet. for Cert. 12.  These are arguments that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>process</em> was deficient.  In other words, they are arguments that Jefferson \xe2\x80\x9cdid not receive a full and fair evidentiary hearing in \xe2\x80\xa6 state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Townsend, supra,</em> at 312.  Or, to use the statutory language, they are arguments that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cfactfinding procedure,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9chearing,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cproceeding\xe2\x80\x9d were not \xe2\x80\x9cfull, fair, and adequate.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), (7).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Court of Appeals did not consider the state court\xe2\x80\x99s process when it applied the statutory presumption of correctness.  Instead, it invoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of \xc2\xa72254(d), which, codifying the second <em>Townsend</em> exception, 372 U. S., at 313, lifts the presumption of correctness for findings that are \xe2\x80\x9cnot fairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1300 (quoting <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Herring</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa03d 1350, 1366 (CA11 1995), in turn quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(8)).  And even though the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x9crecognize[d]\xe2\x80\x9d that Jefferson had argued that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>process</em> had produced factual findings that were \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dubious at best,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that federal courts should therefore \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98harbor serious doubts about\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98findings of fact and credibility,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98entitled to a presumption of correctness\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that it was \xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound\xe2\x80\x9d to apply.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1304, n.\xc2\xa08 (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n.\xc2\xa010).  The Court of Appeals explicitly stated that it considered itself \xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound\xe2\x80\x9d to defer to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings because \xe2\x80\x9cJefferson has not argued that any of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings were \xe2\x80\x98<em>not fairly supported by the record</em>,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d a direct reference to \xc2\xa72254(d)(8) and to the second <em>Townsend</em> exception.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1304, n.\xc2\xa08 (emphasis added).  And it then concluded: \xe2\x80\x9cBased on these factual findings of the state habeas courts\xe2\x80\x94all of which are <em>fairly supported by the record</em>\xe2\x80\x94we believe that Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s counsel were reasonable in deciding not to pursue neuropsychological testing.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1304 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, the Court of Appeals did not properly consider the legal status of the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings.  Under <em>Townsend</em>, as codified by the governing statute, a federal court is not \xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound\xe2\x80\x9d to accept any and all state-court findings that are \xe2\x80\x9cfairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  Those words come from \xc2\xa72254(d)(8), which is only one of eight enumerated exceptions to the presumption of correctness.  But there are seven others, see \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(7), none of which the Court of Appeals considered when addressing Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  To be sure, we have previously stated in cases<em> applying </em>\xc2\xa72254(d)(8) that \xe2\x80\x9ca federal court\xe2\x80\x9d may not overturn a state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual conclusion \xe2\x80\x9cunless the conclusion is not \xe2\x80\x98fairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Dugger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/308/index.html">498 U. S. 308</a>, 320 (1991) (granting federal habeas relief after rejecting state court\xe2\x80\x99s finding under \xc2\xa72254(d)(8)); see also  <em>Demosthenes</em> v. <em>Baal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/731/index.html">495 U.

But in those cases there was no suggestion that any <em>other</em> provisions enumerated in \xc2\xa72254(d) were at issue.  That is not the case here.  In treating \xc2\xa72254(d)(8) as the <em>exclusive</em> statutory exception, and by failing to address Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s argument that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>procedures</em> deprived its findings of deference, the Court of Appeals applied the statute and our precedents incorrectly.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Although we have stated that a court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cverbatim adoption of findings of fact prepared by prevailing parties\xe2\x80\x9d should be treated as findings of the court, we have also criticized that practice.  <em>Anderson</em>, 470 U. S., at 572.  And we have not considered the lawfulness of, nor the application of the habeas statute to, the use of such a practice where (1) a judge solicits the proposed findings <em>ex parte</em>, (2) does not provide the opposing party an opportunity to criticize the findings or to submit his own, or (3) adopts findings that contain internal evidence suggesting that the judge may not have read them.  Cf. <em>id.,</em> at 568; Ga. Code of Judicial Conduct, Canon 3(A)(4) (1993) (prohibiting <em>ex parte </em>judicial communications).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We decline to determine in the first instance whether any of the exceptions enumerated in \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(8) apply in this case, see, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Cutter</em> v. <em>Wilkinson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/544/709/index.html">544 U. S. 709</a>, 718, n.\xc2\xa07 (2005), especially given that the facts surrounding the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s process are undeveloped.  Respondent has conceded that it drafted the state court\xe2\x80\x99s final order at that court\xe2\x80\x99s request and that the order was adopted verbatim, 263 Ga., at 317, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 111, and has not disputed in this Court that the state court solicited the order \xe2\x80\x9c<em>ex parte </em>and without prior notice\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cdid not seek a proposed order from Petitioner,\xe2\x80\x9d Pet. for Cert. 12, and n.\xc2\xa08.  But the precise nature of what transpired during the state-court proceedings is not fully known.  See 263 Ga. at 316\xe2\x80\x93317, 431 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 111 (noting dispute as to whether Jefferson \xe2\x80\x9chad a chance to respond\xe2\x80\x9d to the final order); see also Pet. for Cert. 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Accordingly, we believe it necessary for the lower courts to determine on remand whether the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings warrant a presumption of correctness, and to conduct any further proceedings as may be appropriate in light of their resolution of that issue.  See <em>Townsend, supra,</em> at 313\xe2\x80\x93319; <em>Keeney</em> v. <em>Tamayo-Reyes</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/index.html">504 U. S. 1</a> (1992).

In my view the Court should either answer that question or (as I would prefer) deny the petition.  Instead, it summarily vacates the judgment of the Court of Appeals on an altogether different ground that was neither raised nor passed upon below and that is not fairly included within the sole question presented.  To make matters worse, the Court conjures up an \xe2\x80\x9cerror\xe2\x80\x9d with respect to that ground by misquoting and mischaracterizing the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion, <em>ante</em>, at 9\xe2\x80\x9310, and by overlooking relevant authority from this Court.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The prior version of 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d) (1994 ed.) applicable in this case provided that in federal habeas proceedings the factual determinations of a state court \xe2\x80\x9cshall be presumed to be correct,\xe2\x80\x9d unless the applicant proves, the respondent admits, or a federal court determines that one of eight exceptions set forth in \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(8) applies.  The Court concludes that the Eleventh Circuit misapplied that provision and our precedents by treating one of those exceptions, \xc2\xa72254(d)(8), \xe2\x80\x9cas the <em>exclusive</em> statutory exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the presumption of correctness, and by failing to address whether \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), or (7) might also bar application of that presumption.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, however, is the first anyone (including Jefferson) has heard of this argument.  Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s briefs below contain no discussion or even citation of subsection (d)\xe2\x80\x94let alone of paragraphs (2), (6), or (7)\xe2\x80\x94and the courts below understandably never passed upon the application of those provisions.  Under our longstanding practice, that should be the end of the matter.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>Pennsylvania Dept. of Corrections</em> v. <em>Yeskey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/206/index.html">524 U. S. 206</a>, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1998).   </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But the Court insists, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 8\xe2\x80\x939, that if we squint at them long enough we can see in Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s briefs below a challenge to the state court\xe2\x80\x99s fact-finding process cognizable under \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), and (7).  But the handful of isolated, vague statements it musters (buried in hundreds of pages of briefs) show no such thing.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s only evidence that Jefferson presented the point to the District Court, <em>ante</em>, at 5, 8, consists of a single sentence of text (and an accompanying two-sentence footnote) in the \xe2\x80\x9cPrior Proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d section of his 180-page brief.  Final Evidentiary Brief and Proposed Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, Record in No. 1:96\xe2\x80\x93CV\xe2\x80\x93989\xe2\x80\x93CC (ND Ga.), Doc. 105 (hereinafter District Court Brief).  The sentence is: \xe2\x80\x9cIn entering the State Habeas Corpus Order Judge Newton merely signed an order drafted by the State without revision of a single word.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 4.  The footnote adds:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he order signed by Judge Newton described witnesses who never testified, raising serious doubt as to whether he even read, much less carefully considered, the proposed order submitted by the State.  In this circumstance, there is no reason under principles of comity or otherwise to give any deference to the findings of the State Habeas Court, because there was apparently no serious consideration or deliberation of the factual and legal issues raised.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em>, n.\xc2\xa01.</p>\n<p align="left">\nThis passing suggestion that deference would be unwarranted is, to put it mildly, an elliptical way to argue that the state fact-finding procedure was inadequate, \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), that Jefferson was denied a full, fair, and adequate hearing, \xc2\xa72254(d)(6), or that Jefferson was denied due process of law, \xc2\xa72254(d)(7).  And it only appeared, I emphasize again, in the \xe2\x80\x9cPrior Proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d section of the brief.  The <em>argument </em>section of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s District Court Brief, consisting of 164 pages and containing separate assignments of error from III to XLIV (44), makes no mention of the ground upon which the Court today relies.  And the assignment of error that is the basis for the question presented in Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s petition, VI, <em>id.,</em> at 47\xe2\x80\x9380, did not dispute the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings under \xc2\xa72254(d), but only challenged the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 legal conclusion that his attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 failure to conduct a fuller investigation into the head injury he suffered as a child was not deficient performance under <em>Strickland</em> v. <em>Washington</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/index.html">466 U. S. 668</a> (1984).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Jefferson also did not raise the point in the Eleventh Circuit.  His brief to that court acknowledged that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9c[f]indings of fact and credibility determinations are reviewed for clear error.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner/Appellee, No. 07\xe2\x80\x9312502, pp. 16\xe2\x80\x9317 (hereinafter Appeals Brief).  It declared that \xe2\x80\x9cThe District Court Correctly Deferred to the Fact Findings of the State Court\xe2\x80\x9d in adjudicating his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel claim.  <em>Id.,</em> at 21 (capitalization and boldface type deleted); see also <em>id.,</em> at 29, and n.\xc2\xa07, 31.  And it conceded that with respect to the ineffective-assistance claim, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he relevant facts are not in dispute.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 24.  Jefferson did characterize the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings as generally \xe2\x80\x9cdubious\xe2\x80\x9d and suggested there were \xe2\x80\x9cserious doubts\xe2\x80\x9d about them, <em>id.,</em> at 32, n.\xc2\xa010.  But not once did he argue that the dubiousness of the findings was the consequence of a failure to meet the requirements of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), or (7)\xe2\x80\x94or even more generally that the findings should not be presumed correct under \xc2\xa72254(d).  Instead, he pressed the same argument he made in the District Court: Even if the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings were correct, his trial attorneys rendered ineffective assistance in deciding to forgo further investigation of his childhood head injury.  <em>Id.,</em> at 31\xe2\x80\x9333, 50\xe2\x80\x9351.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Nor did the courts below pass upon the argument the Court now addresses.  The District Court did not dispute the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings.  <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Terry</em>, 490 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 1261, 1319\xe2\x80\x931320 (ND Ga. 2007).  It accepted those findings as true, including the state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s credibility findings, <em>id.,</em> at 1323\xe2\x80\x931324, and n.\xc2\xa017, but held \xe2\x80\x9cas a matter of law\xe2\x80\x9d that it was objectively unreasonable for Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys \xe2\x80\x9cnot to investigate\xe2\x80\x9d further into the effect, if any, of the accident on Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s mental capacity and health, <em>id.,</em> at 1324.  Concluding that Jefferson was thereby prejudiced, the court ordered a new sentencing hearing.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1328.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals disagreed with that determination and reversed, holding that his trial attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 performance was not objectively unreasonable under <em>Strickland</em>.  <em>Jefferson</em> v. <em>Hall</em>, 570 F.\xc2\xa03d 1283, 1301\xe2\x80\x931309 (CA11 2009).  That court correctly stated the applicable framework under \xc2\xa72254(d):</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cPre-AEDPA, questions of law and mixed questions of law and fact resolved by state habeas courts are reviewed <em>de novo</em>, while the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings are \xe2\x80\x98subject to the presumption of correctness.\xe2\x80\x99  <em>Freund</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Butterworth</em>, 165 F.\xc2\xa03d 839, 861 (11th Cir. 1999).  Although these findings may be disregarded <em>if, for example, </em>they are not \xe2\x80\x98fairly supported by the record,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Jackson</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Herring</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa03d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(8)), this Court has construed the \xe2\x80\x98presumption of correctness\xe2\x80\x99 standard to be the same as the \xe2\x80\x98clear error\xe2\x80\x99 standard of review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1300 (emphasis added; footnote omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\nConfronted with no argument that \xc2\xa72254(d)(1)\xe2\x80\x93(7) applied or that it must disregard the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings, the Court of Appeals understandably did not pass upon those questions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals did consider the record on its own, as required by \xc2\xa72254(d)(8), to determine whether the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual determinations were fairly supported by the record.  <em>Id.,</em> at 1303\xe2\x80\x931304, and n. 8.  In doing so, the court \xe2\x80\x9cspecifically note[d] that neither Jefferson nor the district court questioned the state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual finding that [the defense\xe2\x80\x99s psychiatric expert] led [one of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorney\xe2\x80\x99s] to believe that further investigation <em>would</em> simply be a waste of time, . . . despite [his attorney\xe2\x80\x99s] testimony that [the expert] told him it \xe2\x80\x98may\xe2\x80\x99 be a waste of time.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 1303, n.\xc2\xa08.

The dissent did not cite \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but instead focused on the  same question of constitutional law that occupied Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s briefs, the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, and the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion: whether, accepting the factual findings and credibility determination of the state courts as true, Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys rendered ineffective assistance of counsel.  <em>That</em> is only the question that occupied the courts and the parties below.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is bad enough that the Court decides an issue not raised or resolved in the lower courts.

The statutory question may be \xe2\x80\x9c<em>related</em> to,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps <em>complementary</em> to the one petitioner presented,\xe2\x80\x9d but it is not \xe2\x80\x9cfairly included therein.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Yee</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 537 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0As for the body of Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s petition: Far from invoking \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s exceptions to the presumption of correctness to support the Sixth Amendment claim, the petition does not even mention<em> </em>subsection (d), let alone paragraphs (2), (6), or (7).  There is <em>no</em> argument, <em>anywhere</em> in the section entitled \xe2\x80\x9cReasons for Granting the Writ,\xe2\x80\x9d that the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings are not entitled to a presumption of correctness.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court<em> </em>claims, <em>ante</em>, at 6, that Jefferson sufficiently presented the statutory issue by his characterizations of the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings in the \xe2\x80\x9cStatement of the Case\xe2\x80\x9d section of his petition, see Pet. for Cert. 11\xe2\x80\x9313, 17, n.\xc2\xa012, 18, n.\xc2\xa013.  Even if that were so, \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the fact that [petitioner] discussed this issue in the text of [his] petition for certiorari does not bring it before us.  Rule 14.1(a) requires that a subsidiary question be fairly included in the <em>question presented</em> for our review.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Wood</em> v. <em>Allen</em>, 558 U.

They contain no argument that \xc2\xa72254(d)\xe2\x80\x99s presumption is inapplicable because of \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), but merely describe the proceedings below, see Pet. for Cert. 11\xe2\x80\x9313, and assert that there might be reasons to doubt the state-court findings (but for the \xc2\xa72254(d) presumption), see <em>id.,</em> at 17, n.\xc2\xa012, 18, n. 13.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cThe premise of our adversarial system is that appellate courts do not sit as self-directed boards of legal inquiry and research, but essentially as arbiters of legal questions presented and argued by the parties before them.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Carducci</em> v. <em>Regan</em>, 714 F.\xc2\xa02d 171, 177 (CADC 1983) (opinion of Scalia, J.).  Our refusal to abide by standard rules of appellate practice is unfair to the Eleventh Circuit, whose judgment the Court vacates, and especially to the respondent here, who suffers a loss in this Court without<em> ever</em> having an opportunity to address the merits of the statutory question the Court decides.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approach would be objectionable even if it were correct that the Court of Appeals went astray.  But it is not.  The Court of Appeals did <em>not</em> treat \xc2\xa72254(d)(8) as \xe2\x80\x9cthe <em>exclusive</em> statutory exception\xe2\x80\x9d to the presumption of correctness.  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  It is true that the majority\xe2\x80\x99s opinion\xe2\x80\x94as well as the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x94discussed only \xc2\xa72254(d)(8).  But that is because only \xc2\xa72254(d)(8), and not \xc2\xa72254(d)(2), (6), or (7), was ever brought to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention.  On the fair reading we owe the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, there simply was no error in its application of \xc2\xa72254(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asserts, however, that the Eleventh Circuit  ignored the other seven paragraphs in \xc2\xa72254(d) when it \xe2\x80\x9cinvoked Circuit precedent that applied only paragraph (8) of \xc2\xa72254(d).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.  It did nothing of the sort.  The Court of Appeals said that a state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings \xe2\x80\x9cmay be disregarded <em>if, for example, </em>they are not \xe2\x80\x98fairly supported by the record,\xe2\x80\x99 <em>Jackson</em> <em>v.</em> <em>Herring</em>, 42 F.\xc2\xa03d 1350, 1366 (11th Cir. 1995) (quoting 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(8)).\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1300 (emphasis added).  The Court of Appeals thus expressly acknowledged that \xc2\xa72254(d)(8) was <em>but one example</em> of the grounds for disregarding a state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings.  And the Circuit precedent it cited, <em>Jackson</em> v. <em>Herring</em>, similarly did not imply, much less hold,<em> </em>that \xc2\xa72254(d)(8) provided the only grounds for setting aside a state court\xe2\x80\x99s factual findings under \xc2\xa72254(d).  See 42 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1366.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Next, the Court<em> </em>states:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAnd even though the Court of Appeals \xe2\x80\x98recognize[d]\xe2\x80\x99 that Jefferson had argued that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s <em>process</em> had produced factual findings that were \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cdubious at best,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 and that federal courts should therefore \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9charbor serious doubts about\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 the state court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cfindings of fact and credibility,\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 the Court of Appeals nonetheless held that the state court\xe2\x80\x99s findings are \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9centitled to a presumption of correctness\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 that it was \xe2\x80\x98\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99 to apply.  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1304, n.\xc2\xa08 (quoting Appeals Brief 32, n.\xc2\xa010).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 9.</p>\n<p align="left">\nAgain, the Court has plucked isolated language from here and there in the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 opinion, to produce a reading which suggests that the Court of Appeals agreed with, or at least did not contest, Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s claim of \xe2\x80\x9cserious doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  That is not so.  In the <em>first</em> paragraph of footnote eight of its opinion, the panel reasoned that it was \xe2\x80\x9cduty-bound to accept\xe2\x80\x9d the state courts\xe2\x80\x99 factual findings because it concluded they \xe2\x80\x9care clear, unambiguous, and fairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x9d  570 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1303\xe2\x80\x931304, n.\xc2\xa08.  That language precedes the panel\xe2\x80\x99s analysis\xe2\x80\x94in the <em>second</em> paragraph of footnote eight\xe2\x80\x94regarding Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s statements that the findings were \xe2\x80\x9cdubious\xe2\x80\x9d and raised \xe2\x80\x9cserious doubts.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Court<em> </em>omits the panel\xe2\x80\x99s <em>actual</em> explanation for declining to credit Jefferson\xe2\x80\x99s general characterization of the quality of the record, which is: \xe2\x80\x9cJefferson does not point to any particular factual finding that was clearly erroneous, and Jefferson even says in the argument section of his brief that, \xe2\x80\x98[t]he relevant facts are not in dispute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Id.,</em> at 1304, n.\xc2\xa08.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0By the way, even if the Court of Appeals had carelessly described application of the pre-AEDPA version of \xc2\xa72254(d) in the manner which the Court suggests, that would have been no worse than what we have done.  For example, in <em>Demosthenes</em> v. <em>Baal</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/495/731/index.html">495 U. S. 731</a>, 735 (1990) <em>(per curiam)</em>, we stated that a federal court may not overturn a state habeas court\xe2\x80\x99s factual determinations \xe2\x80\x9cunless it concludes that they are not \xe2\x80\x98fairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x99  See 28 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72254(d)(8).\xe2\x80\x9d  And in <em>Parker</em> v. <em>Dugger</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/498/308/index.html">498 U. S. 308</a>, 320 (1991), we explained that a federal habeas court \xe2\x80\x9cis not to overturn a factual conclusion of a state court, including a state appellate court, unless the conclusion is not \xe2\x80\x98fairly supported by the record.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Generally speaking, we have no power to set aside the duly entered judgment of a lower federal court unless we find it to have been in error.  More specifically, except where there has been an intervening legal development (such as a subsequently announced opinion of ours) that might alter the judgment below, we cannot <em>grant </em>a petition for certiorari, <em>vacate </em>the judgment below, and <em>remand </em>the case (GVR) simply to obtain a re-do.  <em>Webster</em> v. <em>Cooper</em>, 558 U. S. ___, ___ (2009) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (slip op., at 3).  Yet today the Court vacates the judgment of the Eleventh Circuit on the basis of an error that court did not commit, with respect to a statutory issue that had never previously been raised, and remands for more extensive consideration of a new argument that <em>might </em>affect the judgment.  Under the taxonomy of our increasingly unprincipled GVR practice, this creature is of the same genus as the \xe2\x80\x9cSummary Remand for a More Extensive Opinion than Petitioner Requested\xe2\x80\x9d (SRMEOPR).  <em>Id.,</em> at ___ (slip op., at 4).
