Both suits were pursued in Montana state courts although the injured workers did not reside in Montana, nor were they injured there.  The defendant railroad, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), although \xe2\x80\x9cdoing business\xe2\x80\x9d in Montana when the litigation commenced, was not incorporated in Montana, nor did it maintain its principal place of business in that State.  To justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over BNSF, the Montana Supreme Court relied on \xc2\xa756, which provides in relevant part:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cUnder this chapter an action may be brought in a district court of the United States, in the district of the residence of the defendant, or in which the cause of action arose, or in which the defendant shall be doing business at the time of commencing such action.

The provision\xe2\x80\x99s second relevant sentence, using the term \xe2\x80\x9cconcurrent\xe2\x80\x9d jurisdiction, refers to subject-matter jurisdiction, not personal jurisdiction.

Montana.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mont. Rule Civ. Proc. 4(b)(1) (2015).  BNSF fit that bill, the court stated, because it has over 2,000 miles of railroad track and employs more than 2,000 workers in Montana.  Our precedent, however, explains that the\n \nFourteenth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s Due Process Clause does not permit a State to hale an out-of-state corporation before its courts when the corporation is not \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d in the State and theepisode-in-suit occurred elsewhere.  <i>Daimler AG</i> v. <i>Bauman</i>, 571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 8) (internal quotation marks omitted).

As earlier noted, BNSF has over 2,000 miles of railroad track and more than 2,000 employees in Montana.

But my agreement with the majority ends there.  I continue to disagree with the path the Court struck in <i>Daimler AG</i> v. <i>Bauman, </i>571 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2014), which limits general jurisdiction over a corporate defendant only to those States where it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98essentially at home,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at ___ (slip op., at 8).

Accordingly, I join Parts I and II of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, but dissent from Part III and the judgment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Court would do well to adhere more faithfully to the direction from <i>International Shoe Co. </i>v.<i> Washington</i>, 326 U.\xc2\xa0S. 310 (1945), which instructed that general jurisdiction is proper when a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous corporate operations within a state [are] so substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against it on causes of action arising from dealings entirely distinct from those activities.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id</i>., at 318.  Under <i>International Shoe</i>, in other words, courts were to ask whether the benefits a defendant attained in the forum State warranted the burdens associated with general personal jurisdiction.  See <i>id.</i>, at 317\xe2\x80\x93318.  The majority itself acknowledges that <i>International Shoe</i> should govern, describing the question as whether a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s affiliations with a State are sufficiently \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98continuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d to warrant the exercise of general jurisdiction there.  <i>Ante,</i> at 10.  If only its analysis today reflected that directive.  Instead, the majority opinion goes on to reaffirm the restrictive \xe2\x80\x9cat home\xe2\x80\x9d test set out in <i>Daimler\xe2\x80\x94</i>a test that, as I have explained, has no home in our precedents and creates serious inequities. See 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Sotomayor, J., concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 8\xe2\x80\x9319).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach grants a jurisdictional windfall to large multistate or multinational corporations that operate across many jurisdictions.  Under its reasoning, it is virtually inconceivable that such corporations will ever be subject to general jurisdiction in any location other than their principal places of business or of incorporation.  Foreign businesses with principal places of business outside the United States may never be subject to general jurisdiction in this country even though they have continuous and systematic contacts within the United States.  See <i>id.</i>, at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 17\xe2\x80\x9318).  What was once a holistic, nuanced contacts analysis backed by considerations of fairness and reasonableness has now effectively been replaced by the rote identification of a corporation\xe2\x80\x99s principal place of business or place of incorporation.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  The result?  It is individual plaintiffs, harmed by the actionsof a farflung foreign corporation, who will bear the brunt of the majority\xe2\x80\x99s approach and be forced to sue in dis-tant jurisdictions with which they have no contacts or connection.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Moreover, the comparative contacts analysis invented in <i>Daimler</i> resurfaces here and proves all but dispositive. The majority makes much of the fact that BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s contacts in Montana are only a percentage of its contacts with other jurisdictions.  <i>Ante</i>, at 3, 11.<i> </i>But <i>International Shoe</i>, which the majority agrees is the springboard for our modern personal jurisdiction jurisprudence, <i>ante,</i> at 9, applied no comparative contacts test.  There the Court analyzed whether the Delaware corporation had \xe2\x80\x9cby its activities in the State of Washington rendered itself amenable to proceedings\xe2\x80\x9d in the State.  326 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 311.  The Court evaluated whether the corporation had offices in the forum State, made contracts there, delivered goods there, or employed salesmen there.  See <i>id.</i>, at 313.  Despite acknowledging that the corporation maintained places of business in several States, <i>ibid.</i>, the Court did not engage in a comparison between International Shoe\xe2\x80\x99s contacts within the State of Washington and the other States in which it operated.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The Court noted that the corporation employed 11 to 13 salesmen in Washington but did not query how that number compared to the number of salesmen in other States.  <i>Ibid.</i>  As well it should not have; the relative percentage of contacts is irrelevant.  The focus should be on the quality and quantity of the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s contacts in the forum State.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The majority does even <i>Daimler</i> itself a disservice, paying only lipservice to the question the Court purported to reserve there\xe2\x80\x94the possibility of an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional case\xe2\x80\x9d in which general jurisdiction would be proper in a forum State that is neither a corporate defendant\xe2\x80\x99s place of incorporation nor its principal place of business.  See 571 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, n. 19 (slip op., at 20, n.\xc2\xa019).  Its opinion here could be understood to limit that exception to the exact facts of <i>Perkins</i> v. <i>Benguet Consol. Mining Co.</i>,\n\n342 U.\xc2\xa0S. 437 (1952)\n.  See <i>ante</i>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9311.  That reading is so narrow as to read the exception out of existence entirely; certainly a defendant with significant contacts with more than one State falls outside its ambit.  And so it is inevitable under its own reasoning that the majority would conclude that BNSF\xe2\x80\x99s contacts with Montana are insufficient to justify the exercise of personal jurisdiction here.  This result is perverse.  Despite having reserved the possibility of an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional case\xe2\x80\x9d in <i>Daimler</i>, the majority here has re-jected that possibility out of hand.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Worse, the majority reaches its conclusion only by departing from the Court\xe2\x80\x99s normal practice.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>]  Had it remanded to the Montana Supreme Court to reevaluate the due process question under the correct legal standard, that court could have examined whether this is such an \xe2\x80\x9cexceptional case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Instead, with its ruling today, the Court unnecessarily sends a signal to the lower courtsthat the exceptional-circumstances inquiry is all form, no substance.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0As many commentators have observed, lower courts adhered to the continuous-and-systematic standard for decades before <i>Daimler</i>, and its predecessor <i>Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.\xc2\xa0A.</i> v. <i>Brown</i>,\n\n564 U.\xc2\xa0S. 915 (2011)\n, wrought the present sea change.

But the majority\xe2\x80\x99s view of <i>International Shoe</i> is overly restrictive.  The terms \xe2\x80\x9cspecific jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cgeneral jurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d are nowhere to be found in that opinion.  And I continue to believe, as I noted in <i>Daimler</i>, that there is no material difference between the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous and systematic\xe2\x80\x9d terminology <i>International Shoe</i> used for what we now call specific jurisdiction and the \xe2\x80\x9ccontinuous\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d terminology it used for what we now call general jurisdiction.
