Ledbetter submitted a questionnaire to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998 and a formal EEOC charge in July 1998.  After her November 1998 retirement, she filed suit, asserting, among other things, a sex discrimination claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The District Court<em> </em>allowed her Title VII pay discrimination claim to proceed to trial.  There, Ledbetter alleged that several supervisors had in the past given her poor evaluations because of her sex; that as a result, her pay had not increased as much as it would have if she had been evaluated fairly; that those past pay decisions affected the amount of her pay throughout her employment; and that by the end of her employment, she was earning significantly less than her male colleagues.  Goodyear maintained that the evaluations had been nondiscriminatory, but the jury found for Ledbetter, awarding backpay and damages.  On appeal, Goodyear contended that the pay discrimination claim was time barred with regard to all pay decisions made before September 26, 1997\xe2\x80\x94180 days before Ledbetter filed her EEOC questionnaire\xe2\x80\x94and that no discriminatory act relating to her pay occurred after that date.  The Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a Title VII pay discrimination claim cannot be based on allegedly discriminatory events that occurred before the last pay decision that affected the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pay during the EEOC charging period, and concluding that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Goodyear had acted with discriminatory intent in making the only two pay decisions during that period, denials of raises in 1997 and 1998.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:\xc2\xa0</em>Because the later effects of past discrimination do not restart the clock for filing an EEOC charge, Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claim is untimely.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1).  In addressing the issue of an EEOC charge\xe2\x80\x99s timeliness, this Court has stressed the need to identify with care the specific employment practice at issue.  Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s arguments\xe2\x80\x94that the paychecks that she received during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and triggered a new EEOC charging period\xe2\x80\x94fail because they would require the Court in effect to jettison the defining element of the disparate-treatment claim on which her Title VII recovery was based, discriminatory intent.  <em>United Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/553/index.html">431 U.

A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.  But if an employer engages in a series of separately actionable intentionally discriminatory acts, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed.  Ledbetter makes no claim that intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or that discriminatory decisions occurring before that period were not communicated to her.  She argues simply that Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s nondiscriminatory conduct during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period.  But current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination.  Ledbetter should have filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory employment decision was made and communicated to her.  Her attempt to shift forward the intent associated with prior discriminatory acts to the 1998 pay decision is unsound, for it would shift intent away from the act that consummated the discriminatory employment practice to a later act not performed with bias or discriminatory motive, imposing liability in the absence of the requisite intent.  Her argument would also distort Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cintegrated, multistep enforcement procedure.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Occidental Life Ins.

Bazemore</em>\xe2\x80\x99s rule is that an employer violates Title VII and triggers a new EEOC charging period whenever the employer issues paychecks using a discriminatory pay structure.  It is not, as Ledbetter contends, a \xe2\x80\x9cpaycheck accrual rule\xe2\x80\x9d under which each paycheck, even if not accompanied by discriminatory intent, triggers a new EEOC charging period during which the complainant may properly challenge any prior discriminatory conduct that impacted that paycheck\xe2\x80\x99s amount, no matter how long ago the discrimination occurred.

We have previously held that the time for filing a charge of employment discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) begins when the discriminatory act occurs.  We have explained that this rule applies to any \xe2\x80\x9c[d]iscrete ac[t]\xe2\x80\x9d of discrimination, including discrimination in \xe2\x80\x9ctermination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, [and] refusal to hire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/101/index.html">536 U. S. 101</a>, 114 (2002).  Because a pay-setting decision is a \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete act,\xe2\x80\x9d it follows that the period for filing an EEOC charge begins when the act occurs.  Petitioner, having abandoned her claim under the Equal Pay Act, asks us to deviate from our prior decisions in order to permit her to assert her claim under Title VII.  Petitioner also contends that discrimination in pay is different from other types of employment discrimination and thus should be governed by a different rule.  But because a pay-setting decision is a discrete act that occurs at a particular point in time, these arguments must be rejected.  We therefore affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Petitioner Lilly Ledbetter (Ledbetter) worked for respondent Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company (Goodyear) at its Gadsden, Alabama, plant from 1979 until 1998.  During much of this time, salaried employees at the plant were given or denied raises based on their supervisors\xe2\x80\x99 evaluation of their performance.  In March 1998, Ledbetter submitted a questionnaire to the EEOC alleging certain acts of sex discrimination, and in July of that year she filed a formal EEOC charge.  After taking early retirement in November 1998, Ledbetter commenced this action, in which she asserted, among other claims, a Title VII pay discrimination claim and a claim under the Equal Pay Act of 1963 (EPA), 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7206(d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The District Court granted summary judgment in favor of Goodyear on several of Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claims, including her Equal Pay Act claim, but allowed others, including her Title VII pay discrimination claim, to proceed to trial.  In support of this latter claim, Ledbetter introduced evidence that during the course of her employment several supervisors had given her poor evaluations because of her sex, that as a result of these evaluations her pay was not increased as much as it would have been if she had been evaluated fairly, and that these past pay decisions continued to affect the amount of her pay throughout her employment.  Toward the end of her time with Goodyear, she was being paid significantly less than any of her male colleagues.  Goodyear maintained that the evaluations had been nondiscriminatory, but the jury found for Ledbetter and awarded her backpay and damages.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On appeal, Goodyear contended that Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s pay discrimination claim was time barred with respect to all pay decisions made prior to September 26, 1997\xe2\x80\x94that is, 180 days before the filing of her EEOC questionnaire.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  And Goodyear argued that no discriminatory act relating to Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s pay occurred after that date.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed, holding that a Title VII pay discrimination claim cannot be based on any pay decision that occurred prior to the last pay decision that affected the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pay during the EEOC charging period.  421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169, 1182\xe2\x80\x931183 (2005).  The Court of Appeals then concluded that there was insufficient evidence to prove that Goodyear had acted with discriminatory intent in making the only two pay decisions that occurred within that time span, namely, a decision made in 1997 to deny Ledbetter a raise and a similar decision made in 1998.  <em>Id.</em>, at 1186\xe2\x80\x931187.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter filed a petition for a writ of certiorari but did not seek review of the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 holdings regarding the sufficiency of the evidence in relation to the 1997 and 1998 pay decisions.  Rather, she sought review of the following question:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhether and under what circumstances a plaintiff may bring an action under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 alleging illegal pay discrimination when the disparate pay is received during the statutory limitations period, but is the result of intentionally discriminatory pay decisions that occurred outside the limitations period.\xe2\x80\x9d  Pet. for Cert. i.</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn light of disagreement among the Courts of Appeals as to the proper application of the limitations period in Title VII disparate-treatment pay cases, compare<em> </em>421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169, with <em>Forsyth</em> v. <em>Federation Employment &amp; Guidance Serv.</em>, 409 F.\xc2\xa03d 565 (CA2 2005); <em>Shea</em> v. <em>Rice</em>, 409 F.\xc2\xa03d 448 (CADC 2005), we granted certiorari, 548 U.

Such a charge must be filed within a specified period (either 180 or 300 days, depending on the State) \xe2\x80\x9cafter the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.</em>, and if the employee does not submit a timely EEOC charge, the employee may not challenge that practice in court, \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addressing the issue whether an EEOC charge was filed on time, we have stressed the need to identify with care the specific employment practice that is at issue.  <em>Morgan</em>, 536 U. S., at 110\xe2\x80\x93111.  Ledbetter points to two different employment practices as possible candidates.  Primarily, she urges us to focus on the paychecks that were issued to her during the EEOC charging period (the 180-day period preceding the filing of her EEOC questionnaire), each of which, she contends, was a separate act of discrimination.  Alternatively, Ledbetter directs us to the 1998 decision denying her a raise, and she argues that this decision was \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful because it carried forward intentionally discriminatory disparities from prior years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Reply Brief for Petitioner 20.  Both of these arguments fail because they would require us in effect to jettison the defining element of the legal claim on which her Title VII recovery was based.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter asserted disparate treatment, the central element of which is discriminatory intent.  See <em>Chardon </em>v<em>. Fernandez</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/454/6/index.html">454 U. S. 6</a>, 8 (1981) <em>(per curiam);</em> <em>Teamsters </em>v<em>.

However, Ledbetter does not assert that the relevant Goodyear decisionmakers acted with actual discriminatory intent either when they issued her checks during the EEOC charging period or when they denied her a raise in 1998.  Rather, she argues that the paychecks were unlawful because they would have been larger if she had been evaluated in a nondiscriminatory manner <em>prior to</em> the EEOC charging period.  Brief for Petitioner 22.  Similarly, she maintains that the 1998 decision was unlawful because it \xe2\x80\x9ccarried forward\xe2\x80\x9d the effects of prior, uncharged discrimination decisions.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 20.  In essence, she suggests that it is sufficient that discriminatory acts that occurred prior to the charging period had continuing effects during that period.  Brief for Petitioner 13 (\xe2\x80\x9c[E]ach paycheck that offers a woman less pay than a similarly situated man because of her sex is a separate violation of Title VII with its own limitations period, regardless of whether the paycheck simply implements a prior discriminatory decision made outside the limitations period\xe2\x80\x9d); see also Reply Brief for Petitioner 20.  This argument is squarely foreclosed by our precedents.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>United Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/553/index.html">431 U. S. 553</a> (1977), we rejected an argument that is basically the same as Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s.  Evans was forced to resign because the airline refused to employ married flight attendants, but she did not file an EEOC charge regarding her termination.  Some years later, the airline rehired her but treated her as a new employee for seniority purposes.  <em>Id.</em>, at 554\xe2\x80\x93555.  Evans then sued, arguing that, while any suit based on the original discrimination was time barred, the airline\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to give her credit for her prior service gave \xe2\x80\x9cpresent effect to [its] past illegal act and thereby perpetuate[d] the consequences of forbidden discrimination.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 557.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We agreed with Evans that the airline\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cseniority system [did] indeed have a continuing impact on her pay and fringe benefits,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id., </em>at 558, but we noted that \xe2\x80\x9cthe critical question [was] whether any present <em>violation</em> exist[ed].\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (emphasis in original).  We concluded that the continuing effects of the precharging period discrimination did not make out a present violation.  As Justice Stevens wrote for the Court:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cUnited was entitled to treat [Evans\xe2\x80\x99 termination] as lawful after respondent failed to file a charge of discrimination within the 90 days then allowed by \xc2\xa7706(d).  A discriminatory act which is not made the basis for a timely charge \xe2\x80\xa6 is merely an unfortunate event in history which has no present legal consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em></p><em>\n<p align="left">\nIt would be difficult to speak to the point more directly.</p>\n</em><p><em>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Equally instructive is Delaware State College</em> v. <em>Ricks</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/449/250/index.html">449 U. S. 250</a> (1980), which concerned a college librarian, Ricks, who alleged that he had been discharged because of race.  In March 1974, Ricks was denied tenure, but he was given a final, nonrenewable one-year contract that expired on June 30, 1975.  <em>Id.</em>, at 252\xe2\x80\x93253.  Ricks delayed filing a charge with the EEOC until April 1975, <em>id.</em>, at 254, but he argued that the EEOC charging period ran from the date of his actual termination rather than from the date when tenure was denied.  In rejecting this argument, we recognized that \xe2\x80\x9cone of the <em>effects</em> of the denial of tenure,\xe2\x80\x9d namely, his ultimate termination, \xe2\x80\x9cdid not occur until later.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 258 (emphasis in original).  But because Ricks failed to identify any specific discriminatory act \xe2\x80\x9cthat continued until, or occurred at the time of, the actual termination of his employment,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id.</em>, at 257, we held that the EEOC charging period ran from \xe2\x80\x9cthe time the tenure decision was made and communicated to Ricks,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>id</em>., at 258.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This same approach dictated the outcome in <em>Lorance</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Technologies, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/490/900/index.html">490 U. S. 900</a> (1989), which grew out of a change in the way in which seniority was calculated under a collective-bargaining agreement.  Before 1979, all employees at the plant in question accrued seniority based simply on years of employment at the plant.  In 1979, a new agreement made seniority for workers in the more highly paid (and traditionally male) position of \xe2\x80\x9ctester\xe2\x80\x9d depend on time spent in that position alone and not in other positions in the plant.  Several years later, when female testers were laid off due to low seniority as calculated under the new provision, they filed an EEOC charge alleging that the 1979 scheme had been adopted with discriminatory intent, namely, to protect incumbent male testers when women with substantial plant seniority began to move into the traditionally male tester positions.  <em>Id.</em>, at 902\xe2\x80\x93903.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We held that the plaintiffs\xe2\x80\x99 EEOC charge was not timely because it was not filed within the specified period after the adoption in 1979 of the new seniority rule.  We noted that the plaintiffs had not alleged that the new seniority rule treated men and women differently or that the rule had been applied in a discriminatory manner.  Rather, their complaint was that the rule was adopted originally with discriminatory intent.  <em>Id.</em>, at 905.  And as in <em>Evans</em> and <em>Ricks</em>, we held that the EEOC charging period ran from the time when the discrete act of alleged intentional discrimination occurred, not from the date when the effects of this practice were felt.  490 U. S., at 907\xe2\x80\x93908.  We stated:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the claimed invalidity of the facially nondiscriminatory and neutrally applied tester seniority system is wholly dependent on the alleged illegality of signing the underlying agreement, it is the date of that signing which governs the limitations period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 911.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our most recent decision in this area confirms this understanding.  In <em>Morgan</em>, we explained that the statutory term \xe2\x80\x9cemployment practice\xe2\x80\x9d generally refers to \xe2\x80\x9ca discrete act or single \xe2\x80\x98occurrence\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that takes place at a particular point in time.  536 U.

We pointed to \xe2\x80\x9ctermination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, [and] refusal to hire\xe2\x80\x9d as examples of such \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete\xe2\x80\x9d acts, and we held that a Title VII plaintiff \xe2\x80\x9ccan only file a charge to cover discrete acts that \xe2\x80\x98occurred\xe2\x80\x99 within the appropriate time period.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 114.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The instruction provided by <em>Evans</em>, <em>Ricks</em>, <em>Lorance</em>, and <em>Morgan</em> is clear.  The EEOC charging period is triggered when a discrete unlawful practice takes place.  A new violation does not occur, and a new charging period does not commence, upon the occurrence of subsequent nondiscriminatory acts that entail adverse effects resulting from the past discrimination.  But of course, if an employer engages in a series of acts each of which is intentionally discriminatory, then a fresh violation takes place when each act is committed.  See <em>Morgan</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s arguments here\xe2\x80\x94that the paychecks that she received during the charging period and the 1998 raise denial each violated Title VII and triggered a new EEOC charging period\xe2\x80\x94cannot be reconciled with <em>Evans</em>, <em>Ricks</em>, <em>Lorance</em>, and <em>Morgan</em>.  Ledbetter, as noted, makes no claim that intentionally discriminatory conduct occurred during the charging period or that discriminatory decisions that occurred prior to that period were not communicated to her.  Instead, she argues simply that Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s conduct during the charging period gave present effect to discriminatory conduct outside of that period.  Brief for Petitioner 13.  But current effects alone cannot breathe life into prior, uncharged discrimination; as we held in <em>Evans</em>, such effects in themselves have \xe2\x80\x9cno present legal consequences.\xe2\x80\x9d  431 U. S., at 558.  Ledbetter should have filed an EEOC charge within 180 days after each allegedly discriminatory pay decision was made and communicated to her.  She did not do so, and the paychecks that were issued to her during the 180 days prior to the filing of her EEOC charge do not provide a basis for overcoming that prior failure.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In an effort to circumvent the need to prove discriminatory intent during the charging period, Ledbetter relies on the intent associated with other decisions made by other persons at other times.  Reply Brief for Petitioner 6 (\xe2\x80\x9cIntentional discrimination \xe2\x80\xa6 occurs when \xe2\x80\xa6 differential treatment takes place, even if the intent to engage in that conduct for a discriminatory purpose was made previously\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to take the intent associated with the prior pay decisions and shift it to the 1998 pay decision is unsound.  It would shift intent from one act (the act that consummates the discriminatory employment practice) to a later act that was not performed with bias or discriminatory motive.  The effect of this shift would be to impose liability in the absence of the requisite intent.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our cases recognize this point.  In <em>Evans</em>, for example, we did not take the airline\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory intent in 1968, when it discharged the plaintiff because of her sex, and attach that intent to its later act of neutrally applying its seniority rules.  Similarly, in <em>Ricks</em>, we did not take the discriminatory intent that the college allegedly possessed when it denied Ricks tenure and attach that intent to its subsequent act of terminating his employment when his nonrenewable contract ran out.  On the contrary, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\xe2\x80\x94and the filing limitations periods therefore commenced\xe2\x80\x94at the time the tenure decision was made and communicated to Ricks.\xe2\x80\x9d  449 U.

Nothing in Title VII supports treating the intent element of Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claim any differently from the employment practice element.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  If anything, concerns regarding stale claims weigh more heavily with respect to proof of the intent associated with employment practices than with the practices themselves.  For example, in a case such as this in which the plaintiff\xe2\x80\x99s claim concerns the denial of raises, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s challenged acts (the decisions not to increase the employee\xe2\x80\x99s pay at the times in question) will almost always be documented and will typically not even be in dispute.  By contrast, the employer\xe2\x80\x99s intent is almost always disputed, and evidence relating to intent may fade quickly with time.  In most disparate-treatment cases, much if not all of the evidence of intent is circumstantial.  Thus, the critical issue in a case involving a long-past performance evaluation will often be whether the evaluation was so far off the mark that a sufficient inference of discriminatory intent can be drawn.  See <em>Watson</em>, 487 U. S., at 1004 (Blackmun, J., joined by Brennan and Marshall, JJ., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (noting that in a disparate-treatment claim, the <em>McDonnell Douglas </em>factors establish discrimination by inference).  See also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Zhuang </em>v. <em>Datacard Corp.</em>, 414 F.\xc2\xa03d 849 (CA8 2005) (rejecting inference of discrimination from performance evaluations); <em>Cooper </em>v. <em>Southern Co.</em>, 390 F.\xc2\xa03d 695, 732\xe2\x80\x93733 (CA11 2004) (same).  This can be a subtle determination, and the passage of time may seriously diminish the ability of the parties and the factfinder to reconstruct what actually happened.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter contends that employers would be protected by the equitable doctrine of laches, but Congress plainly did not think that laches was sufficient in this context.  Indeed, Congress took a diametrically different approach, including in Title VII a provision allowing only a few months in most cases to file a charge with the EEOC.  42 U.

By operation of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(1) and 2000e\xe2\x80\x935(f)(1), a Title VII \xe2\x80\x9cclaim is time barred if it is not filed within these time limits.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Morgan</em>, 536 U. S., at 109; <em>Electrical Workers,</em> 429 U. S., at 236.  We therefore reject the suggestion that an employment practice committed with no improper purpose and no discriminatory intent is rendered unlawful nonetheless because it gives some effect to an intentional discriminatory act that occurred outside the charging period.  Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claim is, for this reason, untimely.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In advancing her two theories Ledbetter does not seriously contest the logic of <em>Evans</em>,<em> Ricks</em>, <em>Lorance</em>, and <em>Morgan</em> as set out above, but rather argues that our decision in <em>Bazemore</em> v. <em>Friday</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/385/index.html">478 U. S. 385</a> (1986) <em>(per curiam)</em>, requires different treatment of her claim because it relates to pay.  Ledbetter focuses specifically on our statement that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]ach week\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck that delivers less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395.  She argues that in <em>Bazemore</em> we adopted a \xe2\x80\x9cpaycheck accrual rule\xe2\x80\x9d under which each paycheck, even if not accompanied by discriminatory intent, triggers a new EEOC charging period during which the complainant may properly challenge any prior discriminatory conduct that impacted the amount of that paycheck, no matter how long ago the discrimination occurred.  On this reading, <em>Bazemore</em> dispensed with the need to prove actual discriminatory intent in pay cases and, without giving any hint that it was doing so, repudiated the very different approach taken previously in <em>Evans</em> and <em>Ricks</em>.  Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is unsound.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bazemore</em> concerned a disparate-treatment pay claim brought against the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service (Service).  478 U. S., at 389\xe2\x80\x93390.  Service employees were originally segregated into \xe2\x80\x9ca white branch\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98Negro branch,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d with the latter receiving less pay, but in 1965 the two branches were merged.  <em>Id.</em>, at 390\xe2\x80\x93391.  After Title VII was extended to public employees in 1972, black employees brought suit claiming that pay disparities attributable to the old dual pay scale persisted.  <em>Id.</em>, at 391.  The Court of Appeals rejected this claim, which it interpreted to be that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98discriminatory difference in salaries should have been affirmatively eliminated.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 395.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court reversed in a <em>per curiam</em> opinion, 478 U. S., at 386\xe2\x80\x93388, but all of the Members of the Court joined Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s separate opinion, see <em>id., </em>at 388 (opinion concurring in part).  Justice Brennan wrote:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe error of the Court of Appeals with respect to salary disparities created prior to 1972 and perpetuated thereafter is too obvious to warrant extended discussion: that the Extension Service discriminated with respect to salaries <em>prior</em> to the time it was covered by Title VII does not excuse perpetuating that discrimination <em>after</em> the Extension Service became covered by Title VII.  To hold otherwise would have the effect of exempting from liability those employers who were historically the greatest offenders of the rights of blacks.  A pattern or practice that would have constituted a violation of Title VII, but for the fact that the statute had not yet become effective, became a violation upon Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s effective date, and to the extent an employer continued to engage in that act or practice, it is liable under that statute.  While recovery may not be permitted for pre-1972 acts of discrimination, to the extent that this discrimination was perpetuated after 1972, liability may be imposed.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395 (emphasis in original).</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Far from adopting the approach that Ledbetter advances here, this passage made a point that was \xe2\x80\x9ctoo obvious to warrant extended discussion,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid.;</em> namely, that when an employer adopts a facially discriminatory pay structure that puts some employees on a lower scale because of race, the employer engages in intentional discrimination whenever it issues a check to one of these disfavored employees.  An employer that adopts and intentionally retains such a pay structure can surely be regarded as intending to discriminate on the basis of race as long as the structure is used.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bazemore </em>thus is entirely consistent with our prior precedents,<em> </em>as Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion took care to point out.  Noting that <em>Evans</em> turned on whether \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any <em>present violation</em> exist[ed],\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Justice Brennan stated that the <em>Bazemore </em>plaintiffs were alleging that the defendants \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] not from the date of the Act forward made all their employment decisions in a wholly nondiscriminatory way,\xe2\x80\x9d 478 U. S., at 396\xe2\x80\x93397, n.\xc2\xa06 (emphasis in original; internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)\xe2\x80\x93which is to say that they had engaged in fresh discrimination.  Justice Brennan added that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cholding in no sense g[ave] legal effect to the pre-1972 actions, but, consistent with <em>Evans</em> \xe2\x80\xa6 focuse[d] on the present salary structure, which is illegal if it <em>is a mere continuation of the pre-1965 discriminatory pay structure</em>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id., </em>at 397, n.\xc2\xa06 (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The sentence in Justice Brennan\xe2\x80\x99s opinion on which Ledbetter chiefly relies comes directly after the passage quoted above, and makes a similarly obvious point:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cEach week\xe2\x80\x99s paycheck that delivers less to a black than to a similarly situated white is a wrong actionable under Title VII, regardless of the fact that this pattern was begun prior to the effective date of Title VII.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 395.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\nIn other words, a freestanding violation may always be charged within its own charging period regardless of its connection to other violations.  We repeated this same point more recently in <em>Morgan:</em> \xe2\x80\x9cThe existence of past acts and the employee\xe2\x80\x99s prior knowledge of their occurrence \xe2\x80\xa6 does not bar employees from filing charges about related discrete acts so long as the acts are independently discriminatory and charges addressing those acts are themselves timely filed.\xe2\x80\x9d  536 U. S., at 113.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]  Neither of these opinions stands for the proposition that an action not comprising an employment practice and alleged discriminatory intent is separately chargeable, just because it is related to some past act of discrimination.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter attempts to eliminate the obvious inconsistencies between her interpretation of <em>Bazemore</em> and the <em>Evans/Ricks/Lorance/Morgan</em> line of cases on the ground that none of the latter cases involved pay raises, but the logic of our prior cases is fully applicable to pay cases.  To take <em>Evans</em> as an example, the employee there was unlawfully terminated; this caused her to lose seniority; and the loss of seniority affected her wages, among other things.  431 U. S., at 555, n.\xc2\xa05 (\xe2\x80\x9c[S]eniority determine[s] a flight attendant\xe2\x80\x99s wages; the duration and timing of vacations; rights to retention in the event of layoffs and rights to re-employment thereafter; and rights to preferential selection of flight assignments\xe2\x80\x9d).  The relationship between past discrimination and adverse present effects was the same in <em>Evans</em> as it is here.  Thus, the argument that Ledbetter urges us to accept here would necessarily have commanded a different outcome in <em>Evans</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Bazemore</em> stands for the proposition that an employer violates Title VII and triggers a new EEOC charging period whenever the employer issues paychecks using a discriminatory pay structure.  But a new Title VII violation does not occur and a new charging period is not triggered when an employer issues paychecks pursuant to a system that is \xe2\x80\x9cfacially nondiscriminatory and neutrally applied.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Lorance</em>, 490 U. S., at 911.  The fact that precharging period discrimination adversely affects the calculation of a neutral factor (like seniority) that is used in determining future pay does not mean that each new paycheck constitutes a new violation and restarts the EEOC charging period.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because Ledbetter has not adduced evidence that Goodyear initially adopted its performance-based pay system in order to discriminate on the basis of sex or that it later applied this system to her within the charging period with any discriminatory animus, <em>Bazemore</em> is of no help to her.  Rather, all Ledbetter has alleged is that Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s agents discriminated against her individually in the past and that this discrimination reduced the amount of later paychecks.  Because Ledbetter did not file timely EEOC charges relating to her employer\xe2\x80\x99s discriminatory pay decisions in the past, she cannot maintain a suit based on that past discrimination at this time.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent also argues that pay claims are different.  Its principal argument is that a pay discrimination claim is like a hostile work environment claim because both types of claims are \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98based on the cumulative effect of individual acts,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, but this analogy overlooks the critical conceptual distinction between these two types of claims.  And although the dissent relies heavily on <em>Morgan</em>, the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s argument is fundamentally inconsistent with <em>Morgan</em>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0<em>Morgan</em> distinguished between \xe2\x80\x9cdiscrete\xe2\x80\x9d acts of discrimination and a hostile work environment.  A discrete act of discrimination is an act that in itself \xe2\x80\x9cconstitutes a separate actionable \xe2\x80\x98unlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and that is temporally distinct.  <em>Morgan</em>, 536 U. S., at 114, 117.  As examples we identified \xe2\x80\x9ctermination, failure to promote, denial of transfer, or refusal to hire.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 114.  A hostile work environment, on the other hand, typically comprises a succession of harassing acts, each of which \xe2\x80\x9cmay not be actionable on its own.\xe2\x80\x9d In addition, a hostile work environment claim \xe2\x80\x9ccannot be said to occur on any particular day.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 115\xe2\x80\x93116.  In other words, the actionable wrong is the environment, not the individual acts that, taken together, create the environment.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s assertion, <em>post</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937, what Ledbetter alleged was not a single wrong consisting of a succession of acts.  Instead, she alleged a series of discrete discriminatory acts, see Brief for Petitioner 13, 15 (arguing that payment of each paycheck constituted a separate violation of Title VII), each of which <em>was</em> independently identifiable and actionable, and <em>Morgan</em> is perfectly clear that when an employee alleges \xe2\x80\x9cserial violations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, a series of actionable wrongs, a timely EEOC charge must be filed with respect to each discrete alleged violation. <em> </em>536 U. S., at 113.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While this fundamental misinterpretation of <em>Morgan</em> is alone sufficient to show that the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s approach must be rejected, it should also be noted that the dissent is coy as to whether it would apply the same rule to all pay discrimination claims or whether it would limit the rule to cases like Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s, in which multiple discriminatory pay decisions are alleged.  The dissent relies on the fact that Ledbetter was allegedly subjected to a series of discriminatory pay decisions over a period of time, and the dissent suggests that she did not realize for some time that she had been victimized.  But not all pay cases share these characteristics.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If, as seems likely, the dissent would apply the same rule in all pay cases, then, if a single discriminatory pay decision made 20 years ago continued to affect an employee\xe2\x80\x99s pay today, the dissent would presumably hold that the employee could file a timely EEOC charge today.  And the dissent would presumably allow this even if the employee had full knowledge of all the circumstances relating to the 20-year-old decision at the time it was made.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The dissent, it appears, proposes that we adopt a special rule for pay cases based on the particular characteristics of one case that is certainly not representative of all pay cases and may not even be typical.  We refuse to take that approach.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In addition to the arguments previously discussed, Ledbetter relies largely on analogies to other statutory regimes and on extrastatutory policy arguments to support her \xe2\x80\x9cpaycheck accrual rule.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter places significant weight on the EPA, which was enacted contemporaneously with Title VII and prohibits paying unequal wages for equal work because of sex.  29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7206(d).  Stating that \xe2\x80\x9cthe lower courts routinely hear [EPA] claims challenging pay disparities that first arose outside the limitations period,\xe2\x80\x9d Ledbetter suggests that we should hold that Title VII is violated each time an employee receives a paycheck that reflects past discrimination.  Brief for Petitioner 34\xe2\x80\x9335.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The simple answer to this argument is that the EPA and Title VII are not the same.  In particular, the EPA does not require the filing of a charge with the EEOC or proof of intentional discrimination.  See \xc2\xa7206(d)(1) (asking only whether the alleged inequality resulted from \xe2\x80\x9cany other factor other than sex\xe2\x80\x9d).  Ledbetter originally asserted an EPA claim, but that claim was dismissed by the District Court and is not before us.  If Ledbetter had pursued her EPA claim, she would not face the Title VII obstacles that she now confronts.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s appeal to the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) is equally unavailing.  Stating that it is \xe2\x80\x9cwell established that the statute of limitations for violations of the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the [FLSA] runs anew with each paycheck,\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 35, Ledbetter urges that the same should be true in a Title VII pay case.  Again, however, Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s argument overlooks the fact that an FLSA minimum wage or overtime claim does not require proof of a specific intent to discriminate.  See 29 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7207 (establishing overtime rules); cf. \xc2\xa7255(a) (establishing 2-year statute of limitations for FLSA claims, except for claims of a \xe2\x80\x9cwillful violation,\xe2\x80\x9d which may be commenced within 3 years).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter is on firmer ground in suggesting that we look to cases arising under the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) since the NLRA provided a model for Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial provisions and, like Title VII, requires the filing of a timely administrative charge (with the National Labor Relations Board) before suit may be maintained.  <em>Lorance,</em> 490 U.

Among other things, she claims that pay discrimination is harder to detect than other forms of employment discrimination.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We are not in a position to evaluate Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s policy arguments, and it is not our prerogative to change the way in which Title VII balances the interests of aggrieved employees against the interest in encouraging the \xe2\x80\x9cprompt processing of all charges of employment discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Mohasco</em>, 447 U.

See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(2) (allowing for Title VII liability arising from an intentionally discriminatory seniority system both at the time of its adoption and at the time of its application).  The dissent attaches great significance to this amendment, suggesting that it shows that <em>Lorance</em> was wrongly reasoned as an initial matter.  <em>Post</em>, at 10\xe2\x80\x9312 (opinion of Ginsburg,\xc2\xa0J.).  However, the very legislative history cited by the dissent explains that this amendment and the other 1991 Title VII amendments \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98<em>expand[ed]</em> the scope of relevant civil rights statutes in order to provide adequate protection to victims of discrimination.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 11 (emphasis added).  For present purposes, what is most important about the amendment in question is that it applied only to the adoption of a discriminatory seniority system, not to other types of employment discrimination.  <em>Evans</em> and <em>Ricks</em>, upon which <em>Lorance</em> relied, 490 U. S., at 906\xe2\x80\x93908, and which employed identical reasoning, were left in place, and these decisions are more than sufficient to support our holding today.</p>\n<a href="#T3" name="F3">Footnote 3</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0Of course, there may be instances where the elements forming a cause of action span more than 180 days.  Say, for instance, an employer forms an illegal discriminatory intent towards an employee but does not act on it until 181 days later.  The charging period would not begin to run until the employment practice was executed on day 181 because until that point the employee had no cause of action.  The act and intent had not yet been joined.  Here, by contrast, Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s cause of action was fully formed and present at the time that the discriminatory employment actions were taken against her, at which point she could have, and should have, sued.</p>\n<a href="#T4" name="F4">Footnote 4</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The dissent dismisses this concern, <em>post</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, but this case illustrates the problems created by tardy lawsuits.  Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claims of sex discrimination turned principally on the misconduct of a single Goodyear supervisor, who, Ledbetter testified, retaliated against her when she rejected his sexual advances during the early 1980\xe2\x80\x99s, and did so again in the mid-1990\xe2\x80\x99s when he falsified deficiency reports about her work.  His misconduct, Ledbetter argues, was \xe2\x80\x9ca principal basis for [her] performance evaluation in 1997.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 6; see also <em>id.</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x936, 8, 11 (stressing the same supervisor\xe2\x80\x99s misconduct).  Yet, by the time of trial, this supervisor had died and therefore could not testify.  A timely charge might have permitted his evidence to be weighed contemporaneously.</p>\n<a href="#T5" name="F5">Footnote 5</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0That the focus in <em>Bazemore </em>was on a current violation, not the carrying forward of a past act of discrimination, was made clearly by the side opinion in the Court of Appeals:</p>\n<p>\n\n\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he majority holds, in effect, that because the pattern of discriminatory salaries here challenged originated before applicable provisions of the Civil Rights Act made their payment illegal, any \xe2\x80\x98lingering effects\xe2\x80\x99 of that earlier pattern cannot (presumably on an indefinitely maintained basis) be considered in assessing a challenge to post-act continuation of that pattern.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c<em>Hazelwood</em> and <em>Evans</em> indeed made it clear that an employer cannot be found liable, or sanctioned with remedy, for employment decisions made before they were declared illegal or as to which the claimant has lost any right of action by lapse of time.  For this reason it is generally true that, as the catch-phrase has it, Title VII imposed \xe2\x80\x98no obligation to catch-up,\xe2\x80\x99 i.e., affirmatively to remedy present effects of pre-Act discrimination, whether in composing a work force or otherwise.  But those cases cannot be thought to insulate employment decisions that presently are illegal on the basis that at one time <em>comparable </em>decisions were legal when made by the particular employer.  It is therefore one thing to say that an employer who upon the effective date of Title VII finds itself with a racially unbalanced work-force need not act affirmatively to redress the balance; and quite another to say that it may also continue to make discriminatory hiring decisions because it was by that means that its present work force was composed.  It may not, in short, under the <em>Hazelwood/Evans </em>principle continue practices now violative simply because at one time they were not.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Bazemore </em>v. <em>Friday, </em>751 F.\xc2\xa02d 662, 695\xe2\x80\x93696 (CA4 1984) (Phillips, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (emphasis in original; footnotes omitted).</p>\n<a href="#T6" name="F6">Footnote 6</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The briefs filed with this Court in <em>Bazemore</em> v. <em>Friday, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html"></a><a href="/us/478/385/index.html">478 U.

For most of those years, she worked as an area manager, a position largely occupied by men.  Initially, Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s salary was in line with the salaries of men performing substantially similar work.  Over time, however, her pay slipped in comparison to the pay of male area managers with equal or less seniority.  By the end of 1997, Ledbetter was the only woman working as an area manager and the pay discrepancy between Ledbetter and her 15 male counterparts was stark: Ledbetter was paid $3,727 per month; the lowest paid male area manager received $4,286 per month, the highest paid, $5,236.  See 421 F.\xc2\xa03d 1169, 1174 (CA11 2005); Brief for Petitioner 4.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Ledbetter launched charges of discrimination before the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in March 1998.  Her formal administrative complaint specified that, in violation of Title VII, Goodyear paid her a discriminatorily low salary because of her sex.  See 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x932(a)(1) (rendering it unlawful for an employer \xe2\x80\x9cto discriminate against any individual with respect to [her] compensation \xe2\x80\xa6 because of such individual\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\xa6 sex\xe2\x80\x9d).  That charge was eventually tried to a jury, which found it \xe2\x80\x9cmore likely than not that [Goodyear] paid [Ledbetter] a[n] unequal salary because of her sex.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 102.  In accord with the jury\xe2\x80\x99s liability determination, the District Court entered judgment for Ledbetter for backpay and damages, plus counsel fees and costs.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit reversed. Relying on Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s system of annual merit-based raises, the court held that Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s claim, in relevant part, was time barred.  421 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1171, 1182\xe2\x80\x931183.  Title VII provides that a charge of discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cshall be filed within [180] days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(e)(1).[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Ledbetter charged, and proved at trial, that within the 180-day period, her pay was substantially less than the pay of men doing the same work.  Further, she introduced evidence sufficient to establish that discrimination against female managers at the Gadsden plant, not performance inadequacies on her part, accounted for the pay differential.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, App. 36\xe2\x80\x9347, 51\xe2\x80\x9368, 82\xe2\x80\x9387, 90\xe2\x80\x9398, 112\xe2\x80\x93113.  That evidence was unavailing, the Eleventh Circuit held, and the Court today agrees, because it was incumbent on Ledbetter to file charges year-by-year, each time Goodyear failed to increase her salary commensurate with the salaries of male peers.  Any annual pay decision not contested immediately (within 180 days), the Court affirms, becomes grandfathered, a <em>fait accompli</em> beyond the province of Title VII ever to repair.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence on immediate contest overlooks common characteristics of pay discrimination.  Pay disparities often occur, as they did in Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s case, in small increments; cause to suspect that discrimination is at work develops only over time.  Comparative pay information, moreover, is often hidden from the employee\xe2\x80\x99s view.  Employers may keep under wraps the pay differentials maintained among supervisors, no less the reasons for those differentials.  Small initial discrepancies may not be seen as meet for a federal case, particularly when the employee, trying to succeed in a nontraditional environment, is averse to making waves.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Pay disparities are thus significantly different from adverse actions \xe2\x80\x9csuch as termination, failure to promote, \xe2\x80\xa6 or refusal to hire,\xe2\x80\x9d all involving fully communicated discrete acts, \xe2\x80\x9ceasy to identify\xe2\x80\x9d as discriminatory.  See <em>National Railroad Passenger Corporation</em> v. <em>Morgan</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/536/101/index.html"></a><a href="/us/536/101/index.html">536 U. S. 101</a>, 114 (2002).  It is only when the disparity becomes apparent and sizable, <em>e.g</em>., through future raises calculated as a percentage of current salaries, that an employee in Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s situation is likely to comprehend her plight and, therefore, to complain.  Her initial readiness to give her employer the benefit of the doubt should not preclude her from later challenging the then current and continuing payment of a wage depressed on account of her sex.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0On questions of time under Title VII, we have identified as the critical inquiries: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat constitutes an \xe2\x80\x98unlawful employment practice\xe2\x80\x99 and when has that practice \xe2\x80\x98occurred\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 110.  Our precedent suggests, and lower courts have overwhelmingly held, that the unlawful practice is the <em>current payment</em> of salaries infected by gender-based (or race-based) discrimination\xe2\x80\x94a practice that occurs whenever a paycheck delivers less to a woman than to a similarly situated man.  See <em>Bazemore</em> v. <em>Friday</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/478/385/index.html">478 U.

One answer identifies the pay-setting decision, and that decision alone, as the unlawful practice.  Under this view, each particular salary-setting decision is discrete from prior and subsequent decisions, and must be challenged within 180 days on pain of forfeiture.  Another response counts both the pay-setting decision and the actual payment of a discriminatory wage as unlawful practices.  Under this approach, each payment of a wage or salary infected by sex-based discrimination constitutes an unlawful employment practice; prior decisions, outside the 180-day charge-filing period, are not themselves actionable, but they are relevant in determining the lawfulness of conduct within the period.  The Court adopts the first view, see <em>ante</em>, at 1, 4, 9, but the second is more faithful to precedent, more in tune with the realities of the workplace, and more respectful of Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s remedial purpose.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Bazemore</em>, we unanimously held that an employer, the North Carolina Agricultural Extension Service, committed an unlawful employment practice each time it paid black employees less than similarly situated white employees.  478 U. S., at 395 (opinion of Brennan, J.).  Before 1965, the Extension Service was divided into two branches: a white branch and a \xe2\x80\x9cNegro branch.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 390.  Employees in the \xe2\x80\x9cNegro branch\xe2\x80\x9d were paid less than their white counterparts.  In response to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which included Title VII, the State merged the two branches into a single organization, made adjustments to reduce the salary disparity, and began giving annual raises based on nondiscriminatory factors.  <em>Id</em>., at 390\xe2\x80\x93391, 394\xe2\x80\x93395.  Nonetheless, \xe2\x80\x9csome pre-existing salary disparities continued to linger on.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id</em>., at 394 (internal quotation marks omitted).<font b="1">  We rejected the Court of Appeals\xe2\x80\x99 conclusion that the plaintiffs could not prevail because the lingering disparities were simply a continuing effect of a decision lawfully made prior to the effective date of Title VII.  See <em>id</em>., at 395\xe2\x80\x93396.

See<em> supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  Over time, she alleged and proved, the repetition of pay decisions undervaluing her work gave rise to the current discrimination of which she complained.  Though component acts fell outside the charge-filing period, with each new paycheck, Goodyear contributed incrementally to the accumulating harm.  See<em> Morgan</em>, 536 U. S., at 117;<em> Bazemore</em>, 478 U.

And promotions, transfers, hirings, and firings are generally public events, known to co-workers.  When an employer makes a decision of such open and definitive character, an employee can immediately seek out an explanation and evaluate it for pretext.  Compensation disparities, in contrast, are often hidden from sight.  It is not unusual, decisions in point illustrate, for management to decline to publish employee pay levels, or for employees to keep private their own salaries.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Goodwin </em>v. <em>General Motors Corp</em>., 275 F.\xc2\xa03d 1005, 1008\xe2\x80\x931009 (CA10 2002) (plaintiff did not know what her colleagues earned until a printout listing of salaries appeared on her desk, seven years after her starting salary was set lower than her co-workers\xe2\x80\x99 salaries); <em>McMillan </em>v. <em>Massachusetts Soc. for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals</em>, 140 F.\xc2\xa03d 288, 296 (CA1 1998) (plaintiff worked for employer for years before learning of salary disparity published in a newspaper).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  Tellingly, as the record in this case bears out, Goodyear kept salaries confidential; employees had only limited access to information regarding their colleagues\xe2\x80\x99 earnings.  App. 56\xe2\x80\x9357, 89.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The problem of concealed pay discrimination is particularly acute where the disparity arises not because the female employee is flatly denied a raise but because male counterparts are given larger raises.  Having received a pay increase, the female employee is unlikely to discern at once that she has experienced an adverse employment decision.  She may have little reason even to suspect discrimination until a pattern develops incrementally and she ultimately becomes aware of the disparity.  Even if an employee suspects that the reason for a comparatively low raise is not performance but sex (or another protected ground), the amount involved may seem too small, or the employer\xe2\x80\x99s intent too ambiguous, to make the issue immediately actionable\xe2\x80\x94or winnable.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Further separating pay claims from the discrete employment actions identified in <em>Morgan</em>, an<em> </em>employer gains from sex-based pay disparities in a way it does not from a discriminatory denial of promotion, hiring, or transfer.  When a male employee is selected over a female for a higher level position, someone still gets the promotion and is paid a higher salary; the employer is not enriched.  But when a woman is paid less than a similarly situated man, the employer reduces its costs each time the pay differential is implemented.  Furthermore, decisions on promotions, like decisions installing seniority systems, often implicate the interests of third-party employees in a way that pay differentials do not.  Cf. <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/324/index.html">431 U. S. 324</a>, 352\xe2\x80\x93353 (1977) (recognizing that seniority systems involve \xe2\x80\x9cvested \xe2\x80\xa6 rights of employees\xe2\x80\x9d and concluding that Title VII was not intended to \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy or water down\xe2\x80\x9d those rights).  Disparate pay, by contrast, can be remedied at any time solely at the expense of the employer who acts in a discriminatory fashion.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In light of the significant differences between pay disparities and discrete employment decisions of the type identified in <em>Morgan</em>, the cases on which the Court relies hold no sway.  See <em>ante</em>, at 5\xe2\x80\x9310 (discussing <em>United Air Lines, Inc.</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/431/553/index.html">431 U.

S. 900</a> (1989)).  <em>Evans </em>and <em>Ricks </em>both involved a single, immediately identifiable act of discrimination: in <em>Evans</em>, a constructive discharge, 431 U. S., at 554; in <em>Ricks</em>, a denial of tenure, 449 U. S., at 252.  In each case, the employee filed charges well after the discrete discriminatory act occurred: When United Airlines forced Evans to resign because of its policy barring married female flight attendants, she filed no charge; only four years later, when Evans was rehired, did she allege that the airline\xe2\x80\x99s former no-marriage rule was unlawful and therefore should not operate to deny her seniority credit for her prior service.  See <em>Evans</em>,<em> </em>431 U. S., at 554\xe2\x80\x93557.  Similarly, when Delaware State College denied Ricks tenure, he did not object until his terminal contract came to an end, one year later.  <em>Ricks</em>, 449 U. S., at 253\xe2\x80\x93254, 257\xe2\x80\x93258.  No repetitive, cumulative discriminatory employment practice was at issue in either case.  See <em>Evans</em>, 431 U.

But Congress made clear (1) its view that this Court had unduly <em>contracted</em> the scope of protection afforded by Title VII and other civil rights statutes, and (2) its aim to generalize the ruling in <em>Bazemore</em>. <em> </em>As the Senate Report accompanying the proposed Civil Rights Act of 1990, the precursor to the 1991 Act, explained:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWhere, as was alleged in <em>Lorance</em>, an employer adopts a rule or decision with an unlawful discriminatory motive, each application of that rule or decision is a new violation of the law. <em> </em>In <em>Bazemore</em> . . ., for example, \xe2\x80\xa6 the Supreme Court properly held that each application of th[e] racially motivated salary structure, <em>i.e.</em>, each new paycheck, constituted a distinct violation of Title VII.

It is mistaken to do so now.  Just as Congress\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cgoals in enacting Title VII \xe2\x80\xa6 never included conferring absolute immunity on discriminatorily adopted seniority systems that survive their first [180] days,\xe2\x80\x9d 490 U. S., at 914 (Marshall, J., dissenting), Congress never intended to immunize forever discriminatory pay differentials unchallenged within 180 days of their adoption.  This assessment gains weight when one comprehends that even a relatively minor pay disparity will expand exponentially over an employee\xe2\x80\x99s working life if raises are set as a percentage of prior pay.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0A clue to congressional intent can be found in Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s backpay provision.  The statute expressly provides that backpay may be awarded for a period of up to two years before the discrimination charge is filed.  42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000e\xe2\x80\x935(g)(1) (\xe2\x80\x9cBack pay liability shall not accrue from a date more than two years prior to the filing of a charge with the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d).  This prescription indicates that Congress contemplated challenges to pay discrimination commencing before, but continuing into, the 180-day filing period.  See <em>Morgan</em>, 536 U. S., at 119 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf Congress intended to limit liability to conduct occurring in the period within which the party must file the charge, it seems unlikely that Congress would have allowed recovery for two years of backpay.\xe2\x80\x9d).  As we recognized in <em>Morgan</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cthe fact that Congress expressly limited the amount of recoverable damages elsewhere to a particular time period [<em>i.e.</em>, two years]<em> </em>indicates that the [180-day] timely filing provision was not meant to serve as a specific limitation \xe2\x80\xa6 [on] the conduct that may be considered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid</em>.</p>\n<p align="left">D</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In tune with the realities of wage discrimination, the Courts of Appeals have overwhelmingly judged as a present violation the payment of wages infected by discrimination: Each paycheck less than the amount payable had the employer adhered to a nondiscriminatory compensation regime, courts have held, constitutes a cognizable harm.

Notably, the EPA provides no relief when the pay discrimination charged is based on race, religion, national origin, age, or disability.<font b="1">  Thus, in truncating the Title VII rule this Court announced in <em>Bazemore</em>, the Court does not disarm female workers from achieving redress for unequal pay, but it does impede racial and other minorities from gaining similar relief.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Furthermore, the difference between the EPA\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition against paying unequal wages and Title VII\xe2\x80\x99s ban on discrimination with regard to compensation is not as large as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion might suggest.  See <em>ante</em>, at 21.  The key distinction is that Title VII requires a showing of intent.  In practical effect, \xe2\x80\x9cif the trier of fact is in equipoise about whether the wage differential is motivated by gender discrimination,\xe2\x80\x9d Title VII compels a verdict for the employer, while the EPA compels a verdict for the plaintiff.  2 C. Sullivan, M. Zimmer, &amp; R. White, Employment Discrimination: Law and Practice \xc2\xa77.08[F][3], p. 532 (3d ed. 2002).  In this case, Ledbetter carried the burden of persuading the jury that the pay disparity she suffered was attributable to intentional sex discrimination.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932; <em>infra</em>, this page and 18.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0To show how far the Court has strayed from interpretation of Title VII with fidelity to the Act\xe2\x80\x99s core purpose, I return to the evidence Ledbetter presented at trial.  Ledbetter proved to the jury the following: She was a member of a protected class; she performed work substantially equal to work of the dominant class (men); she was compensated less for that work; and the disparity was attributable to gender-based discrimination.  See <em>supra</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Specifically, Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s evidence demonstrated that her current pay was discriminatorily low due to a long series of decisions reflecting Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s pervasive discrimination against women managers in general and Ledbetter in particular.  Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s former supervisor, for example, admitted to the jury that Ledbetter\xe2\x80\x99s pay, during a particular one-year period, fell below Goodyear\xe2\x80\x99s minimum threshold for her position.  App. 93\xe2\x80\x9397.<font b="1">  Although Goodyear claimed the pay disparity was due to poor performance, the supervisor acknowledged that Ledbetter received a \xe2\x80\x9cTop Performance Award\xe2\x80\x9d in 1996.  <em>Id.,</em> at 90\xe2\x80\x9393.  The jury also heard testimony that another supervisor\xe2\x80\x94who evaluated Ledbetter in 1997 and whose evaluation led to her most recent raise denial\xe2\x80\x94was openly biased against women.  <em>Id.,</em> at 46, 77\xe2\x80\x9382.  And two women who had previously worked as managers at the plant told the jury they had been subject to pervasive discrimination and were paid less than their male counterparts.  One was paid less than the men she supervised.  <em>Id.,</em> at 51\xe2\x80\x9368.  Ledbetter herself testified about the discriminatory animus conveyed to her by plant officials.  Toward the end of her career, for instance, the plant manager told Ledbetter that the \xe2\x80\x9cplant did not need women, that [women] didn\xe2\x80\x99t help it, [and] caused problems.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 36.[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]  After weighing all the evidence, the jury found for Ledbetter, concluding that the pay disparity was due to intentional discrimination.</font></p><font b="1">\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Yet, under the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision, the discrimination Ledbetter proved is not redressable under Title VII.  Each and every pay decision she did not immediately challenge wiped the slate clean.  Consideration may not be given to the cumulative effect of a series of decisions that, together, set her pay well below that of every male area manager.  Knowingly carrying past pay discrimination forward must be treated as lawful conduct.  Ledbetter may not be compensated for the lower pay she was in fact receiving when she complained to the EEOC.  Nor, were she still employed by Goodyear, could she gain, on the proof she presented at trial, injunctive relief requiring, prospectively, her receipt of the same compensation men receive for substantially similar work.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s approbation of these consequences is totally at odds with the robust protection against workplace discrimination Congress intended Title VII to secure.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Teamsters</em> v. <em>United States</em>, 431 U. S., at 348 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe primary purpose of Title VII was to assure equality of employment opportunities and to eliminate \xe2\x80\xa6 discriminatory practices and devices\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted)); <em>Albemarle Paper Co.</em> v. <em>Moody</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/422/405/index.html">422 U.
