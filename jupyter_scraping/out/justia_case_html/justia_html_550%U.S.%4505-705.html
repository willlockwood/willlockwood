Indeed, Congress largely copied language from the earlier Interstate Commerce Act, which authorized federal railroad regulation, when it wrote Communications Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207, the provisions at issue.  Both Acts authorize their respective commissions to declare any carrier \xe2\x80\x9ccharge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregulation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s services to be \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d; declare an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d; authorize an injured person to recover \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d for an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d charge or practice; and state that, to do so, the person may bring suit in a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Interstate Commerce Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 8, 9; Communications Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b), 206, 207.  The underlying regulatory problem here arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more competitively oriented approaches.  Legislation in 1990 required payphone operators to allow payphone users to obtain \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d access to the long-distance carrier of their choice, <em>i.e., </em>access without depositing coins.  But recognizing the \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d call would impose a cost upon the payphone operator, Congress required the FCC to promulgate regulations to provide compensation to such operators.  Using traditional ratemaking methods, the FCC ordered carriers to reimburse the operators in a specified amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed to a different amount.  The FCC subsequently determined that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay such compensation was an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d and thus unlawful under \xc2\xa7201(b).  Respondent payphone operator brought a federal lawsuit, claiming that petitioner long-distance carrier (hereinafter Global Crossing) had violated \xc2\xa7201(b) by failing to pay compensation and that \xc2\xa7207 authorized respondent to sue in federal court.  The District Court agreed that Global Crossing\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay violated \xc2\xa7201(b), thereby permitting respondent to sue under \xc2\xa7207.  The Ninth Circuit affirmed.</p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s application of \xc2\xa7201(b) to the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay compensation is lawful; and, given the linkage with \xc2\xa7207, \xc2\xa7207 authorizes this federal-court lawsuit.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The language of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b), 206, and 207 and those sections\xe2\x80\x99 history, including that of their predecessors, Interstate Commerce Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78 and 9, make clear that \xc2\xa7207\xe2\x80\x99s purpose is to allow persons injured by \xc2\xa7201(b) violations to bring federal-court damages actions.  The difficult question is whether the FCC regulation at issue lawfully implements \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition.  Pp.\xc2\xa07\xe2\x80\x939.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0The FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201(b) \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d determination is reasonable, and thus lawful.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843\xe2\x80\x93844.  It easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase.  Moreover, the underlying regulated activity at issue resembles activity long regulated by both transportation and communications agencies.  Traditionally, the FCC, exercising its rate-setting authority, has divided revenues from a call among providers of segments of the call.  Transportation agencies have similarly divided revenues from a larger transportation service among providers of segments of the service.  The payphone operator and long-distance carrier resemble those joint providers of a communication or transportation service.  Differences between the present \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d classification and more traditional regulatory subject matter do not require a different outcome.  When Congress revised the telecommunications laws in 1996 to enhance the role of competition, creating a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon the role of tariffs in regulatory supervision, it left \xc2\xa7201(b) in place.  In light of the absence of any congressional prohibition, and the similarities with traditional regulatory action, the Court finds nothing unreasonable about the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201(b) determination.  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U.

The Commission has added that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay the compensation is a \xe2\x80\x9cpractice \xe2\x80\xa6 that is unjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d within the terms of the Communications Act of 1934, \xc2\xa7201(b), 48 Stat. 1070, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b).  Communications Act language links \xc2\xa7201(b) to \xc2\xa7207, which authorizes any person \xe2\x80\x9cdamaged\xe2\x80\x9d by a violation of \xc2\xa7201(b) to bring a lawsuit to recover damages in federal court.  And we must here decide whether this linked section, \xc2\xa7207, authorizes a payphone operator to bring a federal-court lawsuit against a recalcitrant carrier that refuses to pay the compensation that the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s order says it owes. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s application of \xc2\xa7201(b) to the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay compensation is a reasonable interpretation of the statute; hence it is lawful.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em> v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a>, 843\xe2\x80\x93844, and n. 11 (1984).  And, given the linkage with \xc2\xa7207, we also conclude that \xc2\xa7207 authorizes this federal-court lawsuit.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Because regulatory history helps to illuminate the proper interpretation and application of \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207, we begin with that history.  When Congress enacted the Communications Act of 1934, it granted the FCC broad authority to regulate interstate telephone communications.  See <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em> v. <em>FCC</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/476/355/index.html">476 U. S. 355</a>, 360 (1986).  The Commission, during the first several decades of its history, used this authority to develop a traditional regulatory system much like the systems other commissions had applied when regulating railroads, public utilities, and other common carriers.  A utility or carrier would file with a commission a tariff containing rates, and perhaps other practices, classifications, or regulations in connection with its provision of communications services.  The commission would examine the rates, etc., and, after appropriate proceedings, approve them, set them aside, or, sometimes, set forth a substitute rate schedule or list of approved charges, classifications, or practices that the carrier or utility must follow.  In doing so, the commission might determine the utility\xe2\x80\x99s or carrier\xe2\x80\x99s overall costs (including a reasonable profit), allocate costs to particular services, examine whether, and how, individual rates would generate revenue that would help cover those costs, and, if necessary, provide for a division of revenues among several carriers that together provided a single service.

See <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</em> v. <em>Central Office Telephone, Inc.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/524/214/index.html">524 U. S. 214</a>, 222 (1998).  Indeed, Congress largely copied \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 8, and 9 of the Interstate Commerce Act when it wrote the language of Communications Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207, the sections at issue here.  The relevant sections (in both statutes) authorize the commission to declare any carrier \xe2\x80\x9ccharge,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cregulation,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d in connection with the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s services to be \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d; they declare an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9ccharge\xe2\x80\x9d to be \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d; they authorize an injured person to recover \xe2\x80\x9cdamages\xe2\x80\x9d for an \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d charge or practice; and they state that, to do so, the person may bring suit in a \xe2\x80\x9ccourt\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cof the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Interstate Commerce Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa71, 8, 9, 24 Stat. 379, 382; Communications Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b), 206, 207, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b), 206, 207.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Historically speaking, the Interstate Commerce Act sections changed early, preregulatory common-law rate-supervision procedures.  The common law originally permitted a freight shipper to ask a <em>court</em> to determine whether a railroad rate was unreasonably high and to award the shipper damages in the form of \xe2\x80\x9creparations.\xe2\x80\x9d  The \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d regulatory law, however, made clear that a commission, not a court, would determine a rate\xe2\x80\x99s reasonableness.  At the same time, that \xe2\x80\x9cnew\xe2\x80\x9d law permitted a shipper injured by an unreasonable rate to bring a federal lawsuit to collect damages.

The similar language of Communications Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207 indicates a roughly similar sharing of agency authority with federal courts.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Beginning in the 1970\xe2\x80\x99s, the FCC came to believe that communications markets might efficiently support more than one firm and that competition might supplement (or provide a substitute for) traditional regulation.  See <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp.</em> v. <em>American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/512/218/index.html">512 U. S. 218</a>, 220\xe2\x80\x93221 (1994).  The Commission facilitated entry of new telecommunications carriers into long-distance markets.  And in the 1990\xe2\x80\x99s, Congress amended the 1934 Act while also enacting new telecommunications statutes, in order to encourage (and sometimes to mandate) new competition.  See Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 56, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7609 <em>et seq.</em>  Neither Congress nor the Commission, however, totally abandoned traditional regulatory requirements.  And the new statutes and amendments left many traditional requirements and related statutory provisions, including \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207, in place.  <em>E.g.</em>, <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em> v. <em>Brand X Internet Services</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/545/967/index.html">545 U. S. 967</a>, 975 (2005).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The regulatory problem that underlies this lawsuit arises at the intersection of traditional regulation and newer, more competitively oriented approaches.  Competing long-distance carriers seek the business of individual local callers, including those who wish to make a long-distance call from a local payphone.  A payphone operator, however, controls what is sometimes a necessary channel for the caller to reach the long-distance carrier.  And prior to 1990, a payphone operator, exploiting this control, might require a caller to use a long-distance carrier that the operator favored while blocking access to the caller\xe2\x80\x99s preferred carrier.  Such a practice substituted the operator\xe2\x80\x99s choice of carrier for the caller\xe2\x80\x99s, and it potentially placed disfavored carriers at a competitive disadvantage.  In 1990, Congress enacted special legislation requiring payphone operators to allow a payphone user to obtain \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d access to the carrier of his or her choice, <em>i.e.</em>, access from the payphone without depositing coins.  Telephone Operator Consumer Services Improvement Act of 1990, 104 Stat. 986, codified at 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7226.  (For ease of exposition, we often use familiar terms such as \xe2\x80\x9clong distance\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d calls instead of more precise terms such as \xe2\x80\x9cinterexchange\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9ccoinless\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cdial-around\xe2\x80\x9d calls.)</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, Congress recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d call would impose a cost upon the payphone operator; and it consequently required the FCC to \xe2\x80\x9cprescribe regulations that \xe2\x80\xa6 establish a per call compensation plan to ensure that all payphone service providers are fairly compensated for each and every completed intrastate and interstate call.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa7276(b)(1)(A) of the Communications Act of 1934, as added by \xc2\xa7151 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, 110 Stat. 106, codified at 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7276(b)(1)(A). </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The FCC then considered the compensation problem.  Using traditional ratemaking methods, it found that the (fixed and incremental) costs of a \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d call from a payphone to, say, a long-distance carrier warranted reimbursement of (at the time relevant to this litigation) $0.24 per call.  The FCC ordered carriers to reimburse the payphone operators in this amount unless a carrier and an operator agreed upon a different amount.  47 CFR \xc2\xa764.1300(d) (2005).  At the same time, it left the carriers free to pass the cost along to their customers, the payphone callers.  Thus, in a typical \xe2\x80\x9cfree\xe2\x80\x9d call, the carrier will bill the caller and then must share the revenue the carrier receives\xe2\x80\x94to the tune of $0.24 per call\xe2\x80\x94with the payphone operator that has, together with the carrier, furnished a communications service to the caller.  The FCC subsequently determined that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay the compensation ordered amounts to an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d within the terms of \xc2\xa7201(b).  (We shall refer to these regulations as the Compensation Order and the 2003 Payphone Order, respectively.  See Appendix A, <em>infra,</em> for full citations.)  See generally P. Huber, M. Kellogg, &amp; J. Thorne, Federal Telecommunications Law \xc2\xa78.6.3, pp. 710\xe2\x80\x93713 (2d ed. 1999) (hereinafter Huber).  That determination, it believed, would permit a payphone operator to bring a federal-court lawsuit under \xc2\xa7207, to collect the compensation owed.  2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd. 19975, 19990, \xc2\xb632.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In 2003, respondent, Metrophones Telecommunications, Inc., a payphone operator, brought this federal-court lawsuit against Global Crossing Telecommunications, Inc., a long-distance carrier.  Metrophones sought compensation that it said Global Crossing owed it under the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s Compensation Order, 14 FCC Rcd. 2545 (1999).  Insofar as is relevant here, Metrophones claimed that Global Crossing\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay amounted to a violation of \xc2\xa7201(b), thereby permitting Metrophones to sue in federal court, under \xc2\xa7207, for the compensation owed.  The District Court agreed.  423 F.\xc2\xa03d 1056, 1061 (CA9 2005).  The Ninth Circuit affirmed the District Court\xe2\x80\x99s determination.  <em>Ibid.</em>  We granted certiorari to determine whether \xc2\xa7207 authorizes the lawsuit.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Section 207 says that \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ny person claiming to be damaged by any common carrier \xe2\x80\xa6 may bring suit\xe2\x80\x9d against the carrier \xe2\x80\x9cin any district court of the United States\xe2\x80\x9d for \xe2\x80\x9crecovery of the <em>damages </em>for which such common carrier<em> may be liable </em>under the provisions of this chapter.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7207 (emphasis added).  This language makes clear that the lawsuit is proper <em>if </em>the FCC could properly hold that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay compensation is an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d deemed \xe2\x80\x9cunlawful\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201(b).

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Arizona Grocery Co.</em>, 284 U. S., at 384\xe2\x80\x93385 (Interstate Commerce Act \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa78\xe2\x80\x939); Part I\xe2\x80\x93A, <em>supra</em>.  History also makes clear that the FCC has long implemented \xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa7201(b) through the issuance of rules and regulations.  This is obviously so when the rules take the form of FCC approval or prescription for the future of rates that exclusively are \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  See 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7205 (authorizing the FCC to prescribe reasonable rates and practices in order to preclude rates or practices that violate \xc2\xa7201(b)); 5 U.

It is also so when the FCC has set forth rules that, for example, require certain accounting methods or insist upon certain carrier practices, while (as here) prohibiting others as unjust or unreasonable under \xc2\xa7201(b).  See, <em>e.g. </em>(to name a few), <em>Verizon Tel. Cos. </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, 453 F.\xc2\xa03d 487, 494 (CADC 2006) (rates unreasonable (and hence unlawful) if not adjusted pursuant to accounting rules ordered in FCC regulations);<em> Cable &amp; Wireless  P.

See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp.</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1414 (\xe2\x80\x9cWe have repeatedly held that a rate-of-return prescription has the force of law and that the Commission may therefore treat a violation of the prescription as a <em>per se</em> violation of the requirement of the Communications Act that a common carrier maintain \xe2\x80\x98just and reasonable\xe2\x80\x99 rates, <em>see</em> 47  U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x9d); cf. <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/275/index.html">532 U.

That is why private litigants have long assumed that they may, as the statute says, bring an action under \xc2\xa7207 for violation of a rule or regulation that lawfully implements \xc2\xa7201(b).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Oh </em>v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 76 F.\xc2\xa0Supp. 2d 551, 556 (NJ 1999) (assuming validity of \xc2\xa7207 suit alleging violation of \xc2\xa7201(b) in carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to provide services listed in FCC-approved tariff); <em>Southwestern Bell Tel.

It plainly does.  It remains for us to decide whether the particular FCC regulation before us lawfully implements \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cun-\nreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d prohibition.  We now turn to that\nquestion.</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In our view the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201(b) \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d determination is a reasonable one; hence it is lawful.  See <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.</em>, 467 U. S., at 843\xe2\x80\x93844<em>.</em>  The determination easily fits within the language of the statutory phrase.  That is to say, in ordinary English, one can call a refusal to pay Commission-ordered compensation despite having received a benefit from the payphone operator a \xe2\x80\x9cpractic[e] \xe2\x80\xa6 in connection with [furnishing a] communication service \xe2\x80\xa6 that is \xe2\x80\xa6 unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  The service that the payphone operator provides constitutes an integral part of the total long-distance service the payphone operator and the long-distance carrier together provide to the caller, with respect to the carriage of his or her particular call.  The carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to divide the revenues it receives from the caller with its collaborator, the payphone operator, despite the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s regulation requiring it to do so, can reasonably be called a \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with\xe2\x80\x9d the provision of that service that is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Cf. <em>post</em>, at 1\xe2\x80\x935 (Thomas, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Moreover, the underlying regulated activity at issue here <em>resembles</em> activity that both transportation and communications agencies have long regulated.  Here the agency has determined through traditional regulatory methods the cost of carrying a portion (the payphone portion) of a call that begins with a caller and proceeds through the payphone, attached wires, local communications loops, and long-distance lines to a distant call recipient.  The agency allocates costs among the joint providers of the communications service and requires downstream carriers, in effect, to pay an appropriate share of revenues to upstream payphone operators.  Traditionally, the FCC has determined costs of some segments of a call while requiring providers of other segments to divide related revenues.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Smith</em> v. <em>Illinois Bell Telephone Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/282/133/index.html">282 U. S. 133</a>, 148\xe2\x80\x93151 (1930) (communications).  And traditionally, transportation agencies have determined costs of providing some segments of a larger transportation service (for example, the cost of providing the San Francisco\xe2\x80\x93Ogden segment of a San Francisco\xe2\x80\x93New York shipment) while requiring providers of other segments to divide revenues.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>New England Divisions Case</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/261/184/index.html">261 U. S. 184</a> (1923); <em>Chicago &amp; North Western R. Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/387/326/index.html"></a><a href="/us/387/326/index.html">387 U. S. 326</a>; cf. <em>Cable &amp; Wireless P. L. C.</em>,<em> supra</em>, at 1231.  In all instances an agency allocates costs and provides for a related sharing of revenues.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In these more traditional instances, transportation carriers and communications firms entitled to revenues under rate divisions or cost allocations might bring lawsuits under \xc2\xa7207, or the equivalent sections of the Interstate Commerce Act, and obtain compensation or damages.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Allnet Communication Serv., Inc.</em> v. <em>National Exch. Carrier Assn.</em>, <em>Inc.,</em> 965 F.\xc2\xa02d 1118, 1122 (CADC 1992) (\xc2\xa7207); <em>Southwestern Bell Tel. Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 305 (same); <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1224\xe2\x80\x931225 (Interstate Commerce Act equivalent of \xc2\xa7207).  Again, the similarities support the reasonableness of an agency\xe2\x80\x99s bringing about a similar result here.  We do not suggest that the FCC is required to find carriers\xe2\x80\x99 failures to divide revenues to be \xc2\xa7201(b) violations in every instance.  Cf. <em>U. S. Telepacific Corp. </em>v. <em>Tel-America of Salt Lake City, Inc.</em>, 19 FCC Rcd. 24552, 24555\xe2\x80\x9324556, and n. 27 (2004) (citing cases).  Nor do we suggest that every violation of FCC regulations is an unjust and unreasonable practice.  Here there is an explicit statutory scheme, and compensation of payphone operators is necessary to the proper implementation of that scheme.  Under these circumstances, the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s finding that the failure to follow the order is an unreasonable practice is well within its authority.  </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There are, of course, differences between the present \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d classification and the similar more traditional regulatory subject matter we have just described.  For one thing, the connection between payphone operators and long-distance carriers is not a traditional \xe2\x80\x9cthrough route\xe2\x80\x9d between carriers.  See \xc2\xa7201(a).  For another, as Global Crossing\xe2\x80\x99s <em>amici</em> point out, the word \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7201(b) has traditionally applied to a carrier practice that (unlike the present one) is the subject of a carrier tariff\xe2\x80\x94<em>i.e.</em>, a carrier agency filing that sets forth the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s rates, classifications, and practices.  Brief for AT&amp;T et\xc2\xa0al. as <em>Amici Curiae</em> 8\xe2\x80\x9311.  We concede the differences.  Indeed, traditionally, the filing of tariffs was \xe2\x80\x9cthe centerpiece\xe2\x80\x9d of the \xe2\x80\x9c[Communications] Act\xe2\x80\x99s regulatory scheme.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp.,</em> 512 U. S., at 220.  But we do not concede that these differences require a different outcome.  Statutory changes enhancing the role of competition have radically reduced the role that tariffs play in regulatory supervision of what is now a mixed communications system\xe2\x80\x94a system that relies in part upon competition and in part upon more traditional regulation.  Yet when Congress rewrote the law to bring about these changes, it nonetheless left \xc2\xa7201(b) in place.  That fact indicates that the statute permits, indeed it suggests that Congress likely expected, the FCC to pour new substantive wine into its old regulatory bottles.  See Policy and Rules Concerning the Interstate, Interexchange Marketplace, 12 FCC Rcd. 15014, 15057, \xc2\xb677 (1997) (despite the absence of tariffs, FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201 enforcement obligations have not diminished); <em>Boomer</em> v. <em>AT&amp;T Corp.</em>, 309 F.\xc2\xa03d 404, 422 (CA7 2002) (same).  And this circumstance, by indicating that Congress did not <em>forbid </em>the agency to apply \xc2\xa7201(b) differently in the changed regulatory environment, is sufficient to convince us that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s determination is lawful. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is because we have made clear that where \xe2\x80\x9cCongress would expect the agency to be able to speak with the force of law when it addresses ambiguity in the statute or fills a space in the enacted law,\xe2\x80\x9d a court \xe2\x80\x9cis obliged to accept the agency\xe2\x80\x99s position if Congress has not previously spoken to the point at issue and the agency\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation\xe2\x80\x9d (or the manner in which it fills the \xe2\x80\x9cgap\xe2\x80\x9d) is \xe2\x80\x9creasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Mead Corp.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/533/218/index.html">533 U. S. 218</a>, 229 (2001); <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn.</em>, 545 U. S., at 980; <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc.,</em> 467 U. S., at 843\xe2\x80\x93844<em>.</em>  Congress, in \xc2\xa7201(b), delegated to the agency authority to \xe2\x80\x9cfill\xe2\x80\x9d a \xe2\x80\x9cgap,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>i.e.</em>, to apply \xc2\xa7201 through regulations and orders with the force of law.  <em>National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Assn., supra, </em>at 980\xe2\x80\x93981.  The circumstances mentioned above make clear the absence of any rele-\nvant congressional prohibition.  And, in light of the traditional regulatory similarities that we have discussed, we can find nothing unreasonable about the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201(b) determination.</p>\n<p align="left">C</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Global Crossing, its supporting <em>amici</em>, and the dissents make several additional but ultimately unpersuasive arguments.  First, Global Crossing claims that \xc2\xa7207 authorizes only actions \xe2\x80\x9cseeking damages for <em>statutory </em>violations\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>and not for \xe2\x80\x9cviolations merely of <em>regulations </em>promulgated to carry out statutory objectives.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Petitioner 12 (emphasis in original).  The lawsuit before us, however, \xe2\x80\x9cseek[s] damages for [a] <em>statutory </em>violatio[n],\xe2\x80\x9d namely, a violation of \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition of an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  As we have pointed out, <em>supra</em>,<em> </em>at 8, \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x99s prohibitions have long been thought to extend to rates that diverge from FCC prescriptions, as well as rates or practices that are \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d in light of their failure to reflect rules embodied in an agency regulation.  We have found no limitation of the kind Global Crossing suggests.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Global Crossing seeks to draw support from <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html"></a><a href="/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a> (2001), and <em>Adams Fruit Co.</em> v. <em>Barrett</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/494/638/index.html">494 U. S. 638</a> (1990), which, Global Crossing says, hold that an agency cannot determine through regulation when a private party may bring a federal court action.  Those cases do involve private actions, but they do not support Global Crossing.  The cases involve different statutes and different regulations, and the Court made clear in each of those cases that its holding relied on the specific statute before it.  In <em>Sandoval</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 288\xe2\x80\x93289, the Court found that an implied right of action to enforce one statutory provision, 42 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72000d, did not extend to regulations implementing another, \xc2\xa72000d\xe2\x80\x931.  In contrast, here we are addressing the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation of ambiguous language in a substantive statutory provision, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b), which Congress expressly linked to the right of action provided in \xc2\xa7207.  Nothing in <em>Sandoval </em>requires us to limit our deference to the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s reasonable interpretation of \xc2\xa7201(b); to the contrary, as we noted in <em>Sandoval</em>, it is \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute.  A Congress that intends the statute to be enforced through a private cause of action intends the authoritative interpretation of the statute to be so enforced as well.\xe2\x80\x9d  532 U. S., at 284.  In <em>Adams Fruit Co., supra,</em> at 646\xe2\x80\x93647, we rejected an agency interpretation of the worker-protection statute at issue as contrary to \xe2\x80\x9cthe plain meaning of the statute\xe2\x80\x99s language.\xe2\x80\x9d  Given the differences in statutory language, context, and history, those two cases are simply beside the point.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our analysis does not change in this case simply because the practice deemed unreasonable (and hence unlawful) in the 2003 Payphone Order is violation of an FCC regulation adopted under authority of a separate statutory section, \xc2\xa7276.  The FCC here, acting under the authority of \xc2\xa7276, has prescribed a particular rate (and a division of revenues) applicable to a portion of a long-distance service, and it has ordered carriers to reimburse payphone operators for the relevant portion of the service they jointly provide.  But the conclusion that it is \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d to fail so to reimburse is not a \xc2\xa7276 conclusion; it is a \xc2\xa7201(b) conclusion.  And courts have treated a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to follow closely analogous agency rate and rate-division determinations as we treat the matter at issue here.  That is to say, the FCC properly implements \xc2\xa7201(b) when it reasonably finds that the failure to follow a Commission, <em>e.g.</em>, rate or rate-division determination made under a <em>different </em>statutory provision is unjust or unreasonable under \xc2\xa7201(b).  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp.</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1414 (failure to follow a rate promulgated under \xc2\xa7205 properly considered unreasonable under \xc2\xa7201(b)); see also <em>Baltimore &amp; O. R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Alabama Great Southern R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em>, 506 F.\xc2\xa02d 1265, 1270 (CADC 1974)<em> </em>(statutory obligation to provide reasonable rate divisions is \xe2\x80\x9cimplemented by orders of the ICC\xe2\x80\x9d issued pursuant to a <em>separate</em> statutory provision).  Moreover, in resting our conclusion upon the analogy with rate setting and rate divisions, the traditional, historical subject matter of \xc2\xa7201(b), we avoid authorizing the FCC to turn \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 207 into a back-door remedy for violation of FCC regulations.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Second, Justice Scalia, dissenting, says that the \xe2\x80\x9conly serious issue presented by this case [is] whether a practice that is <em>not </em>in and of itself unjust or unreasonable can be rendered such (and thus rendered in violation of the Act itself) because it violates a substantive regulation of the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x933.  He answers this question \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d because, in his view, a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of a substantive regulation promulgated by the Commission is not a violation of the Act, and thus does not give rise to a private cause of action.<em>\xe2\x80\x9d</em> <em>Post</em>, at 3.  We cannot accept either Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s statement of the \xe2\x80\x9cserious issue\xe2\x80\x9d or his answer.  </p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">We do not accept his statement of the issue because whether the practice is \xe2\x80\x9cin and of itself\xe2\x80\x9d unreasonable is irrelevant.  The FCC has authoritatively ruled that carriers must compensate payphone operators.  The only practice before us, then, and the only one we consider, is the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s violation of that FCC regulation requiring the carrier to pay the payphone operator a fair portion of the total cost of carrying a call that they jointly carried\xe2\x80\x94each supplying a partial portion of the total carriage.  A practice of violating the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s order to pay a fair share would seem fairly characterized in ordinary English as an \xe2\x80\x9cunjust practice,\xe2\x80\x9d so why should the FCC not call it the same under \xc2\xa7201(b)?  </f></p>\n<p>\n\nNor can we agree with Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s claim that a \xe2\x80\x9cviolation of a <em>substantive regulation</em> promulgated by the Commission is not a violation of\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa7201(b) of the Act when, as here, the Commission has explicitly and reasonably ruled that the particular regulatory violation <em>does</em> violate \xc2\xa7201(b).  (Emphasis added.)  And what has the substantive/interpretive distinction that Justice Scalia emphasizes, <em>post</em>, at 3, to do with the matter?  There is certainly no reference to this distinction in \xc2\xa7201(b); the text does not suggest that, of all violations of regulations, only violations of <em>interpretive</em> regulations can amount to unjust or unreasonable practices.  Why believe that Congress, which scarcely knew of this distinction a century ago before the blossoming of administrative law, would care which kind of regulation was at issue?  And even if this distinction were relevant, the FCC has long set forth what we now would call \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d (or \xe2\x80\x9clegislative\xe2\x80\x9d) rules under \xc2\xa7205.  Cf. 1 R. Pierce, Administrative Law Treatise \xc2\xa76.4, p. 325 (4th ed. 2002); <em>post</em>, at 4.<em> </em>And violations of those substantive \xc2\xa7205 regulations have clearly been deemed violations of \xc2\xa7201(b).  <em>E.g</em>., <em>MCI Telecommunications Corp.</em>, 59 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1414.  Conversely, we have found no case at all in which a private plaintiff was kept out of federal court because the \xc2\xa7201(b) violation it challenged took the form of a \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive regulation\xe2\x80\x9d rather than an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretive regulation.\xe2\x80\x9d  Insofar as Justice Scalia uses adjectives such as \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9ctextually based\xe2\x80\x9d to describe his distinctions, <em>post</em>, at 4,<em> </em>and \xe2\x80\x9cnovel\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cabsurd\xe2\x80\x9d to describe ours, <em>post</em>, at 5, 2,  we would simply note our disagreement.</p>\n<p>\n\nWe concede that Justice Scalia cites three sources in support of his theory.  See <em>post</em>, at 3.  But, in our view, those sources offer him no support.  None of those sources involved an FCC application of, or an FCC interpretation of, the section at issue here, namely \xc2\xa7201(b).  Nor did any involve a regulation\xe2\x80\x94substantive or interpretive\xe2\x80\x94promulgated subsequent to the authority of \xc2\xa7201(b).  Thus none is relevant to the case at hand.  See <em>APCC Servs., Inc.</em> v. <em>Sprint Communications Co.</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1238, 1247 (CADC 2005) <em>(per curiam)</em> (\xe2\x80\x9cThere was no authoritative interpretation of \xc2\xa7201(b) in this case\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Greene</em> v. <em>Sprint Communications Co.</em>, 340 F.\xc2\xa03d 1047, 1052 (CA9 2003) (violation of substantive regulation does not violate \xc2\xa7276; silent as to \xc2\xa7201(b)).  The single judge who thought that the FCC had authoritatively interpreted \xc2\xa7201(b) (as has occurred in the case before us) would have reached the same conclusion that we do.  <em>APCC Servs., Inc.</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1254. (D. H. Ginsburg, C. J., dissenting) (finding a private cause of action, because there <em>was</em> \xe2\x80\x9cclearly an authoritative interpretation of \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x9d that deemed the practice in question unlawful).   See also Huber \xc2\xa73.14.3, p. 317 (no discussion of \xc2\xa7201(b)).</p>\n<p>\n\nThird, Justice Thomas (who also does not adopt Justice Scalia\xe2\x80\x99s arguments) disagrees with the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpractice.\xe2\x80\x9d  He, along with Global Crossing, claims instead that \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(a) and (b) concern only practices that harm carrier <em>customers, </em>not carrier <em>suppliers</em>.  <em>Post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x934 (dissenting opinion); Brief for Petitioner 37\xe2\x80\x9338.  But that is not what those sections say.  Nor does history offer this position significant support.  A violation of a regulation or order dividing rates among railroads, for example, would likely have harmed another carrier, not a shipper.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Chicago &amp; North Western Transp. Co.,</em> 609 F. 2d, at<em> </em>1225\xe2\x80\x931226 (\xe2\x80\x9cAct \xe2\x80\xa6 provides for the regulation of inter-carrier relations as a part of its general rate policy\xe2\x80\x9d).  Once one takes account of this fact, it seems reasonable, not unreasonable, to include as a \xc2\xa7201(b) (and \xc2\xa7207) beneficiary a firm that performs services roughly analogous to the transportation of one segment of a longer call.  We are not here dealing with a firm that supplies office supplies or manual labor.  Cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Missouri Pacific R. Co.</em> v. <em>Norwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/249/index.html">283 U. S. 249</a>, 257 (1931) (\xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa71 of the Interstate Commerce Act does not encompass employment decisions).  The long-distance carrier ordered by the FCC to compensate the payphone operator is so ordered in its role as a provider of communications services, not as a consumer of office supplies or the like.  It is precisely because the carrier and the payphone operator <em>jointly</em> provide a communications service to the caller that the carrier is ordered to share with the payphone operator the revenue that only the carrier is permitted to demand from the caller.  Cf. <em>Cable &amp; Wireless P. L. C.</em>, 166 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1231 (finding that \xc2\xa7201(b) enables the Commission to regulate not \xe2\x80\x9conly the terms on which U. S. carriers offer telecommunication services to the public,\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cthe prices U. S. carriers pay\xe2\x80\x9d to foreign carriers providing the foreign segment of an international call).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 Fourth, Global Crossing argues that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d determination is unlawful because it is inadequately reasoned.  We concede that the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s initial opinion simply states that the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s practice is unreasonable under \xc2\xa7201(b).  But the context and cross-referenced opinions, 2003 Payphone Order, 18 FCC Rcd., at 19990, \xc2\xb632 (citing <em>American Public Communications Council </em>v. <em>FCC</em>, 215 F.\xc2\xa03d 51, 56 (CADC 2000)), make the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s rationale obvious, namely, that in light of the history that we set forth <em>supra</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x939, it is unreasonable for a carrier to violate the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s mandate that it pay compensation.  See also <em>In re</em> <em>APCC Servs., Inc.</em> v. <em>NetworkIP, LLC</em>, 21 FCC Rcd. 10488, 10493\xe2\x80\x9310495, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6 13\xe2\x80\x9316 (2006) (Order) (spelling out the reasoning).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Fifth Global Crossing argues that a different statutory provision, \xc2\xa7276, see <em>supra</em>, at 5, prohibits the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s \xc2\xa7201(b) classification.  Brief for Petitioner 26\xe2\x80\x9328.  But \xc2\xa7276 simply requires the FCC to \xe2\x80\x9ctake all actions necessary \xe2\x80\xa6 to prescribe regulations that \xe2\x80\xa6 establish a per call compensation plan to ensure\xe2\x80\x9d that payphone operators \xe2\x80\x9care fairly compensated.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7276(b)(1).  It nowhere forbids the FCC to rely on \xc2\xa7201(b).  Rather, by helping to secure enforcement of the mandated regulations the FCC furthers basic \xc2\xa7276 purposes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, Global Crossing seeks to rest its claim of a \xc2\xa7276 prohibition upon the fact that \xc2\xa7276 requires regulations that secure compensation for \xe2\x80\x9cevery completed <em>intrastate</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d as well as every \xe2\x80\x9c<em>interstate</em>\xe2\x80\x9d payphone-related call, while \xc2\xa7201(b) (referring to \xc2\xa7201(a)) extends only to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>interstate or foreign</em>\xe2\x80\x9d<em> </em>communication.  Brief for Petitioner 37.  But Global Crossing makes too much of too little.  We can assume (for argument\xe2\x80\x99s sake) that \xc2\xa7201(b) may consequently apply only to a <em>portion </em>of the Compensation Order\xe2\x80\x99s requirements.  But cf., <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Louisiana Pub. Serv. Comm\xe2\x80\x99n</em>, 476 U. S., at 375, n.\xc2\xa04 (suggesting approval of FCC authority where it is \xe2\x80\x9c<em>not</em> possible to separate the interstate and the intrastate components\xe2\x80\x9d).  But even if that is so (and we repeat that we do not decide this question), the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s classification will help to achieve a substantial portion<em> </em>of its \xc2\xa7276 compensatory mission.  And we cannot imagine why Congress would have (implicitly in this \xc2\xa7276 language) wished to forbid the FCC from concluding that an interstate half loaf is better than none.  </p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For these reasons, the judgment of the Ninth Circuit is affirmed.</p>\n<p>\n<right><em>It is so ordered.<right></right></em></right></p><em>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">APPENDIXES TO OPINION OF THE COURT</f></p>\n<p>\n\nA</p>\n</em><p align="left"><em>In\xc2\xa0re Implementation of the Pay Telephone Reclassification and Compensation Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,</em> 14 FCC Rcd. 2545, 2631\xe2\x80\x932632, \xc2\xb6\xc2\xb6190\xe2\x80\x93191 (1999) (Compensation Order).</p>\n<p>\n<em>In\xc2\xa0re the Pay Telephone Reclassification and Compensation Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996,</em> 18 FCC Rcd. 19975, 19990, \xc2\xb632 (2003) (2003 Payphone Order).</p>\n<p align="left">\n<f f="Century Schoolbook">B</f></p>\n<p align="left">Communications Act \xc2\xa7201:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(a) It shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to furnish such communication service upon reasonable request therefor; and, in accordance with the orders of the Commission, in cases where the Commission, after opportunity for hearing, finds such action necessary or desirable in the public interest, to establish physical connections with other carriers, to establish through routes and charges applicable thereto and the divisions of such charges, and to establish and provide facilities and regulations for operating such through routes.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9c(b) All charges, practices, classifications, and regulations for and in connection with such communication service, shall be just and reasonable, and any such charge, practice, classification, or regulation that is unjust or unreasonable is declared to be unlawful: <em>Provided</em>, That communications by wire or radio subject to this chapter may be classified into day, night, repeated, unrepeated, letter, commercial, press, Government, and such other classes as the Commission may decide to be just and reasonable, and different charges may be made for the different classes of communications: <em>Provided further</em>, That nothing in this chapter or in any other provision of law shall be construed to prevent a common carrier subject to this chapter from entering into or operating under any contract with any common carrier not subject to this chapter, for the exchange of their services, if the Commission is of the opinion that such contract is not contrary to the public interest: <em>Provided further</em>, That nothing in this chapter or in any other provision of law shall prevent a common carrier subject to this chapter from furnishing reports of positions of ships at sea to newspapers of general circulation, either at a nominal charge or without charge, provided the name of such common carrier is displayed along with such ship position reports.

Pursuant to that authority, the FCC promulgated a substantive regulation that required carriers to compensate payphone operators at a rate of 24 cents per call (the payphone-compensation regulation).  The FCC subsequently declared a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to comply with the payphone-compensation regulation to be unlawful under \xc2\xa7201(b) of the Act (which prohibits certain \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d practices) and privately actionable under \xc2\xa7206 of the Act (which establishes a private cause of action for violations of the Act).  Today\xe2\x80\x99s judgment can be defended only by accepting either of two propositions with respect to these laws: (1) that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay the prescribed compensation, in and of itself and apart from the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s payphone-compensation regulation, is an unjust or unreasonable practice in violation of \xc2\xa7201(b); or (2) that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay the prescribed compensation is an \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d practice under \xc2\xa7201(b) because it violates the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s payphone-compensation regulation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court coyly avoids rejecting the first proposition.  But make no mistake: that proposition is utterly implausible, which is perhaps why it is nowhere to be found in the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  The unjustness or unreasonableness in this case, if any, consists precisely of violating the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s payphone-compensation regulation.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Absent that regulation, it would be neither unjust nor unreasonable for a carrier to decline to act as collection agent for payphone companies.  The person using the services of the payphone company to obtain access to the carrier\xe2\x80\x99s network is not the carrier but the caller.  It is absurd to suggest some natural obligation on the part of the carrier to identify payphone use, bill its customer for that use, and forward the proceeds to the payphone company.  As a regulatory command, that makes sense (though the free-rider problem might have been solved in some other fashion); but, absent the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s substantive regulation, it would be in no way unjust or unreasonable for the carrier to do nothing.  Indeed, if a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay payphone compensation had been<em> </em>unjust or unreasonable in its own right, the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s payphone-compensation regulation would have been unnecessary, and the payphone companies could have sued directly for violation of \xc2\xa7201(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The only serious issue presented by this case relates to the second proposition: whether a practice that is <em>not</em> in and of itself unjust or unreasonable can be rendered such (and thus rendered in violation of the Act itself) because it violates a substantive regulation of the Commission.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion seems to answer that question in the affirmative, at least with respect to the particular regulation at issue here.  That conclusion, however, conflicts with the Communications Act\xe2\x80\x99s carefully delineated remedial scheme.  The Act draws a clear distinction between private actions to enforce <em>interpretive</em> <em>regulations </em>(by which I mean regulations that reasonably and authoritatively construe the statute itself) and<em> </em>private actions to enforce <em>substantive</em> <em>regulations </em>(by which I mean regulations promulgated pursuant to an express delegation of authority to impose freestanding legal obligations beyond those created by the statute itself).  Section 206 of the Act establishes a private cause of action for violations of the Act itself\xe2\x80\x94and violation of an FCC regulation authoritatively interpreting the Act <em>is</em> a violation of the Act itself.  (As the Court explains, when it comes to regulations that \xe2\x80\x9creasonabl[y] [and] authoritatively construe the statute itself,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Alexander</em> v. <em>Sandoval</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/532/275/index.html">532 U. S. 275</a>, 284 (2001), \xe2\x80\x9cit is \xe2\x80\x98meaningless to talk about a separate cause of action to enforce the regulations apart from the statute.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d <em>Ante</em>, at 8 (quoting <em>Sandoval, supra</em>, at 284).)  On the other hand, violation of a substantive regulation promulgated by the Commission is not a violation of the Act, and thus does not give rise to a private cause of action under \xc2\xa7206.  See, <em>e.g.,</em> <em>APCC Servs., Inc. </em>v. <em>Sprint Communications Co.</em>, 418 F.\xc2\xa03d 1238, 1247 (CADC 2005) <em>(per curiam),</em> cert. pending, No. 05\xe2\x80\x93766; <em>Greene</em> v. <em>Sprint Communications Co.</em>, 340 F.\xc2\xa03d 1047, 1052 (CA9 2003), cert. denied, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/988/index.html">541 U. S. 988</a> (2004); P. Huber, M. Kellogg, &amp; J. Thorne, Federal Telecommunications Law \xc2\xa73.14.3 (2d ed. 1999).[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  That is why Congress has separately created private rights of action for violation of <em>certain</em> substantive regulations.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, 47 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7227(b)(3) (violation of substantive regulations prescribed under \xc2\xa7227(b) (2000 ed. and Supp. III)); \xc2\xa7227(c)(5) (violation of substantive regulations prescribed under \xc2\xa7227(c)).  These do not include the payphone-compensation regulation authorized by \xc2\xa7276(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0There is no doubt that interpretive rules can be issued pursuant to \xc2\xa7201(b)\xe2\x80\x94that is, rules which specify that certain practices are in and of themselves \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Orders issued under \xc2\xa7205 of the Act, see <em>ante</em>, at 14, which authorizes the FCC, <em>upon finding that a practice will be unjust and unreasonable,</em> to order the carrier to adopt a just and reasonable practice in its place, similarly implement the statute\xe2\x80\x99s proscription against unjust or unreasonable practices.  But, as explained above, the payphone-compensation regulation does not implement \xc2\xa7201(b) and is not predicated on a finding of what would be unjust and unreasonable absent the regulation.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court naively describes the question posed by this case as follows: Since \xe2\x80\x9c[a] practice of violating the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s order to pay a fair share would seem fairly characterized in ordinary English as an \xe2\x80\x98unjust practice,\xe2\x80\x99 . . . why should the FCC not call it the same under \xc2\xa7201(b)?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante,</em> at 15.  There are at least three reasons why it is not as simple as that.  (1) There has been no FCC \xe2\x80\x9corder\xe2\x80\x9d in the ordinary sense, see 5 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7551(6), but only an FCC regulation.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  That is to say, the FCC has never determined that petitioner is in violation of its regulation and ordered compliance.  Rather, respondent has alleged such a violation and has brought that allegation directly to District Court without prior agency adjudication.  (2) The \xe2\x80\x9cpractice of violating\xe2\x80\x9d virtually any FCC regulation can be characterized (\xe2\x80\x9cin ordinary English\xe2\x80\x9d) as an \xe2\x80\x9cunjust practice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94or if not that, then an \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable practice\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94so that <em>all </em>FCC regulations become subject to private damage actions.  Thus, the traditional (and textually based) distinction between private enforceability of interpretive rules, and private nonenforceability of substantive rules is effectively destroyed.  And (3) it is not up to the FCC to \xe2\x80\x9ccall it\xe2\x80\x9d an unjust practice or not.  If it were, agency discretion might limit the regulations available for harassing litigation by telecommunications competitors.  In fact, however, the practice of violating one or another substantive rule either <em>is </em>or <em>is not </em>an unjust or unreasonable practice under \xc2\xa7201(b).  The Commission is entitled to <em>Chevron </em>deference with respect to that determination at the margins, see <em>Chevron U. S.\xc2\xa0A. Inc. </em>v. <em>Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/837/index.html">467 U. S. 837</a> (1984), but it will always remain within the power of private parties to go directly to court, asserting that a particular violation of a substantive rule is (\xe2\x80\x9cin ordinary English\xe2\x80\x9d) \xe2\x80\x9cunjust\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d and hence provides the basis for suit under<em> </em>\xc2\xa7201(b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court asks (more naively still) \xe2\x80\x9cwhat has the substantive/interpretive distinction that [this dissent] emphasizes to do with the matter?  There is certainly no reference to this distinction in \xc2\xa7201(b) \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0. Why believe that Congress, which scarcely knew of this distinction a century ago before the blossoming of administrative law, would care which kind of regulation was at issue?\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316 (citation omitted).  The answer to these questions is obvious.  Section 206 (which was enacted at the same time as \xc2\xa7201(b), see 48 Stat. 1070, 1072) does not <em>explicitly</em> refer to the distinction between interpretive and substantive regulations.  And yet the Court acknowledges that, while a violation of an <em>interpretive</em> regulation is actionable under \xc2\xa7206 (as a violation of the statute itself), a violation of a <em>substantive</em> regulation is not.  (Were this not true, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy discussion of \xc2\xa7201(b) would be wholly unnecessary because violation of the payphone-compensation regulation would be directly actionable under \xc2\xa7206.)  The Court evidently believes that Congress went out of its way to exclude from \xc2\xa7206 private actions that did not charge violation of the Act itself (or regulations that authoritatively interpret the Act) but was perfectly willing to have those very same private actions brought in through the back door of \xc2\xa7201(b) as an \xe2\x80\x9cinterpretation\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable practice.\xe2\x80\x9d  It does not take familiarity with \xe2\x80\x9cthe blossoming of administrative law\xe2\x80\x9d to perceive that this would be nonsensical.[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Seemingly aware that it is in danger of rendering the limitation upon \xc2\xa7206 a nullity, the Court seeks to limit its novel approval of private actions for violation of substantive rules to substantive rules that are \xe2\x80\x9c<em>analog[ous] with rate-setting and rate divisions, the traditional, historical subject matter of \xc2\xa7201(b)</em>,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 14\xe2\x80\x9315 (emphasis added).\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0 There is absolutely no basis in the statute for this distinction (nor is it anywhere to be found in the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s opinion).  As I have described earlier, interpretive regulations are privately enforceable because to violate them <em>is </em>to violate the Act, within the meaning of the private-suit provision of \xc2\xa7206.  That a substantive regulation is <em>analogous</em> to traditional interpretive regulations, in the sense of dealing with subjects that those regulations have traditionally addressed, is supremely irrelevant to whether violation of the substantive regulation <em>is </em>a violation of the Act\xe2\x80\x94which is the only pertinent inquiry.  The only thing to be said for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s inventive distinction is that it enables its holding to stand without massive damage to the statutory scheme.  Better an irrational limitation, I suppose, than no limitation at all; even though it is unclear how restrictive that limitation will turn out to be.  What other substantive regulations are out there, one wonders, that can be regarded as \xe2\x80\x9canalogous\xe2\x80\x9d to actions the Commission has traditionally taken through interpretive regulations under \xc2\xa7201(b)?</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is difficult to comprehend what public good the Court thinks it is achieving by its introduction of an unprincipled exception into what has hitherto been a clearly understood statutory scheme.  Even without the availability of private remedies, the payphone-compensation regulation would hardly go unenforced.  The Commission is authorized to impose civil forfeiture penalties of up to $100,000 per violation (or per day, for continuing violations) against common carriers that \xe2\x80\x9cwillfully or repeatedly fai[l] to comply with \xe2\x80\xa6 any rule, regulation, or order issued by the Commission.\xe2\x80\x9d  47 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7503(b)(1)(B).  And the Commission can even place enforcement in private hands by issuing a privately enforceable order forbidding continued violation.  See \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7154(i), 276(b)(1)(A), 407.  Such an order, however, would require a prior Commission adjudication that the regulation had been violated, thus leaving that determination in the hands of the agency rather than a court, and preventing the unjustified private suits that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision allows.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I would hold that a private action to enforce an FCC regulation under \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7201(b) and 206 does not lie unless the regulated practice is \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d <em>in its own right </em>and apart from the fact that a substantive regulation of the Commission has prohibited it.  As the practice regulated by the payphone-compensation regulation does not plausibly fit that description, I would reverse the judgment of the Court of Appeals.</p>\n<casctfnt><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0See <em>In\xc2\xa0re the Pay Telephone Reclassification and Compensation Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996</em>, 18 FCC Rcd. 19975, 19990, \xc2\xb632 (2003) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ailure to pay in accordance with the Commission\xe2\x80\x99s payphone rules, such as the rules expressly requiring such payment \xe2\x80\xa6 constitutes \xe2\x80\xa6 an unjust and unreasonable practice in violation of section 201(b)\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>In\xc2\xa0re APCC Servs., Inc. </em>v.<em> NetworkIP, LLC, </em>21 FCC Rcd. 10488, 10493, \xc2\xb615 (2006) (\xe2\x80\x9c[F]ailure to pay payphone compensation rises to the level of being \xe2\x80\x98unjust and unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d because it is \xe2\x80\x9ca direct violation of Commission rules\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>id.</em>, at 10493, \xc2\xb615, and n. 46 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact that a failure to pay payphone compensation directly violates Commission rules specifically requiring such payment distinguishes this situation from other situations where the Commission has repeatedly declined to entertain \xe2\x80\x98collection actions\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a><p align="left">\xc2\xa0The Court asserts that \xe2\x80\x9c[n]one of th[ese] [cases] involved an FCC application of, or an FCC interpretation of, the relevant section, namely \xc2\xa7201(b)[,] nor did any involve a regulation\xe2\x80\x94substantive or interpretive\xe2\x80\x94promulgated subsequent to the authority of \xc2\xa7201(b).\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 16.

S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7201(b).  Properly understood, however, \xc2\xa7201 does not reach the conduct at issue here.  Failing to pay is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d under \xc2\xa7201 because that section regulates the activities of telecommunications firms in their role as <em>providers</em> of telecommunications services.  As such, \xc2\xa7201(b) does not reach the behavior of telecommunication firms in other aspects of their business.  I respectfully dissent.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The meaning of \xc2\xa7201(b) of the Communications Act of 1934 becomes clear when read, as it should be, as a part of the entirety of \xc2\xa7201.  Subsection (a) sets out the duties and broad discretionary powers of a common carrier:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be the duty of every common carrier engaged in interstate or foreign communication by wire or radio to furnish such communication service upon reasonable request therefor; and \xe2\x80\xa6 to establish physical connections with other carriers, to establish through routes and charges applicable thereto and the divisions of such charges, and to establish and provide facilities and regulations for operating such through routes.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nImmediately following that description of duties and powers, subsection (b) requires:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cAll charges, practices, classifications, and regulations for and in connection with such communication service, shall be just and reasonable, and any such charge, practice, classification, or regulation that\nis unjust or unreasonable is declared to be\nunlawful\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">\nThe \xe2\x80\x9ccharges, practices, classifications, and regulations\xe2\x80\x9d referred to in subsection (b) are those \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ed]\xe2\x80\x9d under subsection (a).  Having given common carriers discretionary power to set charges and establish regulations in subsection (a), Congress required in subsection (b) that the exercise of this power be \xe2\x80\x9cjust and reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Thus, unless failing to pay a payphone operator arises from one of the duties under subsection (a), it is not a \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d within the meaning of subsection (b).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Subsection (a) prescribes a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s duty to render service either to customers (\xe2\x80\x9cfurnish[ing] \xe2\x80\xa6 communication service\xe2\x80\x9d) or to other carriers (<em>e.g.</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cestablish[ing] physical connections\xe2\x80\x9d); it does not set out duties related to the receipt of service from suppliers.  Consequently, given the relationship between subsections (a) and (b), subsection (b) covers only those \xe2\x80\x9cpractices\xe2\x80\x9d connected with the <em>provision</em> of service to customers or other carriers.  The Court embraced this critical limitation in <em>Missouri Pacific R.\xc2\xa0Co.</em> v. <em>Norwood</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/283/249/index.html">283 U. S. 249</a> (1931), which held that the term \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d means a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98practice\xe2\x80\x99 in connection with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service to be rendered by the carriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 257.  In <em>Norwood</em>, the Court interpreted language from the Interstate Commerce Act (as amended by the Mann-Elkins Act)<em> </em>that Congress just three years later copied into the Communications Act.  <em>Ante</em>, at 3; see \xc2\xa77 of the Mann-Elkins Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 546.  In passing the Communications Act, Congress may \xe2\x80\x9cbe presumed to have had knowledge\xe2\x80\x9d and to have approved of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation in <em>Norwood.  </em>See <em>Lorillard</em> v. <em>Pons</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/434/575/index.html">434 U.

As a result, the Supreme Court\xe2\x80\x99s contemporaneous interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d should bear heavily on our analysis.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Other terms in \xc2\xa7201 support using <em>Norwood</em>\xe2\x80\x99s restrictive interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9cpractice.\xe2\x80\x9d  A word \xe2\x80\x9cis known by the company it keeps,\xe2\x80\x9d and one should not \xe2\x80\x9cascrib[e] to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Gustafson</em> v. <em>Alloyd Co.</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/513/561/index.html">513 U.

Of the quartet \xe2\x80\x9ccharges, practices, classifications, and regulations,\xe2\x80\x9d the terms \xe2\x80\x9ccharges,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cclassifications,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cregulations\xe2\x80\x9d could apply only to the party \xe2\x80\x9cfurnish[ing]\xe2\x80\x9d service.  \xe2\x80\x9c[C]harges\xe2\x80\x9d refers to the charges for physical connections and through routes.  47 U.

These three terms involve either setting rules for the provision of service or setting rates for that provision.  In keeping with the meaning of these terms, the term \xe2\x80\x9cpractices\xe2\x80\x9d must refer to only those practices \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service to be rendered by the carriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Norwood</em>,<em> supra,</em> at 257.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The statutory provisions surrounding \xc2\xa7201 confirm this interpretation.  Section 203 requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]very common carrier \xe2\x80\xa6 shall \xe2\x80\xa6 file with the Commission \xe2\x80\xa6 schedules showing all charges for itself and its connecting carriers \xe2\x80\xa6 and showing the classifications, practices, and regulations affecting such charges.\xe2\x80\x9d  See also \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7204\xe2\x80\x93205 (also using the phrase \xe2\x80\x9ccharge, classification, regulation, or practice\xe2\x80\x9d in the tariff context).  The \xe2\x80\x9ccharges\xe2\x80\x9d referred to are those related to a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s own services.  \xc2\xa7203 (\xe2\x80\x9ccharges for itself and its connecting carriers\xe2\x80\x9d).  The \xe2\x80\x9cclassifications, practices, and regulations\xe2\x80\x9d are also limited to a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s own services.  <em>Ibid. </em>(applying only to practices \xe2\x80\x9caffecting such charges\xe2\x80\x9d).  In this context, \xe2\x80\x9cpractices\xe2\x80\x9d must mean only those \xe2\x80\x9cin connection with the fixing of rates to be charged.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Norwood</em>, 283 U. S., at 257.  Section 202\xe2\x80\x94outside of the tariff context\xe2\x80\x94also supports this limitation.  It forbids discrimination \xe2\x80\x9cin charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services.\xe2\x80\x9d  Discrimination occurs with respect to a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s provision of service\xe2\x80\x94not its purchasing of services from others.  I am unaware of any context in which \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202\xe2\x80\x93205 were applied to conduct relating to the service that another party provided to a telecommunications carrier.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In this case, Global Crossing has not provided any service to Metrophones.  Rather, Global Crossing has failed to pay for a service that Metrophones supplied.  The failure to pay a supplier is not in any sense a \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98practice\xe2\x80\x99 in connection with the fixing of rates to be charged and prescribing of service to be rendered by the carriers.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 257.  Accordingly, Global Crossing has not engaged in a practice under subsection (b) because the failure to pay has not come in connection with its provision of service or setting of rates within the meaning of subsection (a).  On this understanding of \xc2\xa7201, Global Crossing\xe2\x80\x99s failure to pay Metrophones is not a statutory violation.  All that remains is a regulatory violation, which does not provide Metrophones a private right of action under \xc2\xa7207.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  </p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority suggests that deference under <em>Chevron U.

S. 837</a> (1984), compels its conclusion that a carrier\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to pay a payphone operator is unreasonable.  But \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d is a statutory term, \xc2\xa7201(b), and a court may not, in the name of deference, abdicate its responsibility to interpret a statute.  Under <em>Chevron</em>, an agency is due no deference until the court analyzes the statute and determines that Congress did not speak directly to the issue under consideration:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cThe judiciary is the final authority on issues of statutory construction and must reject administrative constructions which are contrary to clear congressional intent. \xe2\x80\xa6 If a court, employing traditional tools of statutory construction, ascertains that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 843, n.\xc2\xa09.</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority spends one short paragraph analyzing the relevant provisions of the Communications Act to determine whether a refusal to pay is an \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98unjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98practice.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7.  Its entire statutory analysis is essentially encompassed in a single sentence in that paragraph: \xe2\x80\x9cThat is to say, in ordinary English, one can call a refusal to pay Commission-ordered compensation despite having received a benefit from the payphone operator a \xe2\x80\x98practice \xe2\x80\xa6 in connection with [furnishing a] communication service \xe2\x80\xa6 that is \xe2\x80\xa6 unreasonable.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ibid.</em> (omissions and modifications in original).  This analysis ignores the interaction between \xc2\xa7201(a) and \xc2\xa7201(b), <em>supra,</em> at 1\xe2\x80\x932; it ignores the three terms surrounding the word \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d and the context those terms provide, <em>supra,</em> at 3\xe2\x80\x934; it ignores the use of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d in nearby statutory provisions, such as \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7202\xe2\x80\x93205, <em>supra,</em> at 4; and it ignores the understanding of the term \xe2\x80\x9cpractice\xe2\x80\x9d at the time Congress enacted the Communications Act, <em>supra,</em> at 2\xe2\x80\x933.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After breezing by the text of the statutory provisions at issue, the majority cites lower court cases to claim that \xe2\x80\x9cthe underlying regulated activity at issue here <em>resembles</em> activity that both transportation and communications agencies have long regulated.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 7\xe2\x80\x938 (citing <em>Allnet Communication Serv., Inc. </em>v. <em>National Exch.

It argues that these cases demonstrate that \xe2\x80\x9ccommunications firms entitled to revenues under rate divisions or cost allocations might bring lawsuits under \xc2\xa7207 \xe2\x80\xa6 and obtain compensation or damages.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 8.  But in both cases, the only issue before the court was whether the lawsuit should be dismissed because the FCC had primary jurisdiction; and in both cases, the answer was yes.  <em>Allnet</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 1120\xe2\x80\x931123; <em>Southwestern Bell</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 304\xe2\x80\x93306.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s reliance on these cases is thus entirely misplaced because both courts found they lacked jurisdiction; the cases do not address \xc2\xa7201 at all\xe2\x80\x94the interpretation of which is the sole question in this case; and both cases assume without deciding that \xc2\xa7207 applies, thus not grappling with the point for which the majority claims their support.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Finally, independent of the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation of the language \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpractice,\xe2\x80\x9d the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s interpretation is unreasonable because it regulates both interstate and intrastate calls.  The unjust-and-unreasonable requirement of \xc2\xa7201(b) applies only to \xe2\x80\x9cpractices \xe2\x80\xa6 in connection with such communication service,\xe2\x80\x9d and the term \xe2\x80\x9csuch communication service\xe2\x80\x9d refers to \xe2\x80\x9c<em>interstate</em> or foreign communication by wire or radio\xe2\x80\x9d in \xc2\xa7201(a) (emphasis added).  Disregarding this limitation, the FCC has applied its rule to both interstate and intrastate calls.  47 CFR \xc2\xa764.1300 (2005).  In light of the fact that the statute explicitly limits \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cpractices\xe2\x80\x9d to those involving \xe2\x80\x9cinterstate or foreign communication,\xe2\x80\x9d the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s application of \xc2\xa7201(b) to intrastate calls is plainly an unreasonable interpretation of the statute.  To make matters worse, the FCC has not even bothered to explain its clear misinterpretation.  See <em>In re Pay Telephone Reclassification and Compensation Provisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996</em>, 18 FCC Rcd. 19975 (2003).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The majority avoids directly addressing this argument by stating there is no reason \xe2\x80\x9cto forbid the FCC from concluding that an interstate half loaf is better than none.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 13.  But if the FCC\xe2\x80\x99s rule is unreasonable, Metrophones should not be able to recover for intrastate calls in a suit under \xc2\xa7207.  Because intrastate calls cannot be the subject of an \xe2\x80\x9cunjust or unreasonable\xe2\x80\x9d practice under \xc2\xa7201, there is no private right of action to recover for them, and the Court should cut off that half of the loaf.
