On appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the movement Whitfield required Parnell to make satisfied the forced-accompaniment requirement, rejecting his argument that \xc2\xa72113(e) requires \xe2\x80\x9csubstantial\xe2\x80\x9d movement.  </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0A bank robber \xe2\x80\x9cforces [a] person to accompany him,\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance, as was the case here.

We consider whether this provision applies when a bank robber forces someone to move with him over a short distance.</p><p>I</p><p>                    Petitioner Larry Whitfield, fleeing police after a botched bank robbery, entered the home of 79-year-old Mary Parnell through an unlocked door.  Once inside, he encountered a terrified Parnell and guided her from the hallway to a computer room (which Whitfield estimates was between four and nine feet away.  Brief for Petitioner 5).  There, Parnell suffered a fatal heart attack.  Whitfield fled, and was found hiding nearby.</p><p>                    A grand jury indicted Whitfield for, among other things, violating \xc2\xa72113(e) by forcing Parnell to accompany him in the course of avoiding apprehension for a bank robbery.

Brief for Appellant in No. 10\xe2\x80\x935217 (CA4),pp. 50\xe2\x80\x9352.  The Fourth Circuit disagreed, holding that, \xe2\x80\x9c[a]lthough Whitfield required Mrs. Parnell to accompany him for only a short distance within her own home, and for a brief period, no more is required to prove that a forced accompaniment occurred.\xe2\x80\x9d  695 F.\xc2\xa03d 288, 311 (2012).  After further proceedings in the District Court and Court of Appeals, 548 Fed.

Section 2113 has been amended frequently, but the relevant phrase\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cforces any person to accompany him without the consent of such person\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94has remained unchanged, and so presumptively retains its original meaning.  <i>Vermont Agency of Natural Resources</i> v. <i>United States ex rel. Stevens</i>,529 U.\xc2\xa0S. 765,783, n.12 (2000).</p><p>                    In 1934, just as today, to \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d someone meant to \xe2\x80\x9cgo with\xe2\x80\x9d him.  See Oxford English Dictionary 60 (1st ed. 1933) (defining \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d as: \xe2\x80\x9cTo go in company with, to go along with\xe2\x80\x9d).  The word does<i> </i>not, as Whitfield contends, connote movement over a substantial distance.  It was, and still is, perfectly natural to speak of accompanying someone over a relatively short distance, for example: from one area within a bank \xe2\x80\x9cto the vault\xe2\x80\x9d;[<a href="#F1">1</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cto the altar\xe2\x80\x9d at a wedding;[<a href="#F2">2</a>] \xe2\x80\x9cup the stairway\xe2\x80\x9d;[<a href="#F3">3</a>] or into, out of, or across a room.[<a href="#F4">4</a>]  English literature is replete with examples.  See, <i>e.g., </i>C. Dickens, David Copperfield 529 (Modern Library ed. 2000) (Uriah \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied me into Mr. Wickfield\xe2\x80\x99s room\xe2\x80\x9d); J. Austen, Pride and Prejudice 182 (Greenwich ed. 1982) (Elizabeth \xe2\x80\x9caccompanied her out of the room\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>                    It is true enough that accompaniment does not embrace minimal movement\xe2\x80\x94for example, the movement of a bank teller\xe2\x80\x99s feet when the robber grabs her arm.  It must constitute movement that would normally be described as from one place to another, even if only from one spot withina room or outdoors to a different one.  Here, Whitfield forced Parnell to accompany him for at least several feet, from one room to another.  That surely sufficed.</p><p>                    In an attempt to support his position that \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d should be read to mean \xe2\x80\x9caccompany over a substantial distance,\xe2\x80\x9d Whitfield observes that a forced-accompaniment conviction carries severe penalties: a mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. In 1934, a forced-accompaniment conviction could even be punished with death.  Act of May 18, 1934, ch. 304, \xc2\xa73,48Stat.783.  The severity of these sentences, Whitfield says, militates against interpreting subsection (e) to capture forced accompaniment occurring over a small distance.</p><p>                    But it does not seem to us that the danger of a forced accompaniment varies with the distance traversed.  Consider, for example, a hostage-taker\xe2\x80\x99s movement of one of his victims a short distance to a window, where she would be exposed to police fire; or his use of the victim as a human shield as he approaches the door.  And even if we thought otherwise, we would have no authority to add a limitation the statute plainly does not contain.  The Congress that wrote this provision may well have had most prominently in mind John Dillinger\xe2\x80\x99s driving off with hostages, but it enacted a provision which goes wellbeyond that.  It is simply not in accord with English usage to give \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d a meaning that covers only large distances.</p><p>                    Whitfield also contends that \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d must be read narrowly in light of \xc2\xa72113\xe2\x80\x99s graduated penalty scheme.  That scheme prescribes: (1) a 20-year maximum sentence for bank robbers who use \xe2\x80\x9cforce and violence\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cintimidation,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72113(a), (2) a 25-year maximum sentence for those who \xe2\x80\x9cassaul[t]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cpu[t] in jeopardy the life of\xe2\x80\x9d another \xe2\x80\x9cby the use of a dangerous weapon or device,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72113(d), and (3) a minimum sentence of 10 years, and a maximum sentence of life, for forced accompaniment, \xc2\xa72113(e).  According to Whitfield, bank robbers almost always \xe2\x80\x9cexert some control over the movement of the bank\xe2\x80\x99s employ-ees.\xe2\x80\x9d Brief for Petitioner 22.  Therefore, he says, unless \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d is limited to forced movement over sub-stantial distances, nearly all<i> </i>\xc2\xa72113 violations will be punishable under subsection (e), making subsections (a) and(d) pointless.</p><p>                    We disagree.  Even<i> </i>if Whitfield is right that bank robbers always \xe2\x80\x9cexert some control\xe2\x80\x9d over others, it does not follow that they always force others to <i>accompany</i> them somewhere\xe2\x80\x94that is, to go somewhere <i>with </i>them.  As we have no reason to think that to be the case, and because subsections (a), (d), and (e) all cover distinct conduct, our interpretation of \xe2\x80\x9caccompany\xe2\x80\x9d does not make any part of \xc2\xa72113 superfluous.</p><p>*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p><p>                    We hold that a bank robber \xe2\x80\x9cforces [a] person to accompany him,\xe2\x80\x9d for purposes of \xc2\xa72113(e), when he forces that person to go somewhere with him, even if the movement occurs entirely within a single building or over a short distance.  Defined in this manner, Whitfield forced Parnell to \xe2\x80\x9caccompany him.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72113(e).
