JUSTICE BLACKMUN announced the judgment of the Court and an opinion, in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, MR. JUSTICE WHITE, and MR. JUSTICE REHNQUIST join.</p>\n<p>This case presents the question whether a city which operates a public rapid transit system and sells advertising space for car cards on its vehicles is required by the First and Fourteenth Amendments to accept paid political advertising on behalf of a candidate for public office.</p>\n<p>In 1970, petitioner Harry J. Lehman was a candidate for the office of State Representative to the Ohio General Assembly for District 56.  The district includes the city of Shaker Heights.  On July 3, 1970, petitioner sought to promote his candidacy by purchasing car card space on the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit System for the months of August, September, and October.  The general election was scheduled for November 3.  Petitioner\'s proposed copy contained his picture and read:</p>\n<p><em>HARRY J. LEHMAN IS OLD-FASHIONED!\n</em></p>\n<p><em>ABOUT HONESTY, INTEGRITY AND GOOD\n</em></p>\n<p><em>GOVERNMENT\n</em></p>\n<p><em>State Representative District 66 [X] Harry J. Lehman.\n</em></p>\n<p>App. 39A.</p>\n<p>Advertising space on the city\'s transit system is managed by respondent Metromedia, Inc., as exclusive agent under contract with the city.  The agreement between the city and Metromedia provides:</p>\n<p>"15.  . . .  The CONTRACTOR shall not place political advertising in or upon any of the said CARS or in, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="300">Page 418 U. S. 300</a></p><p> upon or about any other additional and further space granted hereunder. [<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]"</p>\n<p>When petitioner applied for space, [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] he as informed by Metromedia that, although space was then available, the management agreement with the city did not permit political advertising. [<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]  The system, however, accepted ads from cigarette companies, banks, savings and loan associations, liquor companies, retail and service establishments, churches, and civic and public service oriented groups. [<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>]  There was uncontradicted testimony at the trial that, during the 26 years of public operation, the Shaker Heights system, pursuant to city council action, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="301">Page 418 U. S. 301</a></p><p> had not accepted or permitted any political or public issue advertising on its vehicles.  App. 30A-32A.</p>\n<p>When petitioner did not succeed in his effort to have his copy accepted, he sought declaratory and injunctive relief in the state courts of Ohio without success.  The Supreme Court of Ohio concluded that</p>\n<p>"the constitutionally protected right of free speech with respect to forums for oral speech, or the dissemination of literature on a city\'s streets, does not extend to commercial or political advertising on rapid transit vehicles."</p>\n<p>34 Ohio St.2d 143, 14146, 296 N.E.2d 683, 685 (1973).  There was no equal protection violation, the court said, because, "[a]s a class, all candidates for political office are treated alike under the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit System\'s commercial advertising policy."  <em>Id.</em> at 148, 296 N.E.2d at 686.  The three dissenting justices viewed the transit system\'s advertising space as a free speech forum, and would have held that no valid governmental interest was furthered by the differential treatment between political and other advertising.  A policy excluding political advertisements, in their view, would therefore deny political advertisers the equal protection of the law.  We granted certiorari in order to consider the important First and Fourteenth Amendment question the case presented. [<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]  414 U.S. 1021 (1973).</p>\n<p>It is urged that the car cards here constitute a public forum protected by the First Amendment, and that there is a guarantee of nondiscriminatory access to such publicly owned and controlled areas of communication "regardless of the primary purpose for which the area is dedicated."  Brief for Petitioner 14. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="302">Page 418 U. S. 302</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We disagree.  In <em>Packer Corp. v. Utah,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/105/case.html">285 U. S. 105</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/105/case.html#110">285 U. S. 110</a></span> (1932), Mr. Justice Brandeis, in speaking for a unanimous Court, recognized that "there is a difference which justifies the classification between display advertising and that, in periodicals or newspapers."  In <em>Packer,</em> the Court upheld a Utah statute that made it a misdemeanor to advertise cigarettes on "<em>any bill board, street car sign, street car, placard,\'" but exempted dealers\' signs on their places of business and cigarette advertising "`in any newspaper, magazine, or periodical.\'"  <em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/105/case.html#107">285 U. S. 107</a></span>.  The Court found no equal protection violation.  It reasoned that viewers of billboards and streetcar signs had no "choice or volition" to observe such advertising and had the message\n</em></p>\n<p>"thrust upon them by all the arts and devices that skill can produce. . . .  The radio can be turned off, but not so the billboard or street car placard."</p>\n<p><em>Id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/285/105/case.html#110">285 U.

In such situations, "[t]he legislature may recognize degrees of evil and adapt its legislation accordingly."  <em>Packer Corp. v.

Magistrates of Edinburgh,</em> [1913] Sess.Cas. 1059, 1073-1074, said:</p>\n<p>"[T]he truth is that open spaces and public places differ very much in their character, and before you could say whether a certain thing could be done in a certain place you would have to know the history of the particular place."</p>\n<p>Although American constitutional jurisprudence, in the light of the First Amendment, has been jealous to preserve access to public places for purposes of free speech, the nature of the forum and the conflicting interests involved have </p><p><a class="page-number" name="303">Page 418 U. S. 303</a></p><p> remained important in determining the degree of protection afforded by the Amendment to the speech in question.  <em>See, e.g., Cox v.

S. 376</a></span> (1973).</p>\n<p>Here, we have no open spaces, no meeting hall, park, street corner, or other public thoroughfare.  Instead, the city is engaged in commerce.  It must provide rapid, convenient, pleasant, and inexpensive service to the commuters of Shaker Heights.  The car card space, although incidental to the provision of public transportation, is a part of the commercial venture.  In much the same way that a newspaper or periodical, or even a radio or television station, need not accept every proffer of advertising from the general public, a city transit system has discretion to develop and make reasonable choices concerning the type of advertising that may be displayed in its vehicles.  In making these choices, this Court has held that a public utility</p>\n<p>"will be sustained in its protection of activities in public places when those activities do not interfere with the general public convenience, comfort and safety."</p>\n<p><em>Public Utilities Comm\'n v. Pollak,</em> 343 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/451/case.html#464">343 U. S. 464</a></span>-465.</p>\n<p>Because state action exists, however, the policies and practices governing access to the transit system\'s advertising space must not be arbitrary, capricious, or invidious.  Here, the city has decided that</p>\n<p>"[p]urveyors </p><p><a class="page-number" name="304">Page 418 U. S. 304</a></p><p> of goods and services saleable in commerce may purchase advertising space on an equal basis, whether they be house builders or butchers."</p>\n<p>34 Ohio St.2d at 146, 296 N.E.2d at 685.  This decision is little different from deciding to impose a 10-, 25-, or 35-cent fare, or from changing schedules or the location of bus stops, <em>Public Utilities Comm\'n v. Pollak,</em> 343 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/451/case.html#465">343 U. S. 465</a></span>.  Revenue earned from long-term commercial advertising could be jeopardized by a requirement that short-term candidacy or issue-oriented advertisements be displayed on car cards.  Users would be subjected to the blare of political propaganda.  There could be lurking doubts about favoritism, and sticky administrative problems might arise in parceling out limited space to eager politicians.  In these circumstances, the managerial decision to limit car card space to innocuous and less controversial commercial and service-oriented advertising does not rise to the dignity of a First Amendment violation.  Were we to hold to the contrary, display cases in public hospitals, libraries, office buildings, military compounds, and other public facilities immediately would become Hyde Parks open to every would-be pamphleteer and politician.  This the Constitution does not require.</p>\n<p>No First Amendment forum is here to be found.  The city consciously has limited access to its transit system advertising space in order to minimize chances of abuse, the appearance of favoritism, and the risk of imposing upon a captive audience.  These are reasonable legislative objectives advanced by the city in a proprietary capacity.  In these circumstances, there is no First or Fourteenth Amendment violation.</p>\n<p>The judgment of the Supreme Court of Ohio is affirmed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em> </p><p><a class="page-number" name="305">Page 418 U.

JUSTICE DOUGLAS, concurring in the judgment.</p>\n<p>Petitioner, a candidate for state office, attempted to purchase space for paid political advertising on vehicles of the Shaker Heights Rapid Transit System, a system owned and operated by the city of Shaker Heights, Ohio.  Metromedia, Inc., the exclusive advertising agent for the system, refused petitioner the space on the basis of a contract with the system prohibiting the acceptance of political advertisements.  Petitioner unsuccessfully sought injunctive relief in the state courts to restrain the city and Metromedia from refusing his advertising.</p>\n<p>The petitioner contends that, by selling advertising space, the city had turned its buses into free speech forum, and the city is now prohibited by the First Amendment, applicable to the States through the Fourteenth, [<a href="#F2/1" name="T2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>] from refusing space for political advertisements.</p>\n<p>My Brother BRENNAN would find that</p>\n<p>"[a] forum for communication was voluntarily established when the city installed the physical facilities for the advertisements and, by contract with Metromedia, created the necessary administrative machinery for regulating access to that forum."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/298/case.html#314">418 U. S. 314</a></span>.  If the streetcar or bus were a forum for communication akin to that of streets or public parks, considerable problems would be presented.</p>\n<p>"The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all . . . , but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied."</p>\n<p><em>Hague v. CIO,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html">307 U. S. 496</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/307/496/case.html#515">307 U. S. 515</a></span>-516.  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="306">Page 418 U. S. 306</a></p><p> But a streetcar or bus is plainly not a park or sidewalk or other meeting place for discussion, any more than is a highway.  It is only a way to get to work or back home.  The fact that it is owned and operated by the city does not, without more, make it a forum.</p>\n<p>Bus and streetcar placards are in the category of highway billboards, which have long been used to display an array of commercial and political messages.  But this particular form of communication has been significantly curtailed by state regulation adopted pursuant to the Highway Beautification Act of 1965, 23 U.S.C. \xc2\xa7 131, which conditions certain federal highway funds upon strict regulation of highway advertising.  Ohio is among the States which have sought to protect the interests of their motorists [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>] by enacting regulations pursuant to the Act.  Ohio Rev.Code Ann. \xc2\xa7 5516.01 <em>et seq.</em> (Supp. 1973).  The fact that land on which a billboard rests is municipal land does not curtail or enhance such regulatory schemes.</p>\n<p>If a bus is a forum, it is more akin to a newspaper than to a park.  Yet if a bus is treated as a newspaper, then, as we hold this date, <em>Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, ante,</em> p.  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/241/case.html">418 U. S. 241</a></span>, the owner cannot be forced to include in his offerings news or other items which outsiders may desire but which the owner abhors.  Newspaper cases are cited to support petitioner\'s claim.  The First Amendment, however, draws no distinction between press privately owned and press owned otherwise.  And if we are to turn a bus or streetcar into either a newspaper or a park, we take great liberties with people </p><p><a class="page-number" name="307">Page 418 U. S. 307</a></p><p> who, because of necessity, become commuters, and, at the same time, captive viewers or listeners.</p>\n<p>In asking us to force the system to accept his message as a vindication of his constitutional rights, the petitioner overlooks the constitutional rights of the commuters.  While petitioner clearly has a right to express his views to those who wish to listen, he has no right to force his message upon an audience incapable of declining to receive it.  In my view, the right of the commuters to be free from forced intrusions on their privacy precludes the city from transforming its vehicles of public transportation into forums for the dissemination of ideas upon this captive audience.</p>\n<p>Buses are not recreational vehicles used for Sunday chautauquas, as a public park might be used on holidays for such a purpose; they are a practical necessity for millions in our urban centers.  I have already stated this view in my dissent in <em>Public Utilities Comm\'n v. Pollak,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/451/case.html">343 U. S. 451</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/343/451/case.html#469">343 U.

One who hears disquieting or unpleasant programs in public places, such as restaurants, can get up and leave.  But the man on the streetcar has no choice but to sit and listen, or perhaps to sit and to try not to listen."</p>\n<p>There is no difference when the message is visual, not auricular.  In each, the viewer or listener is captive.</p>\n<p>I agree with Mr. Justice Brandeis, who, quoting from a Utah State Court decision, [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>] said that the visual message in streetcars is no different, for</p>\n<p>"\'[a]dvertisements of this sort are constantly before the eyes of observers </p><p><a class="page-number" name="308">Page 418 U. S. 308</a></p><p> on the streets and in street cars, to be seen without the exercise of choice or volition on their part.  Other forms of advertising are ordinarily seen as a matter of choice on the part of the observer. . . .

(App. 14A).  Although advertising space was available and Lehman\'s proposed advertisement [<a href="#F3/1" name="T3/1">Footnote 3/1</a>] met Metromedia\'s copy standards, [<a href="#F3/2" name="T3/2">Footnote 3/2</a>] rental space was nevertheless denied Lehman on </p><p><a class="page-number" name="310">Page 418 U.

For example,</p>\n<p>"[t]here may be some instances in which assemblies and petitions for redress of grievances are not consistent with other necessary purposes of public property.

The determination of whether a particular type of public property or facility constitutes a "public forum" requires the Court to strike a balance between the competing interests of the government, on the one hand, and the speaker and his audience, on the other. [<a href="#F3/3" name="T3/3">Footnote 3/3</a>]  Thus, the Court must assess the importance of the primary use to which the public property or facility is committed and the extent to which that use will be disrupted if access for free expression is permitted.

The privilege of a citizen of the United States to use the streets and parks for communication of views on national questions may be regulated in the interest of all; it is not absolute, but relative, and must be exercised in subordination to the general comfort and convenience, and in consonance with peace and good order; but it must not, in the guise of regulation, be abridged or denied."</p>\n<p><em>See also Jamison v.

By accepting commercial and public service advertising, the city effectively waived any argument that advertising in its transit cars is incompatible with the rapid transit system\'s primary function of providing transportation.  A forum for communication was voluntarily established when the city installed the physical facilities for the advertisements and, by contract with Metromedia, created the necessary administrative machinery for regulating access to that forum. [<a href="#F3/5" name="T3/5">Footnote 3/5</a>]</p>\n<p>The plurality opinion, however, contends that, as long as the city limits its advertising space to "innocuous and less controversial commercial and service oriented advertising," no First Amendment forum is created.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/418/298/case.html#304">418 U.

And while it is possible that commercial advertising may be accorded less First Amendment protection than speech concerning political and social issues of public importance, <em>compare Valentine v.

The city has failed to discharge that heavy burden in the present case.</p>\n<p>The Court\'s special vigilance is triggered in this case because of the city\'s undisputed ban against political advertising in its transit cars.  Commercial and public service advertisements are routinely accepted for display, while political messages are absolutely prohibited.  Few examples are required to illustrate the scope of the city\'s policy and practice.  For instance, a commercial advertisement peddling snowmobiles would be accepted, while a counter-advertisement calling upon the public to support legislation controlling the environmental destruction and noise pollution caused by snowmobiles would be rejected.  Alternatively, a public service ad by the League of Women Voters would be permitted, advertising the existence of an upcoming election and imploring citizens to vote, but a candidate, such as Lehman, would be barred from informing the public about his candidacy, qualifications for office, or position on particular issues.  These, and other examples, [<a href="#F3/10" name="T3/10">Footnote 3/10</a>] make perfectly clear that the selective </p><p><a class="page-number" name="318">Page 418 U. S. 318</a></p><p> exclusion of political advertising is not the product of evenhanded application of neutral "time, place, and manner" regulations.  Rather, the operative -- and constitutionally impermissible -- distinction is the message on the sign.  That conclusion is not dispelled by any of the city\'s asserted justifications for selectively excluding political advertising.</p>\n<p>The city contends that its ban against political advertising is bottomed upon its solicitous regard for "captive riders" of the rapid transit system, who are "forced to endure the advertising thrust upon [them]."  Brief for Respondents 8.  Since its rapid transit system is primarily a mode of transportation, the city argues that it </p><p><a class="page-number" name="319">Page 418 U. S. 319</a></p><p> may prohibit political advertising in order to shield its transit passengers from sometimes controversial or unsettling speech.  Whatever merit the city\'s argument might have in other contexts, it has a hollow ring in the present case, where the city has voluntarily opened its rapid transit system as a forum for communication.  In that circumstance, the occasional appearance of provocative speech should be expected.  Indeed, the Court has recognized that</p>\n<p>"a function of free speech under our system of government is to invite dispute. . . .  Speech is often provocative and challenging.  It may strike at prejudices and preconceptions, and have profound unsettling effects as it presses for acceptance of an idea."</p>\n<p><em>Terminiello v. Chicago,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/1/case.html">337 U. S. 1</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/337/1/case.html#4">337 U. S. 4</a></span> (1949).</p>\n<p>The line between ideological and nonideological speech is impossible to draw with accuracy.  By accepting commercial and public service advertisements, the city opened the door to "sometimes controversial or unsettling speech," and determined that such speech does not unduly interfere with the rapid transit system\'s primary purpose of transporting passengers.  In the eyes of many passengers, certain commercial or public service messages [<a href="#F3/11" name="T3/11">Footnote 3/11</a>] are as profoundly disturbing as some political advertisements might be to other passengers.  There is certainly no evidence in the record of this case indicating that political advertisements, as a class, are so disturbing when displayed that they are more likely than commercial or public service advertisements to impair the rapid transit system\'s primary function of transportation.  In the absence of such evidence, the city\'s selective exclusion of political advertising constitutes an invidious discrimination </p><p><a class="page-number" name="320">Page 418 U. S. 320</a></p><p> on the basis of subject matter, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.</p>\n<p>Moreover, even if it were possible to draw a manageable line between controversial and noncontroversial messages, the city\'s practice of censorship for the benefit of "captive audiences" still would not be justified. [<a href="#F3/12" name="T3/12">Footnote 3/12</a>]  This is not a case where an unwilling or unsuspecting rapid transit rider is powerless to avoid messages he deems unsettling.  The advertisements accepted by the city and Metromedia are not broadcast over loudspeakers in the transit cars.  The privacy of the passengers is not, therefore, dependent upon their ability "to sit and to try not to listen."  <em>Public Utilities Comm\'n v.

Surely that minor inconvenience </p><p><a class="page-number" name="321">Page 418 U.

The city argues that acceptance of</p>\n<p>"political advertisements in the cars of the Shaker Heights rapid transit, would suggest, on the one hand, some political favoritism is being granted to candidates who advertise, or, on the other hand, that the candidate so advertised is being supported or promoted by the government of the City."</p>\n<p>Brief for Respondents 8.  Clearly, such ephemeral concerns do not provide the city with <em>carte blanche</em> authority to exclude an entire category of speech from a public forum.</p>\n<p>"These pragmatic hurdles are no more relevant to a public forum when it is a motor coach than they are to a public park or a school auditorium.  The endorsement of an opinion expressed in an advertisement on a motor coach is no more attributable to the transit district than the view of a speaker in a public park is to the city administration or the tenets of an organization using school property for meetings is to the local school board."</p>\n<p><em>Wirta v.

A lumber company may advertise its wood products, but a conservation group cannot implore citizens to write to the President or Governor about protecting our natural resources.  An oil refinery may advertise its products, but a citizens\' organization cannot demand enforcement of existing air pollution statutes.  An insurance company may announce its available policies, but a senior citizens\' club cannot plead for legislation to improve our social security program.  The district would accept an advertisement from a television station that is commercially inspired, but would refuse a paid nonsolicitation message from a strictly educational television station.
