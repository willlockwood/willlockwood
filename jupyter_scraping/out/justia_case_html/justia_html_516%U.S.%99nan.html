The woman had been stabbed 29 times. Notified by the hunters, the Alaska state troopers issued a press release seeking assistance in identifying the body. Thompson called the troopers on September 11 to inform them that his former wife, Dixie Thompson, fit the description in the press release and that she had been missing for about a month. Through a dental examination, the troopers conclusively established that the corpse was Dixie Thompson. On September 15, a trooper called</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="103">103</a></p><p>Thompson and asked him to come to headquarters, purportedly to identify personal items the troopers thought belonged to Dixie Thompson. It is now undisputed, however, that the trooper\'s primary reason for contacting Thompson was to question him about the murder.</p><p>Thompson drove to the troopers\' headquarters in his pickup truck and, upon arriving, immediately identified the items as Dixie\'s. He remained at headquarters, however, for two more hours while two unarmed troopers continuously questioned him in a small interview room and tape-recorded the exchange. The troopers did not inform Thompson of his <i>Miranda </i>rights. Although they constantly assured Thompson he was free to leave, they also told him repeatedly that they knew he had killed his former wife. Informing Thompson that execution of a search warrant was underway at his home, and that his truck was about to be searched pursuant to another warrant, the troopers asked questions that invited a confession. App.43-79.1 Eventually, Thompson told the troopers he killed Dixie.</p><p>1 These passages from the transcript of the tape-recorded interrogation indicate the tenor of the questioning:</p><p>"Q Do you know--of course, I don\'t mean to take up a lot of your time, you-you can leave any time that you want to, if you\'ve got something else going on.</p><p>"A Oh no (indiscernible) around here, no.</p><p>"Q I know we called you and probably woke you up and ....

Some two hours later, the troopers arrested Thompson and charged him with first-degree murder.</p><p>The Alaska trial court, without holding an evidentiary hearing, denied Thompson\'s motion to suppress his September 15 statements. Tr. 118 (Dec. 12, 1986); Tr. 142 (Mar. 18, 1987). Deciding the motion on the papers submitted, the trial court ruled that Thompson was not "in custody" for <i>Miranda </i>purposes, therefore the troopers had no obligation to inform him of his <i>Miranda </i>rights. App.8-9.2 Applying an objective test to resolve the "in custody" question, the court asked whether" \'a reasonable person would feel he was not free to leave and break off police questioning.\'" <i>Id., </i>at 7 (quoting <i>Hunter </i>v. <i>State, </i>590 P. 2d 888,895 (Alaska 1979)). These features, the court indicated, were key: Thompson arrived at the station in response to a trooper\'s request; two unarmed troopers in plain clothes questioned him; Thompson was told he was free to go at any time; and he was not arrested at the conclusion of the interrogation. App. 7-8. Although the trial court held that, under the totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would have felt free to leave, it also observed that the troopers\' subsequent actions-releasing and shortly thereafter arresting Thompson-rendered the question "very close." <i>Id., </i>at 8-9.</p><p>After a trial, at which the prosecution played the taperecorded confession, the jury found Thompson guilty of first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. The Court of Appeals of Alaska affirmed Thompson\'s conviction, concluding, among other things, that the troopers had not placed Thompson "in custody," and therefore had no obligation to give him <i>Miranda </i>warnings. <i>Thompson </i>v. <i>State,</i></p><p>gonna (indiscernible) at you and it got turned around or just what happened. I mean I don\'t know those things .... " <i>Id., </i>at 49-51.</p><p>2 The trial court also rejected Thompson\'s contention that his confession was involuntary. On both direct and habeas review, Thompson unsuccessfully asserted the involuntariness of his confession. His petition to this Court, however, does not present that issue.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="106">106</a></p><p>768 P. 2d 127, 131 (Alaska App. 1989).3 The Alaska Supreme Court denied discretionary review. App. 24.</p><p>Thompson filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in the United States District Court for the District of Alaska. The District Court denied the writ, according a presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254(d) to the state court\'s conclusion that, when Thompson confessed, he was not yet "in custody" for <i>Miranda </i>purposes. App. 37. The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed without publishing an opinion. <a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/34/1073/">34 F.3d 1073</a> (1994). Based on Circuit precedent,4 the court held that "a state court\'s determination that a defendant was not in custody for purposes of <i>Miranda </i>is a question of fact entitled to the presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254(d)." App. 41.</p><p>Federal Courts of Appeals disagree on the issue Thompson asks us to resolve: whether state-court "in custody" determinations are matters of fact entitled to a presumption of correctness under 28 U.

See <i>Higgins </i>v. <i>State, </i>887 P. 2d 966, 971 (Alaska App. 1994); <i>McKillop </i>v. <i>State, </i>857 P. 2d 358, 361 (Alaska App. 1993).</p><p>4 The panel relied on <i>Krantz </i>v. <i>Briggs, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/983/961/">983 F.2d 961</a>, 964 <i>(CA9 1993), </i>which held that state-court "in custody" determinations warrant a presumption of correctness under \xc2\xa7 2254(d) if the state court made factfindings after a hearing on the merits.</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="107">107</a></p><p>1126 (1995).

S., at 467. To safeguard the uncounseled individual\'s Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, the <i>Miranda </i>Court held, suspects interrogated while in police custody must be told that they have a right to remain silent, that anything they say may be used against them in court, and that they are entitled to the presence of an attorney, either retained or appointed, at the interrogation. <i>Id., </i>at 444.

This category notably includes: competency to stand trial <i>(e. g., Maggio </i>v. <i>Fulford, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/111/case.html">462 U. S. 111</a>, 117 (1983) <i>(per curiam)); </i>and juror impartiality <i>(e. g., Witt, </i>469 U. S., at 429; <i>Patton </i>v. <i>Yount, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/case.html">467 U.

While these issues encompass more than "basic, primary, or historical facts," their resolution depends heavily on the trial court\'s appraisal of witness credibility and demeanor. See, <i>e. g., Witt, </i>469 U. S., at 429 (Although the trial court is "applying some kind of legal standard to what [it] sees and hears," its "predominant function in determining juror bias involves credibility findings whose basis cannot be easily discerned from an appellate record."). This Court has reasoned that a trial court is better positioned to make decisions of this genre, and has therefore accorded the judgment of the jurist-observer "presumptive weight." <i>Miller, </i>474 U. S., at 114 (when an "issue involves the credibility of witnesses and therefore turns largely on an evaluation of demeanor, there are compelling and familiar justifications for leaving the process of applying law to fact to the trial court").</p><p>On the other hand, the Court has ranked as issues of law for \xc2\xa7 2254(d) purposes: the voluntariness of a confession <i>(Miller, </i>474 U. S., at 116); the effectiveness of counsel\'s assistance <i>(Strickland </i>v. <i>Washington, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/466/668/case.html">466 U. S. 668</a>, 698 (1984)); and the potential conflict of interest arising out of an attorney\'s representation of multiple defendants <i>(Cuyler, 446 </i>U. S., at 341-342).

Two discrete inquiries are essential to the determination: first, what were the circumstances surrounding the interrogation; and second, given those circumstances,l1 would a reasonable person have felt he or she was not at liberty to terminate the interrogation and leave. Once the scene is set and the players\' lines and actions are reconstructed, the court must apply an objective test to resolve "the ultimate inquiry": "[was] there a \'formal arrest or restraint on freedom of movement\' of the degree associated with a formal arrest." <i>California </i>v. <i>Beheler, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1121/case.html">463 U.

State-court findings on these scene- and action-setting questions attract a presumption of correctness under 28 U. S. C. \xc2\xa7 2254(d). The second inquiry, however, calls for application of the controlling legal standard to the historical facts. This ultimate</p><p>11 The "totality of the circumstances" cast of the "in custody" determination, contrary to respondents\' suggestions, does not mean deferential review is in order. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Miller </i>v. <i>Fenton, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html">474 U.

As this case illustrates, the trial court\'s superior capacity to resolve credibility issues is not dispositive of the "in custody" inquiry.12 Credibility determinations, as in the case of the alleged involuntariness of a confession, see <i>Miller, </i>474 U. S., at 112, may sometimes contribute to the establishment of the historical facts and thus to identification of the "totality of the circumstances." But the crucial question entails an evaluation made after determination of those circumstances: if encountered by a "reasonable person," would the identified circumstances add up to custody as defined in <i>Miranda? </i>13</p><p>12 As earlier observed, see <i>supra, </i>at 105, the trial court decided Thompson\'s motion to suppress his September 15 statements on the papers submitted without holding an evidentiary hearing.</p><p>13 Respondents observe that "reasonable person" assessments, most prominently to gauge negligence in personal injury litigation, fall within the province of fact triers. See, <i>e.g., Cooter </i>&amp; <i>Gell, </i>496 U. S., at 402 (negligence determinations "generally reviewed deferentially"); <i>McAllister </i>v. <i>United States, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/348/19/case.html">348 U.

Traditionally, our legal system has entrusted negligence questions to jurors, inviting them to apply community standards. See W. Keeton, D. Dobbs, R. Keeton, &amp; D. Owen, Prosser and Keeton on Law of Torts \xc2\xa7 37, pp. 235-237 (5th ed. 1984). For that reason, "[t]he question usually is said to be one of fact," although "it should be apparent that the function of the jury in fixing the standard differs from that of the judge only in that it cannot be reduced to anything approaching a definite rule." <i>Id., </i>at 237.</p><p>Judges alone make "in custody" assessments for <i>Miranda </i>purposes, and they do so with a view to identifying recurrent patterns, and advancing uniform outcomes. If they cannot supply "a definite rule," they nonetheless can reduce the area of uncertainty. See, <i>e. g., Illinois </i>v. <i>Perkins, 496 </i>U.

S., at 116-117 ("[A]ssessments of credibility and demeanor are not crucial to the proper resolution of the ultimate issue of \'voluntariness.\' ").</p><p>Unlike the <i>voir dire </i>of a juror, <i>Patton, </i>467 U. S., at 1038, or the determination of a defendant\'s competency, <i>Maggio, </i>462 U. S., at 117, which "take[s] place in open court on a full record," <i>Miller, </i>474 U. S., at 117, the trial court does not have a first-person vantage on whether a defendant was "in custody" for <i>Miranda </i>purposes. See 474 U. S., at 117 (police interrogations yielding confessions ordinarily occur, not in court, but in an "inherently more coercive environment"). Furthermore, in fathoming the state of mind of a potential juror or a defendant in order to answer the questions, "Is she free of bias?," "Is he competent to stand trial?," the trial court makes an individual-specific decision, one unlikely to have precedential value.14 In contrast, "in custody" determinations do guide future decisions.15 We thus conclude</p><p>of police presence, is not coerced); <i>Berkemer </i>v. <i>McCarty, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/420/case.html">468 U.

For example, in <i>Cooter </i>&amp; <i>Gell </i>v. <i>Hartmarx Corp., </i>a decision confirming that the abuse-of-discretion standard applies to appellate review of sanctions under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, we observed that plenary review would likely" \'fail to produce the normal law-clarifying benefits that come from an appellate decision on a question of law ... .\'\'\' 496 U.

It would be anomalous to type the question differently when an individual complains that the state courts had erroneously constricted the circumstances that add up to an "in custody" conclusion.</p><p>Classifying "in custody" as a determination qualifying for independent review should serve legitimate law enforcement interests as effectively as it serves to ensure protection of the right against self-incrimination.

S. 293</a> (1963), overruled in part by <i>Keeney </i>v. <i>Tamayo-Reyes, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/504/1/case.html">504 U. S. 1</a>, 5 (1992), for distinguishing factual issues from mixed questions of law and fact, dictate a result either way in this case. See, <i>e. </i><i>g., </i><i>Wainwright </i>v. <i>Witt, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/469/412/case.html">469 U. S. 412</a>, 429 (1985) (juror bias determination is a question of fact, even though "[t]he trial judge is of course applying some kind of legal standard to what he sees and hears"); <i>Patton </i>v. <i>Yount, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/467/1025/case.html">467 U. S. 1025</a>, 1037, n. 12 (1984) (juror bias is a question of fact although "[t]here are, of course, factual and legal questions to be considered in deciding whether a juror is qualified"). Because the <i>Miranda </i>custody issue "falls somewhere between a pristine legal standard and a simple historical fact," we must decide, "as a matter of the sound administration of justice, [which] judicial actor is better positioned ... to decide the issue in question." <i>Miller </i>v. <i>Fenton, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/474/104/case.html">474 U. S. 104</a>, 114 (1985).</p><p>The state trial judge is, in my estimation, the bestpositioned judicial actor to decide the relatively straightforward and fact-laden question of <i>Miranda </i>custody. See <i>California </i>v. <i>Beheler, supra, </i>at 1128 (STEVENS, J., dissenting) (state "courts are far better equipped than we are to assess the police practices that are highly relevant to the determination whether particular circumstances amount to custodial</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="118">118</a></p><p>interrogation"). In making the custody determination, the state trial judge must consider a complex of diverse and case-specific factors in an effort to gain an overall sense of the defendant\'s situation at the time of the interrogation. These factors include, at a minimum, the location, timing, and length of the interview, the nature and tone of the questioning, whether the defendant came to the place of questioning voluntarily, the use of physical contact or physical restraint, and the demeanor of all of the key players, both during the interview and in any proceedings held in court. In assessing all of these facts, the state trial judge will often take live testimony, consider documentary evidence, and listen to audiotapes or watch videotapes of the interrogation. Assessments of credibility and demeanor are crucial to the ultimate determination, for the trial judge will often have to weigh conflicting accounts of what transpired. The trial judge is also likely to draw inferences, which are similarly entitled to deference, from "physical or documentary evidence or ... other facts." <i>Anderson </i>v. <i>Bessemer City, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/470/564/case.html">470 U. S. 564</a>, 574 (1985). The <i>Miranda </i>custody inquiry is thus often a matter of "shades and degrees," <i>Withrow </i>v. <i>Williams, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/680/case.html">507 U. S. 680</a>, 712 (1993) (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part), that requires the state trial judge to make any number of "\'fact-intensive, close calls.\'" <i>Cooter </i>&amp; <i>Gell </i>v. <i>Hartmarx Corp., </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/496/384/case.html">496 U. S. 384</a>, 404 (1990) (citation omitted).</p><p>The majority is quite right that the test contains an objective component-how a "reasonable man in the suspect\'s position would have understood his situation," <i>Stansbury </i>v. <i>California, supra, </i>at 324-but this alone cannot be dispositive of whether the determination should be reviewed deferentially. See, <i>e. g., Cooter </i>&amp; <i>Gell </i>v. <i>Hartmarx Corp., supra, </i>at 402 (Rule 11 and negligence determinations, both of which involve objective tests, are subject to deferential review). "[T]he line between pure facts ... and ... the application to them of a legal standard that is as non-technical-as commonsensical-as reasonableness is a faint one." <i>United</i></p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="119">119</a></p><p><i>States </i>v. <i>Humphrey, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/34/551/">34 F.3d 551</a>, 559 (CA7 1994) (Posner, C. J., concurring). It distorts reality to say that all of the subtle, factbound assessments that go into determining what it was like to be in the suspect\'s shoes simply go out the window when it comes time for the "ultimate inquiry," <i>ante, </i>at 112, of how a reasonable person would have assessed the situation. "The state trial court [is] in the unique position, after observing [the defendant] and listening to the evidence presented at trial, to determine whether a reasonable person in [defendant\'s] position would have felt free to leave the police station." <i>Purvis </i>v. <i>Dugger, </i><a class="appeallink" href="http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F2/932/1413/">932 F.2d 1413</a>, 1419 (CAll 1991), cert. denied, 503 U. S. 940 (1992). It is only in light of these case-specific determinations that the reasonable person test can be meaningfully applied. See <i>Cooter </i>&amp; <i>Gell </i>v. <i>Hartmarx Corp., supra, </i>at 402 ("Familiar with the issues and litigants, the [trial] court is better situated than the court of appeals to marshal the pertinent facts and apply the factdependent legal standard").</p><p>For these reasons, I have no doubt that the state trier of fact is best situated to put himself in the suspect\'s shoes, and consequently is in a better position to determine what it would have been like for a reasonable man to be in the suspect\'s shoes. Federal habeas courts, often reviewing the cold record as much as a decade after the initial determination, are in an inferior position to make this assessment. Though some of the state court\'s factual determinations may, perhaps, be reflected on the record, many of the case-specific assessments that underlie the state trial judge\'s ultimate determination are subtle, difficult to reduce to writing, and unlikely to be preserved in any meaningful way for review on appeal. "State courts are fully qualified to identify constitutional error and evaluate its prejudicial effect." <i>Brecht </i>v. <i>Abrahamson, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/507/619/case.html">507 U. S. 619</a>, 636 (1993). "Absent indication to the contrary, state courts should be presumed to have applied federal law as faithfully as federal courts." <i>Withrow </i>v. <i>Williams, supra, </i>at 723 (SCALIA, J., concurring in part and</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="120">120</a></p><p>dissenting in part). We insult our colleagues in the States when we imply, as we do today, that state judges are not sufficiently competent and reliable to make a decision as straightforward as whether a person was in custody for purposes of <i>Miranda. </i>See 507 U. S., at 714 (O\'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) ("We can depend on law enforcement officials to administer <i>[Miranda] </i>warnings in the first instance and the state courts to provide a remedy when law enforcement officers err").l</p><p>I also see no reason to remand this case to the Ninth Circuit for further analysis. There is no dispute that Thompson came to the police station voluntarily. There is no dispute that he was repeatedly told he could leave the police station at any time. And it is also clear that he left the police station freely at the end of the interrogation. In <i>California </i>v. <i>Beheler, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/463/1121/case.html">463 U. S. 1121</a> (1983) <i>(per curiam), </i>we held that a person is not in custody if "the suspect is not placed under arrest, voluntarily comes to the police station, and is allowed to leave unhindered by police after a brief interview." <i>Ibid. </i>And in <i>Oregon </i>v. <i>Mathiason, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/492/case.html">429 U. S. 492</a> (1977) <i>(per curiam), </i>we found it "clear" that the defendant was not in <i>Miranda </i>custody where he "came voluntarily to the police</p><p>1 The majority believes that federal oversight of state-court custody judgments is necessary to "advanc[e] uniform outcomes," and when that cannot be achieved, to "reduce the area of uncertainty." <i>Ante, </i>at 113, n. 13. While uniformity of outcome is a virtue worth pursuing generally, we determined in a line of cases beginning with <i>Teague </i>v. <i>Lane, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/489/288/case.html">489 U. S. 288</a> (1989) (plurality opinion), that on habeas, uniformity must give way to concerns of comity and finality. See <i>id., </i>at 310 ("The \'costs imposed upon the State[s] by retroactive application of new rules of constitutional law on habeas corpus ... generally far outweigh the benefits of this application\' ") (quoting <i>Solem </i>v. <i>Stumes, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/465/638/case.html">465 U. S. 638</a>, 654 (1984) (Powell, J., concurring in judgment)). Federal habeas review is not the time for fine-tuning constitutional rules of criminal procedure at the expense of valid state convictions based on reasonable applications of then-existing law. See <i>Butler </i>v. <i>McKellar, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/494/407/case.html">494 U. S. 407</a>, 414 (1990) ("The \'new rule\' principle ... validates reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents made by state courts").</p><hr/><p style="page-break-after:always"></p>\n<p><a class="page-name" name="121">121</a></p><p>station, ... was immediately informed that he was not under arrest," and "[a]t the close of a \'l2-hour interview ... did in fact leave the police station without hindrance." <i>Id., </i>at 495; see also <i>ibid. </i>("Nor is the requirement of warnings to be imposed simply because the questioning takes place in the station house, or because the questioned person is one whom the police suspect"). Because Thompson cannot establish a <i>Miranda </i>violation even under <i>de novo </i>review, I would resolve that question now, and avoid putting the State of Alaska to the uncertainty and expense of defending for the sixth time in nine years an eminently reasonable judgment secured against a confessed murderer.2</p><p>I respectfully dissent.</p><p>2 To the extent Thompson\'s claim has any merit at all, it seems certain that relief is barred by our decision in <i>Teague </i>v. <i>Lane, supra, </i>at 301, 310 (plurality opinion), and its progeny. "The interests in finality, predictability, and comity underlying our new rule jurisprudence may be undermined to an equal degree by the invocation of a rule that was not dictated by precedent as by the application of an old rule in a manner that was not dictated by precedent." <i>Stringer </i>v. <i>Black, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/503/222/case.html">503 U. S. 222</a>, 228 (1992). In this case, it is clear that "granting the relief sought would create a new rule because the prior decision is applied in a novel setting, thereby extending the precedent." <i>Ibid. </i>In light of <i>Beheler </i>and <i>Mathiason, </i>the State\'s judgment was, at the very least, reasonable. And <i>"Teague </i>insulates on habeas review the state courts\' \'\'\'reasonable, good-faith interpretations of existing precedents."\'" <i>Wright </i>v. <i>West, </i><a href="/cases/federal/us/505/277/case.html">505 U.
