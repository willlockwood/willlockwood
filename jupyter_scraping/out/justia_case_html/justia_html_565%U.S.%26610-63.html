Maples was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death in Alabama state court.  In 2001, Maples sought postconviction relief in state court under Alabama Rule 32.  Maples alleged, among other things, that his underpaid and inexperienced trial attorneys failed to afford him the effective assistance guaranteed by the \n \nSixth Amendment.  His petition was written by two pro bono attorneys, Jaasai Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, both associated with the New York offices of the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell law firm.  As required by Alabama law, the two attorneys engaged an Alabama lawyer, John Butler, to move their admission pro hac vice.  Butler made clear, however, that he would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn 2002, while Maples\xe2\x80\x99 state postconviction petition was pending, Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.  Their new employment disabled them from representing Maples.  They did not inform Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel.  In disregard of Alabama law, neither sought the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s leave to withdraw.  No other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney entered an appearance, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of a change in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 representation.  Thus, Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler remained Maples\xe2\x80\x99 listed, and only, attorneys of record.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe trial court denied Maples\xe2\x80\x99 petition in May 2003.  Notices of the order were posted to Munanka and Ingen-Housz at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s address.  When those postings were returned, unopened, the trial court clerk attempted no further mailing.  Butler also received a copy of the order, but did not act on it.  With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, the 42-day period Maples had to file a notice of appeal ran out.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAbout a month later, an Alabama Assistant Attorney General sent a letter directly to Maples.  The letter informed Maples of the missed deadline and notified him that he had four weeks remaining to file a federal habeas petition.  Maples immediately contacted his mother, who called Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.  Three Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys, through Butler, moved the trial court to reissue its order, thereby restarting the 42-day appeal period.  The court denied the motion.  The Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals then denied a writ of mandamus that would have granted Maples leave to file an out-of-time appeal, and the State Supreme Court affirmed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThereafter, Maples sought federal habeas relief.  Both the District Court and the Eleventh Circuit denied his request, pointing to the procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\xe2\x80\x99 failure timely to appeal the state trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying his Rule 32 petition for postconviction relief.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0Maples has shown the requisite \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse his procedural default.

But it is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples long before the default occurred.  Furthermore, because the attorneys did not seek the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s permission to withdraw, they allowed court records to convey that they remained the attorneys of record.  As such, the attorneys, not Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State asserts that, after Munanka\xe2\x80\x99s and Ingen-Housz\xe2\x80\x99s departure, other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys came forward to serve as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 counsel.  At the time of the default, however, those attorneys had not been admitted to practice in Alabama, had not entered their appearances on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, and had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen- Housz.  Thus, they lacked the legal authority to act on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf before his time to appeal expired.

Upon receiving a copy of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order, Butler did not contact Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action.  Nor did the State treat Butler as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 actual representative.  Notably, the Alabama Assistant Attorney General wrote directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel.

He in fact received none within the 42 days allowed for commencing an appeal.  Given no reason to suspect that he lacked counsel able and willing to represent him, Maples surely was blocked from complying with the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rule.

In the unusual circumstances of this case, agency law principles and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: there was indeed cause to excuse Maples\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default.

Maples is an Alabama capital prisoner sentenced to death in 1997 for the murder of two individuals.  At trial, he was represented by two appointed lawyers, minimally paid and with scant experience in capital cases.  Maples sought postconviction relief in state court, alleging ineffective assistance of counsel and several other trial infirmities.  His petition, filed in August 2001, was written by two New York attorneys serving pro bono, both associated with the same New York-based large law firm.  An Alabama attorney, designated as local counsel, moved  the admission of the out-of-state counsel pro hac vice.  As understood by New York counsel, local counsel would facilitate their appearance, but would undertake no substantive involvement in the case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn the summer of 2002, while Maples\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction petition remained pending in the Alabama trial court, his New York attorneys left the law firm; their new employment disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.  They did not inform Maples of their departure and consequent inability to serve as his counsel.  Nor did they seek the Alabama trial court\xe2\x80\x99s leave to withdraw.  Neither they nor anyone else moved for the substitution of counsel able to handle Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn May 2003, the Alabama trial court denied Maples\xe2\x80\x99 petition.  Notices of the court\xe2\x80\x99s order were posted to the New York attorneys at the address of the law firm with which they had been associated.  Those postings were re-turned, unopened, to the trial court clerk, who attempt- ed no further mailing.  With no attorney of record in fact acting on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, the time to appeal ran out.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThereafter, Maples petitioned for a writ of habeas  corpus in federal court.  The District Court and, in turn, the Eleventh Circuit, rejected his petition, pointing to the procedural default in state court, i.e., Maples\xe2\x80\x99 failure timely to appeal the Alabama trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order denying him postconviction relief.  Maples, it is uncontested, was blameless for the default.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe sole question this Court has taken up for review is whether, on the extraordinary facts of Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case, there is \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d to excuse the default.  Maples maintains that there is, for the lawyers he believed to be vigilantly representing him had abandoned the case without leave of court, without informing Maples they could no longer represent him, and without securing any recorded substitution of counsel.  We agree.  Abandoned by counsel, Maples was left unrepresented at a critical time for his state postconviction petition, and he lacked a clue of any need to protect himself pro se.  In these circumstances, no just system would lay the default at Maples\xe2\x80\x99 death-cell door.  Satisfied that the requisite cause has been shown, we reverse the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s judgment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tI\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlabama sets low eligibility requirements for lawyers appointed to represent indigent capital defendants at trial.

Maples pleaded not guilty, and his case proceeded to trial, where he was represented by two court-appointed Alabama attorneys.  Only one of them had earlier served in a capital case.  See Tr. 3081.  Neither counsel had previously tried the penalty phase of a capital case.  Compensation for each lawyer was capped at $1,000 for time spent out-of-court preparing Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case, and at $40 per hour for in-court services.  See Ala.

The vote was 10 to 2, the minimum number Alabama requires for a death recommendation.  See Ala.

Accepting the jury\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, the trial court sentenced Maples to death.  On direct appeal, the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals and the Alabama Supreme Court affirmed the convictions and sentence.  Ex\xc2\xa0parte Maples, 758 So.\xc2\xa02d 81 (Ala. 1999); Maples v.

At the time, Alabama required out-of-state attorneys to associate local counsel when seeking admission to practice pro hac vice before an Alabama court, regardless of the nature of the proceeding.

Notwithstanding his obligations under Alabama law, Butler  informed Munanka and Ingen-Housz, \xe2\x80\x9cat the outset,\xe2\x80\x9d that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of allowing the two New York attorneys to appear pro hac vice on behalf of Maples.

The Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys accepted Butler\xe2\x80\x99s conditions.  Id., at 257a.  This arrangement between out-of-state and local attorneys, it appears, was hardly atypical.  See Justices Brief 36 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe fact is that local counsel for out-of-state attorneys in post-conviction litigation most often do nothing other than provide the mechanism for foreign attorneys to be admitted.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWith the aid of his pro\xc2\xa0bono counsel, Maples filed a petition for postconviction relief under Alabama Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F4" name="T4">\n\t\t\t\t\t4\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  Among other claims, Maples asserted that his court-appointed attorneys provided con-stitutionally ineffective assistance during both guilt and penalty phases of his capital trial.  App. 29\xe2\x80\x93126.  He  alleged, in this regard, that his inexperienced and underfunded attorneys failed to develop and raise an obvious intoxication defense, did not object to several egregious instances of prosecutorial misconduct, and woefully underprepared for the penalty phase of his trial.  The State responded by moving for summary dismissal of Maples\xe2\x80\x99 petition.  On December 27, 2001, the trial court denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSome seven months later, in the summer of 2002, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell.

Neither attorney told Maples of their departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell or of their resulting inability to continue to represent him.  In disregard of Alabama law, see Ala. Rule Crim.

Compounding Munanka\xe2\x80\x99s and Ingen-Housz\xe2\x80\x99s inaction, no other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyer entered an appearance on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, moved to substitute counsel, or otherwise notified the court of any change in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 representation.

Addressing the ineffective-assistance-of-trial-counsel claims Maples stated in his federal petition, the State urged that Maples had forever forfeited those claims.  Maples did, indeed, present the claims in his state postconviction (Rule 32) petition, the State observed, but he did not timely appeal from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his petition.

Id., at 55a.  Such an argument was inadmissible, the court ruled, because this Court, in Coleman v.

Inconsistent application of the 42-days-to-appeal rule, Judge Barkett said, \xe2\x80\x9crender[ed] the rule an inadequate ground on which to bar federal review of Maples\xe2\x80\x99s claims.\xe2\x80\x9d  586 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 897.

Accordingly, we confine our consideration to the question whether Maples has shown cause to excuse the missed notice of appeal deadline.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tCause for a procedural default exists where \xe2\x80\x9csomething external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him[,] .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98impeded [his] efforts to comply with the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rule.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 753 (quoting Murray v.

That is so, we reasoned in Coleman, because the attorney is the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s agent, and under \xe2\x80\x9cwell-settled principles of agency law,\xe2\x80\x9d the principal bears the risk of negligent conduct on the part of his agent.  Id., at 753\xe2\x80\x93754.  See also Irwin v.

Having severed the principal-agent relationship, an attorney no longer acts, or fails  to act, as the client\xe2\x80\x99s representative.

Florida, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2010), is instructive.  That case involved a missed one-year deadline, prescribed by \n28 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa72244(d), for filing a federal habeas petition.  Holland presented two issues: first, whether the \xc2\xa72244(d) time limitation can be tolled for equitable reasons, and, second, whether an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s unprofessional conduct can ever count as an \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstance\xe2\x80\x9d justifying equitable tolling.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 1, 16\xe2\x80\x9317) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Id., at ___ (slip op., at 19); id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 5\xe2\x80\x936); see Lawrence v. Florida, \n\n549 U.\xc2\xa0S. 327, \n336 (2007)\n.  The Holland petitioner, however, urged that attorney negligence was not the gravamen of his complaint.  Rather, he asserted that his lawyer had detached himself from any trust relationship with his client: \xe2\x80\x9c[My lawyer] has abandoned me,\xe2\x80\x9d the petitioner complained to the court.  560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934) (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted); see Nara v.

Holland\xe2\x80\x99s plea fit the latter category: He alleged abandonment \xe2\x80\x9cevidenced by counsel\xe2\x80\x99s near-total failure to communicate with petitioner or to respond to petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s many inquiries and requests over a period of several years.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6); see id., at ___\xe2\x80\x93___, ___ (majority opinion) (slip op., at 3\xe2\x80\x934, 20).  If true, Justice Alito explained, \xe2\x80\x9cpetitioner\xe2\x80\x99s allegations would suffice to establish extraordinary circumstances beyond his control[:] Common sense dictates that a litigant cannot be held constructively responsible for the conduct of an attorney who is not operating as his agent  in any meaningful sense of that word.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 6).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F7" name="T7">\n\t\t\t\t\t7\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe agree that, under agency principles, a client cannot be charged with the acts or omissions of an attorney who has abandoned him.  Nor can a client be faulted for failing to act on his own behalf when he lacks reason to believe his attorneys of record, in fact, are not representing him.  We therefore inquire whether Maples has shown that his attorneys of record abandoned him, thereby supplying the \xe2\x80\x9cextraordinary circumstances beyond his control,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., necessary to lift the state procedural bar to his federal petition.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFrom the time he filed his initial Rule 32 petition until well after time ran out for appealing the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of that petition, Maples had only three attorneys of record: Munanka, Ingen-Housz, and Butler.  Unknown to Maples, not one of these lawyers was in fact serving as his attorney during the 42 days permitted for an appeal from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe State contends that Sullivan &amp; Cromwell represented Maples throughout his state postconviction proceedings.  Accordingly, the State urges, Maples cannot establish abandonment by counsel continuing through the six weeks allowed for noticing an appeal from the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of his Rule 32 petition.  We disagree.  It is undisputed that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples long before the default occurred.  See Brief for Respondent 47 (conceding that the two attorneys erred in failing to file motions to withdraw from the case).  Both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s employ in the summer of 2002, at least nine months before the Alabama trial court entered its order denying Rule 32 relief.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 258a.  Their new employment\xe2\x80\x94Munanka as a law clerk for a federal judge, Ingen-Housz as an employee of the European Commission in Belgium\xe2\x80\x94disabled them from continuing to represent Maples.  See Code of Conduct for Judicial Employees, Canon 4(D)(3) (1999) (prohibiting judicial employees from participating in \xe2\x80\x9clitigation against federal, state or local government\xe2\x80\x9d); Staff Regulations of Officials of the European Commission, Tit. I, Art. 12b (2004) (employees cannot perform outside work with- out first obtaining authorization from the Commission), available at http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/docs/toc100_ en.pdf (as visited Jan. 13, 2012, and in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  Hornbook agency law establishes that the attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell and their commencement of employment that prevented them from representing Maples ended their agency relationship with him.  See 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7112 (1957) (hereinafter Restatement (Second)) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he authority of an agent terminates if, without knowledge of the principal, he acquires adverse interests or if he is otherwise guilty of  a serious breach of loyalty to the principal.\xe2\x80\x9d); 2 id., \xc2\xa7394, Comment a (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he agent commits a breach of duty [of loyalty] to his principal by acting for another in an undertaking which has a substantial tendency to cause him to disregard his duty to serve his principal with only his principal\xe2\x80\x99s purposes in mind.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFurthermore, the two attorneys did not observe Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s Rule requiring them to seek the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s permission to withdraw.  See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 6.2, Comment.  Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) \xc2\xa7111, Comment b (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is ordinarily inferred that a principal does not intend an agent to do an illegal act.\xe2\x80\x9d).  By failing to seek permission to withdraw, Munanka and Ingen-Housz allowed the court\xe2\x80\x99s records to convey that they represented Maples.  As listed attorneys of record, they, not Maples, would be the addressees of court orders Alabama law requires the clerk to furnish.  See Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.5 (\xe2\x80\x9cUpon  the entry of any order in a criminal proceeding made in response to a motion, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. the clerk shall, without undue delay, furnish all parties a copy thereof by mail or by other appropriate means.\xe2\x80\x9d) and 34.4 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]here the defendant is represented by counsel, service shall be made upon the attorney of record.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough acknowledging that Munanka and Ingen-Housz severed their agency relationship with Maples upon their departure from Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, the State argues that, nonetheless, Maples was not abandoned.  Other attorneys at the firm, the State asserts, continued to serve as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 counsel.  Regarding this assertion, we note, first, that the record is cloudy on the role other Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys played.  In an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in support of Maples\xe2\x80\x99  request that the court reissue its Rule 32 order, see supra, at 9, partner Marc De Leeuw stated that he had been \xe2\x80\x9cin-volved in [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] case since the summer of 2001.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a.  After the trial court initially denied the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss in December 2001, De Leeuw informed the court, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell \xe2\x80\x9clawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared for [an anticipated] evidentiary hearing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 258a.  Another Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney, Felice Duffy, stated, in an affidavit submitted to the Alabama trial court in September 2003, that she \xe2\x80\x9cha[d] worked on [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] case since October 14, 2002.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 231.  But neither De Leeuw nor Duffy described what their \xe2\x80\x9cinvolve[ment]\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwor[k] on [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] case\xe2\x80\x9d entailed.  And neither attorney named the lawyers, other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz (both of them still with Sullivan &amp; Cromwell in December 2001), engaged in preparation for the expected hearing.  Nor did De Leeuw identify the specific work, if any, other lawyers performed on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case between Munanka\xe2\x80\x99s and Ingen-Housz\xe2\x80\x99s departures and the firm\xe2\x80\x99s receipt of the telephone call from Maples\xe2\x80\x99 mother.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F8" name="T8">\n\t\t\t\t\t8\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe slim record on activity at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, however, does not warrant a remand to determine more precisely the work done by firm lawyers other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz.  For the facts essential to our decision are not in doubt.  At the time of the default, the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorneys who later came forward\xe2\x80\x94De Leeuw, Felice Duffy, and Kathy Brewer\xe2\x80\x94had not been admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered their appearances on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, and had done nothing to inform the Alabama court that they wished to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz.  Thus, none of these attorneys had the legal authority to act on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf before his time to appeal expired.  Cf. 1 Restatement (Second) \xc2\xa7111 (The \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. terminates the agent\xe2\x80\x99s authority to act.\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F9" name="T9">\n\t\t\t\t\t9\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  What they did or did not do in their New York offices is therefore beside the point.  At the time critical to preserving Maples\xe2\x80\x99 access to an appeal, they, like Munanka and Ingen-Housz, were not Maples\xe2\x80\x99 authorized agents.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMaples\xe2\x80\x99 only other attorney of record, local counsel Butler, also left him abandoned.  Indeed, Butler did not even begin to represent Maples.  Butler informed Munanka and Ingen-Housz that he would serve as local counsel only for the purpose of enabling the two out-of-state attorneys to appear pro hac vice.  Supra, at 5\xe2\x80\x936.  Lacking the necessary \xe2\x80\x9cresources, available time [and] experience,\xe2\x80\x9d Butler told the two Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers, he would not \xe2\x80\x9cdeal with substantive issues in the case.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  That the minimal participation he undertook was inconsistent with Alabama law, see Rule VII, supra, at 5, underscores the absurdity of holding Maples barred because Butler signed on as local counsel.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn recognizing that Butler had no role in the case other than to allow Munanka and Ingen-Housz to appear pro hac vice, we need not rely solely on Butler\xe2\x80\x99s and De Leeuw\xe2\x80\x99s statements to that effect.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a\xe2\x80\x93258a.  Other factors confirm that Butler did not \xe2\x80\x9coperat[e] as [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] agent in any meaningful sense of that word.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holland, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (Alito, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (slip op., at 6).  The first is Butler\xe2\x80\x99s own conduct.  Upon receiving a copy of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s Rule 32 order, Butler did not contact Sullivan &amp; Cromwell to ensure that firm lawyers were taking appropriate action.  Although Butler had reason to believe that Munanka and Ingen-Housz had received a copy of the court\xe2\x80\x99s order, see App. 225 (indicating that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were CC\xe2\x80\x99d on the order), Butler\xe2\x80\x99s failure even to place a phone call to the New York firm substantiates his disclaimer of any genuinely representative role in the case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNotably, the State did not treat Butler as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 actual representative.  Assistant Attorney General Hayden addressed the letter informing Maples of the default directly to Maples in prison.  See supra, at 8.  Hayden sent no copy to, nor did he otherwise notify, any of the attorneys listed as counsel of record for Maples.  Lawyers in Alabama have an ethical obligation to refrain from communicating directly with an opposing party known to be represented by counsel.  See Ala. Rule of Professional Conduct 4.2 (2003); Ala. Rule Crim. Proc. 34.4 (requiring that the service of all documents \xe2\x80\x9cbe made upon the attorney of record\xe2\x80\x9d).  In writing directly and only to Maples, notwithstanding this ethical obligation, Assistant Attorney General Hayden must have believed that Maples was no longer represented by counsel, out-of-state or local.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F10" name="T10">\n\t\t\t\t\t10\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, the record admits of only one reading: At no time before the missed deadline was Butler serving as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 agent \xe2\x80\x9cin any meaningful sense of that word.\xe2\x80\x9d  Holland, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.)

In the unusual circumstances of this case, principles of agency law and fundamental fairness point to the same conclusion: There was indeed cause to excuse Maples\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default.  Through no fault of his own, Maples lacked the assistance of any authorized attorney during the 42 days Alabama allows for noticing an appeal from a trial court\xe2\x80\x99s denial of postconviction relief.  As just observed, he had no reason to suspect that, in reality, he had been reduced to pro\xc2\xa0se status.  Maples was disarmed by extraordinary circumstances quite beyond his control.

Unbeknownst to petitioner, he was effectively deprived of legal representation due to the combined effect of no fewer than eight unfortunate events: (1) the departure from their law firm of the two young lawyers who appeared as counsel of record in his state postconviction proceeding; (2) the acceptance by these two attorneys of new employment that precluded them from continuing to represent him; (3) their failure to notify petitioner of their new situation; (4) their failure to withdraw as his counsel of record; (5) the apparent failure of the firm that they left to monitor the status of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s case when these attorneys departed; (6) when notice of the decision denying petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s request for state postconviction relief was received in that firm\xe2\x80\x99s offices, the failure of the firm\xe2\x80\x99s mail room to route that important communication to either another member of the firm or to the departed attorneys\xe2\x80\x99 new addresses; (7) the failure of the clerk\xe2\x80\x99s office to take any action when the envelope containing that notice came back unopened; and (8) local counsel\xe2\x80\x99s very limited conception of the role that he was obligated to play in petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s representation.  Under these unique circumstances, I agree that petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s attorneys effectively abandoned him and that this abandonment was a \xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d that is sufficient to overcome pe-titioner\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn an effort to obtain relief for his client, petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s counsel in the case now before us cast blame for what occurred on Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s system of providing legal representation for capital defendants at trial and in state collateral proceedings.  See Brief for Petitioner 3\xe2\x80\x936.  But whatever may be said about Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s system, I do not think that Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s system had much if anything to do with petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s misfortune.  The quality of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s representation at trial obviously played no role in the failure to meet the deadline for filing his notice of appeal from the denial of his state postconviction petition.  Nor do I see any important connection between what happened in this case and Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s system for providing representation for prisoners who are sentenced to death and who wish to petition the state courts for collateral relief.  Unlike other States, Alabama relies on attorneys who volunteer to represent these prisoners pro bono, and we are told that most of these volunteers work for large, out-of-state firms.  Id., at 4.  Petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s brief states that the Alabama system had \xe2\x80\x9ca direct bearing on the events giving rise .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to the procedural default at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 3, but a similar combination of untoward events could have occurred if petitioner had been represented by Alabama attorneys who were appointed by the court and paid for with state funds.  The firm whose lawyers represented petitioner pro bono is one of the country\xe2\x80\x99s most prestigious and expensive, and I have little doubt that the vast majority of criminal defendants would think that they had won the lottery if they were given the opportunity to be represented by attorneys from such a firm.  See id., at 9 (stating that it \xe2\x80\x9cseemed as though Maples had won the lottery when two attorneys working at an elite New York law firm .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. agreed to represent Maples pro bono\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWhat occurred here was not a predictable consequence of the Alabama system but a veritable perfect storm of misfortune, a most unlikely combination of events that, without notice, effectively deprived petitioner of legal rep-resentation.

As we have long recognized, federal habeas review for state prisoners imposes significant costs on the States, undermining not only their practical interest in the finality of their criminal judgments, see Engle v. Isaac, \n\n456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 107\n\xe2\x80\x93127 (1982), but also the primacy of their courts in adjudicating the constitutional rights of defendants prosecuted under state law, id., at 128.  We have further recognized that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]hese costs are particularly high .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. when a state prisoner, through a procedural default, prevents adjudication of his constitutional claims in state court.\xe2\x80\x9d  Coleman v. Thompson, \n\n501 U.\xc2\xa0S. 722, \n748 (1991)\n.  In that situation, the prisoner has \xe2\x80\x9cdeprived the state courts of an opportunity to address those claims in the first instance,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 732, thereby leaving the state courts without \xe2\x80\x9ca chance to mend their own fences and avoid federal intrusion,\xe2\x80\x9d Engle, 456 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 129.  For that reason, and because permitting federal-court review of defaulted claims would \xe2\x80\x9cundercu[t] the State\xe2\x80\x99s ability to enforce its procedural rules,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., we have held that when a state court has relied on an adequate and independent state procedural ground in denying a prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s claims, the prisoner ordinarily may not obtain federal habeas relief.  Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 729\xe2\x80\x93730.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo be sure, the prohibition on federal-court review of defaulted claims is not absolute.  A habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s de-fault in state court will not bar federal habeas review if \xe2\x80\x9cthe petitioner demonstrates cause and actual prejudice,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 748\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9ccause\xe2\x80\x9d constituting \xe2\x80\x9csomething external to the petitioner, something that cannot fairly be attributed to him,\xe2\x80\x9d that impeded compliance with the State\xe2\x80\x99s procedural rule, id., at 753.  As a general matter, an attorney\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes (or omissions) do not meet the standard \xe2\x80\x9cbecause the attorney is the petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s agent when acting, or failing to act, in furtherance of the litigation, and the petitioner must \xe2\x80\x98bear the risk of attorney error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid. (quoting Murray v. Carrier, \n\n477 U.\xc2\xa0S. 478, \n488 (1986)\n).  See also Link v. Wabash R.

A State\xe2\x80\x99s failure in its duty to provide an effective attorney, as measured by the standard set forth in Strickland v. Washington, \n\n466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 668 (1984)\n, makes the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error chargeable to the State, and hence external to the defense.  See Murray, supra, at 488.  But when the client has no right to counsel\xe2\x80\x94as is the case in the postconviction setting, see Pennsylvania v. Finley, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 551, \n555 (1987)\n\xe2\x80\x94the client bears the risk of all attorney errors made in the course of the representation, regardless of the egregiousness of the mistake.  Coleman, supra, at 754 (\xe2\x80\x9c[I]t is not the gravity of the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s error that matters, but that it constitutes a violation of petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s right to counsel, so that the error must be seen as an external factor\xe2\x80\x9d).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the principles just set out, the Court is correct to conclude, ante, at 14, that a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default may be excused when it is attributable to abandonment by his attorney.  In such a case, Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for attributing the attorney\xe2\x80\x99s acts and omissions to the client breaks down; for once the attorney has ceased acting as the client\xe2\x80\x99s agent, \xe2\x80\x9cwell-settled principles of agency law,\xe2\x80\x9d  501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 754, no longer support charging the client with his lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes.  The attorney\xe2\x80\x99s mistakes may therefore be understood as an \xe2\x80\x9cexternal factor,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., and in appropriate circumstances may jus-tify excusing the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI likewise agree with the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion, ante, at 15, that Maples\xe2\x80\x99 two out-of-state attorneys of record, Jaasi Munanka and Clara Ingen-Housz, had abandoned Maples by the time the Alabama trial court entered its order denying his petition for postconviction relief.  As the Court observes, ante, at 15\xe2\x80\x9316, without informing Maples or seeking leave from the Alabama trial court to withdraw from Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case, both Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s employ and accepted new positions that precluded them from continuing to represent Maples.  This conduct amounted to renunciation of their roles as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 agents, see 1 Restatement (Second) of Agency \xc2\xa7119, Comment b (1957) (hereinafter Restatement 2d), and thus terminated their authority to act on Maples\xe2\x80\x99 behalf, id., \xc2\xa7118.  As a result, Munanka\xe2\x80\x99s and Ingen-Housz\xe2\x80\x99s failure to take action in response to the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order should not be imputed to Maples.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is an unjustified leap, however, to conclude that Maples was left unrepresented during the relevant window between the Alabama trial court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal of his postconviction petition and expiration of the 42-day period for filing a notice of appeal established by Alabama Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(1) (2009).  Start with Maples\xe2\x80\x99 own allegations: In his amended federal habeas petition, Maples alleged that, at the time he sought postconvic- tion relief in Alabama trial court, he \xe2\x80\x9cwas represented by Sullivan &amp; Cromwell of New York, New York.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 256.  Although the petition went on to identify Munanka and Ingen-Housz as \xe2\x80\x9cthe two Sullivan lawyers handling the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 257, its statement that Maples was \xe2\x80\x9crepresented\xe2\x80\x9d by the firm itself strongly suggests that Maples viewed himself as having retained the services of the firm as a whole, a perfectly natural understanding.  \xe2\x80\x9cWhen a client retains a lawyer who practices with a firm, the presumption is that both the lawyer and the firm have been retained.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers \xc2\xa731, Comment f, p. 222 (1998).  Admittedly, in connection with the attempt before the Alabama trial court to extend the time for appeal, Sullivan &amp; Cromwell partner Marc De Leeuw submitted an affidavit stating that the firm\xe2\x80\x99s lawyers \xe2\x80\x9chandle pro\xc2\xa0bono cases on an individual basis\xe2\x80\x9d and that the lawyers who had appeared in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case had followed that practice, \xe2\x80\x9cattempt[ing] not to use the firm name on correspondence or court papers.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 257a.  But Maples\xe2\x80\x99 habeas petition is the pleading that initiated the current litigation; and surely the allegations that it contained should be given priority over representations made to prior courts.*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn any case, even if Maples had no attorney-client relationship with the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell firm, Munanka and Ingen-Housz were surely not the only Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers who represented Maples on an individual basis.  De Leeuw\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit acknowledged that he had \xe2\x80\x9cbeen involved in [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] case since the summer of 2001,\xe2\x80\x9d ibid., roughly a year before Munanka and Ingen-Housz left Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, and it further stated that after \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka\xe2\x80\x9d learned of the court\xe2\x80\x99s initial order denying the State\xe2\x80\x99s motion to dismiss Maples\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction petition in December 2001, \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawyers working on this case for Mr. Maples prepared for the evidentiary hearing\xe2\x80\x9d Maples had requested, id., at 258a.  Moreover, when Sullivan &amp; Cromwell attorney Felice Duffy filed a motion to appear pro hac vice before the Alabama trial court in connection with the attempt to extend the deadline, she stated that she had \xe2\x80\x9cworked on [Maples\xe2\x80\x99] case since October 14, 2002,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 231, months before the procedural default took place.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAccording to the Court, see ante, at 17, De Leeuw\xe2\x80\x99s affidavit does not make clear how he was \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 case or whether lawyers other than Munanka and Ingen-Housz were among those who prepared for the anticipated evidentiary hearing; and Duffy\xe2\x80\x99s motion does not make clear what her \xe2\x80\x9cwor[k]\xe2\x80\x9d entailed.  But there is little doubt that Munanka and Ingen-Housz were not the only attorneys who engaged in the preparations; and that De Leeuw was \xe2\x80\x9cinvolved\xe2\x80\x9d and Duffy \xe2\x80\x9cworked\xe2\x80\x9d as lawyers for Maples (what other role could they have taken on?).  De Leeuw\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between \xe2\x80\x9cMs. Ingen-Housz and Mr. Munanka\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe lawyers working on his case for Mr. Maples\xe2\x80\x9d would have been senseless if the latter category did not extend beyond the two named attorneys.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, there is every indication that when the trial court entered its order dismissing Maples\xe2\x80\x99 postconviction petition in May 2003, Maples continued to be represented by a team of attorneys in Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s New York office.  The Court nonetheless insists that the actions of these attorneys are irrelevant because they had not been admitted to practice law in Alabama, had not entered appearances in the Alabama trial court, and had not sought to substitute for Munanka and Ingen-Housz.  See ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  The Court does not, however, explain why these facts establish that the attorneys were not Maples\xe2\x80\x99 agents for the purpose of attending to those aspects of the case that did not require court appearance\xe2\x80\x94which would certainly include keeping track of orders issued and filing deadlines.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s quotation from the Restatement of Agency, ante, at 18, that the \xe2\x80\x9cfailure to acquire a qualification by the agent without which it is illegal to do an authorized act .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. terminates the agent\xe2\x80\x99s authority to act,\xe2\x80\x9d 1 Restatement 2d, \xc2\xa7111, at 290, omits the crucial condition contained at the end of the section: \xe2\x80\x9cif thereafter he [the agent] should infer that the principal, if he knew the facts, would not consent to the further exercise of the authority.\xe2\x80\x9d  There was no basis whatever for these attorneys to infer that Maples no longer wanted them to represent him, simply because they had not yet qualified before the Alabama court.  Though it would have been \xe2\x80\x9cillegal\xe2\x80\x9d for these attorneys to file a notice of appeal without being authorized to practice in Alabama, nothing prevented them from first seeking to secure admission to practice, as Munanka and Ingen-Housz initially had done, and then filing a notice of appeal.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt would create a huge gap in our Coleman jurisprudence to disregard all attorney errors committed before admission to the relevant court; and an even greater gap to disregard (as the Court suggests) all errors committed before the attorney enters an appearance.  Moreover, even if these attorneys cannot be regarded as Maples\xe2\x80\x99 agents for purposes of conducting the Alabama litigation, they were at least his agents for purposes of advising him of the impending deadline.  His unawareness was the fault of counsel who were his agents, and must be charged to him.  What happened here is simply \xe2\x80\x9c[a]ttorney ignorance or inadvertence\xe2\x80\x9d of the sort that does not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default.  Coleman, 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 753.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut even leaving aside the question of Maples\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cunadmitted\xe2\x80\x9d attorneys at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, Maples had a fully admitted attorney, who had entered an appearance, in the person of local counsel, John Butler.  There is no support for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that Butler \xe2\x80\x9cdid not even begin to represent Maples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.  True, the affidavit Butler filed with the Alabama trial court in the proceeding seeking extension of the deadline stated that he had \xe2\x80\x9cno substantive involvement\xe2\x80\x9d with the case, and that he had \xe2\x80\x9cagreed to serve as local counsel only.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. to Pet. for Cert. 255a.  But a disclaimer of \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive involvement\xe2\x80\x9d in a case, whether or not it violates a lawyer\xe2\x80\x99s ethical obligations, see ante, at 19, is not equivalent to a denial of any agency role at all.  A local attorney\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cnonsubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d involvement would surely include, at a minimum, keeping track of local court orders and advising \xe2\x80\x9csubstantive\xe2\x80\x9d counsel of impending deadlines.  Nor did Butler\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for his failure to act when he received a copy of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order sound in abandonment.  Butler did not say, for instance, that he ignored the order because he did not consider Maples to be his client.  Instead, based on \xe2\x80\x9cpast practice\xe2\x80\x9d and the content of the order, Butler \xe2\x80\x9cassumed\xe2\x80\x9d that Maples\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell would receive a copy.  App. to Pet. for Cert. 256a.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court gets this badly wrong when it states that \xe2\x80\x9cButler\xe2\x80\x99s failure even to place a phone call to the New York firm\xe2\x80\x9d demonstrates Butler\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cdisclaimer of any genuinely representative role.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 19.  By equating the very attorney error that contributed to Maples\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default with the absence of an agency relationship, the Court ensures that today\xe2\x80\x99s opinion will serve as a template for future habeas petitioners seeking to evade Coleman\xe2\x80\x99s holding that ineffectiveness of postconviction counsel will not furnish cause to excuse a procedural default.  See 501 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 752\xe2\x80\x93754.  The trick will be to allege, not that counsel was ineffective, but rather that counsel\xe2\x80\x99s ineffectiveness demonstrates that he was not a genuinely representative agent.  No precedent should be so easily circumvented by word games, but the damage is particularly acute when the affected precedent is so firmly \xe2\x80\x9cgrounded in concerns of comity and federalism.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 730.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court\xe2\x80\x99s last-gasp attempt to justify its conclusion that Butler was not Maples\xe2\x80\x99 agent is to point out that a prosecutor sent a letter to Maples directly, informing him of the defaulted appeal.  See ante, at 20.  The Court reasons that the prosecutor must have thought that Maples had been abandoned by his lawyers, since to communicate with a represented party would have been a violation of ethical standards.  Ibid.  But even if this supposition is correct, it is hard to understand what it proves.  What matters, after all, is not whether the prosecutor thought Maples had been abandoned, but whether Maples really was abandoned.  And as it turns out, Butler\xe2\x80\x99s conduct after learning about the default further belies any such contention.  Almost immediately, Butler began to cooperate with Maples\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell, filing papers as \xe2\x80\x9cCounsel for Mr. Maples\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cLocal Counsel for Petitioner Cory Maples\xe2\x80\x9d in multiple courts in an attempt to rectify the mistake.  See App. 229, 230, 236, 238.  Had Butler reassumed his representational duties after having abandoned them?  Hardly.  There is no proper basis for a conclusion of abandonment interruptus.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMaples argues in the alternative that his default should be excused because his right to due process was violated when the trial-court clerk failed to take action after Munanka\xe2\x80\x99s and Ingen-Housz\xe2\x80\x99s copies of the court\xe2\x80\x99s dismissal order were returned undeliverable.  According to Maples, our decision in Jones v. Flowers, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 220 (2006)\n, establishes that the clerk had a duty to do more.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tWe held in Jones that, when a mailed notice of a tax sale is returned unclaimed, a State must take additional reasonable steps to attempt to provide notice to the property owner before selling his property.  See id., at 234.  It is questionable whether that holding has any relevance to the circumstances here, which involved not the institution of proceedings against an unwitting litigant, but rather the issuance of an order in a pending case that was instituted by Maples himself.  Indeed, I think it doubtful whether due process entitles a litigant to any notice of a court\xe2\x80\x99s order in a pending case.  The Federal Rules certainly reject the notion that notice is an absolute requirement.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 77(d)(2) provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[l]ack of notice of the entry [of an order or judgment] does not affect the time for appeal or relieve\xe2\x80\x94or authorize the court to relieve\xe2\x80\x94a party for failing to appeal within the time allowed, except as allowed by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure (4)(a).\xe2\x80\x9d  And although Federal Rule of Appellate Rule 4(a)(6) in turn provides that the time for filing an appeal can be reopened when a litigant did not receive notice, it establishes 180 days after the judgment or order is entered as the outer limit by which a motion to reopen must be filed.  See Fed. Rule App. Proc. 4(a)(6)(B).  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThere is no need to grapple with this question, however, because Butler received a copy of the trial court\xe2\x80\x99s order.  \xe2\x80\x9cUnder our system of representative litigation, \xe2\x80\x98each party .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is considered to have notice of all facts, notice of which can be charged upon [his] attorney.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, \n\n498 U.\xc2\xa0S. 89, \n92 (1990)\n (quoting Link v. Wabash R. Co., \n\n370 U.\xc2\xa0S. 626, \n634 (1962)\n).  The notice to Butler was therefore constitutionally sufficient.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tOne suspects that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision is motivated in large part by an understandable sense of frustration with the State\xe2\x80\x99s refusal to waive Maples\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default in the interest of fairness.  Indeed, that frustration may well explain the Court\xe2\x80\x99s lengthy indictment of Alabama\xe2\x80\x99s general procedures for providing representation to capital defendants, ante, at 2\xe2\x80\x934, a portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that is so disconnected from the rest of its analysis as to be otherwise inexplicable.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut if the interest of fairness justifies our excusing Maples\xe2\x80\x99 procedural default here, it does so whenever a defendant\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default is caused by his attorney.  That is simply not the law\xe2\x80\x94and cannot be, if the states are to have an orderly system of criminal litigation conducted by counsel.  Our precedents allow a State to stand on its rights and enforce a habeas petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s procedural default even when counsel is to blame.  Because a faithful application of those precedents leads to the conclusion that Maples has not demonstrated cause to excuse his procedural default; and because the reasoning by which the Court justifies the opposite conclusion invites future evisceration of the principle that defendants are responsible for the mistakes of their attorneys; I respectfully dissent.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t*\xc2\xa0The Court says that the allegations in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 own habeas petition are not \xe2\x80\x9cpersuasive evidence,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 17\xe2\x80\x9318, n.\xc2\xa08, because Maples\xe2\x80\x99 lawyers at Sullivan &amp; Cromwell labored under a conflict of interest when they prepared the document.   This is a curious point, since the effect of Maples\xe2\x80\x99 statement was to implicate Sullivan &amp; Cromwell as a firm in missing the filing deadline.  The conflict would have induced the Sullivan &amp; Cromwell lawyers to exonerate the firm.  To be sure, as the case later developed (at this stage abandonment had not yet been conceived as the litigating strategy), it would have been in Maples\xe2\x80\x99 interest to say he had no lawyers.  But the issue the petition\xe2\x80\x99s statement raises is not whether Maples was cleverly represented; it is whether the statement was true.  And if Sullivan &amp; Cromwell\xe2\x80\x99s involvement in preparing the petition has any bearing upon that, it only reinforces the truth.\n\t</span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
