S. 483</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. JUSTICE NELSON delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>A motion has been made, on the part of the appellee, to dismiss the appeal, for the want of jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>A libel was filed by Clifton in the district court to recover freight on the two hundred and sixty-nine bales of cotton and nine bags of wool.  Brower and Sheldon appeared as claimants and contested the claim for the freight.  Brower claimed sixty-seven of the two hundred and sixty-nine bales, and Sheldon two hundred and two bales.  The district court dismissed the libel.</p>\n<p>On appeal to the circuit court, this decree was reversed and decree rendered in favor of the libellant for the amount of the freight, $2,338.06; that J. W. Brower, claimant of a portion of the cotton, pay to the libellant the sum of $583.84, being the freight on the cotton claimed by him in the suit, and that the </p><p><a class="page-number" name="484">Page 64 U. S. 484</a></p><p> claimant, W. H. Sheldon, pay for the portion claimed by him the sum of $1,754.22.  Sheldon appealed from the decree to this Court.</p>\n<p>The motion is now made to dismiss the appeal on the ground that the decree against Sheldon is less than $2,000, and which is apparent from a perusal of the decree.  The sum decreed against him is only $1,754.22.</p>\n<p>The freight was separately awarded against the claimants, in proportion to the cotton shipped by each one.  The rights of each were distinct and independent.</p>\n<p>But if it were otherwise, and the whole of the freight jointly against the claimants, the appeal must still be dismissed, as then the claimants should have joined in it.</p>\n<p><em>Motion to dismiss granted.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
