The swab was matched to an unsolved 2003 rape, and King was charged with that crime.  He moved to suppress the DNA match, arguing that the Act violated the \n \nFourth Amendment, but the Circuit Court Judge found the law constitutional.  King was convicted of rape.  The Maryland Court of Appeals set aside the conviction, finding unconstitutional the portions of the Act authorizing DNA collection from felony arrestees.  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E">\n\t\t\t\tHeld:\xc2\xa0When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the \n \nFourth Amendment.

Osborne, \n\n557 U.\xc2\xa0S. 52\n, by making it \xe2\x80\x9cpossible to determine whether a biological tissue matches a suspect with near certainty,\xe2\x80\x9d id., at 62.  Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s Act authorizes law enforcement authorities to collect DNA samples from, as relevant here, persons charged with violent crimes, including first-degree assault.  A sample may not be added to a database before an individual is arraigned, and it must be destroyed if, e.g., he is not convicted.  Only identity information may be added to the database.  Here, the officer collected a DNA sample using the common \xe2\x80\x9cbuccal swab\xe2\x80\x9d procedure, which is quick and painless, requires no \xe2\x80\x9csurgical intrusio[n] beneath the skin,\xe2\x80\x9d Winston v.

Respondent\xe2\x80\x99s identification as the rapist resulted in part through the operation of the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS), which connects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national level, and which standardizes the points of comparison, i.e., loci, used in DNA analysis.

Using a buccal swab inside a person\xe2\x80\x99s cheek to obtain a DNA sample is a search under the \n \nFourth Amendment.  And the fact that the intrusion is negligible is of central relevance to determining whether the search is reasonable, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search,\xe2\x80\x9d Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646\n.  Because the need for a warrant is greatly diminished here, where the arrestee was already in valid police custody for a serious offense supported by probable cause, the search is analyzed by reference to \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness, not individualized suspicion,\xe2\x80\x9d Samson v. California, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 843\n, n.\xc2\xa04, and reasonableness is determined by weighing \xe2\x80\x9cthe promotion of legitimate governmental interests\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9cthe degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d Wyoming v.

Pugh, \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n\xe2\x80\x93114; and the \xe2\x80\x9cvalidity of the search of a person incident to a lawful arrest\xe2\x80\x9d is settled, United States v. Robinson, \n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218\n.  Individual suspicion is not necessary.  The \xe2\x80\x9croutine administrative procedure[s] at a police station house incident to booking and jailing the suspect\xe2\x80\x9d have different origins and different constitutional justifications than, say, the search of a place not incident to arrest, Illinois v. Lafayette, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 640\n, which depends on the \xe2\x80\x9cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place,\xe2\x80\x9d Illinois v. Gates, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213\n.  And when probable cause exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society and hold him in legal custody, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.  First, the government has an interest in properly identifying \xe2\x80\x9cwho has been arrested and who is being tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177\n.  Criminal history is critical to officers who are processing a suspect for detention.  They already seek identity information through routine and accepted means: comparing booking photographs to sketch artists\xe2\x80\x99 depictions, showing mugshots to potential witnesses, and comparing fingerprints against electronic databases of known criminals and unsolved crimes.  The only difference between DNA analysis and fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy DNA provides.  DNA is another metric of identification used to connect the arrestee with his or her public persona, as reflected in records of his or her actions that are available to the police.  Second, officers must ensure that the custody of an arrestee does not create inordinate \xe2\x80\x9crisks for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  DNA allows officers to know the type of person being detained.  Third, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has a substantial interest in ensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bell v. Wolfish, \n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520\n.  An arrestee may be more inclined to flee if he thinks that continued contact with the criminal justice system may expose another serious offense.  Fourth, an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct is essential to assessing the danger he poses to the public, which will inform a court\xe2\x80\x99s bail determination.  Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a previous violent crime based on DNA identification may be especially probative in this regard.  Finally, in the interests of justice, identifying an arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned.  Pp.\xc2\xa010\xe2\x80\x9318.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t(2)\xc2\xa0DNA identification is an important advance in the techniques long used by law enforcement to serve legitimate police concerns.  Police routinely have used scientific advancements as standard procedures for identifying arrestees.  Fingerprinting, perhaps the most direct historical analogue to DNA technology, has, from its advent, been viewed as a natural part of \xe2\x80\x9cthe administrative steps incident to arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  County of Riverside v. McLaughlin, \n\n500 U.\xc2\xa0S. 44\n.  However, DNA identification is far superior.  The additional intrusion upon the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy beyond that associated with fingerprinting is not significant, and DNA identification is markedly more accurate.  It may not be as fast as fingerprinting, but rapid fingerprint analysis is itself of recent vintage, and the question of how long it takes to process identifying information goes to the efficacy of the search for its purpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality of the search.  Rapid technical advances are also reducing DNA processing times.

Reasonableness must be considered in the context of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate privacy expectations, which necessarily diminish when he is taken into police custody.  Bell, supra, at 557.  Such searches thus differ from the so-called special needs searches of, e.g., otherwise law-abiding motorists at checkpoints.  See Indianapolis v. Edmond, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32\n.  The reasonableness inquiry considers two other circumstances in which particularized suspicion is not categorically required: \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished expectations of privacy [and a] minimal intrusion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Illinois v. McArthur, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326\n.  An invasive surgery may raise privacy concerns weighty enough for the search to require a warrant, notwithstanding the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s diminished privacy expectations, but a buccal swab, which involves a brief and minimal intrusion with \xe2\x80\x9cvirtually no risk, trauma, or pain,\xe2\x80\x9d Schmerber v. California, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 757\n, does not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of arrest.

Those loci came from noncoding DNA parts that do not reveal an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s genetic traits and are unlikely to reveal any private medical information.  Even if they could provide such information, they are not in fact tested for that end.  Finally, the Act provides statutory protections to guard against such invasions of privacy.

As part of a routine booking procedure for serious offenses, his DNA sample was taken by applying a cotton swab or filter paper\xe2\x80\x94known as a buccal swab\xe2\x80\x94to the inside of his cheeks.  The DNA was found to match the DNA taken from the Salisbury rape victim.  King was tried and convicted for the rape.  Additional DNA samples were taken from him and used in the rape trial, but there seems to be no doubt that it was the DNA from the cheek sample taken at the time he was booked in 2009 that led to his first having been linked to the rape and charged with its commission.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court of Appeals of Maryland, on review of King\xe2\x80\x99s rape conviction, ruled that the DNA taken when King was booked for the 2009 charge was an unlawful seizure because obtaining and using the cheek swab was an unreasonable search of the person.

Once the DNA was matched to King, detectives presented the forensic evidence to a grand jury, which indicted him for the rape.  Detectives obtained a search warrant and took a second sample of DNA from King, which again matched the evidence from the rape.  He moved to suppress the DNA match on the grounds that Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s DNA collection law violated the \n \nFourth Amendment.  The Circuit Court Judge upheld the statute as constitutional.  King pleaded not guilty to the rape charges but was convicted and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn a divided opinion, the Maryland Court of Appeals struck down the portions of the Act authorizing collection of DNA from felony arrestees as unconstitutional.

In reach- ing that conclusion the Maryland Court relied on the deci-sions of various other courts that have concluded that DNA identification of arrestees is impermissible.  See, e.g., People v.

Authorized by Congress and supervised by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS) connects DNA laboratories at the local, state, and national level.  Since its authorization in 1994, the CODIS system has grown to include all 50 States and a number of federal agencies.  CODIS collects DNA profiles provided by local laboratories taken from arrestees, convicted offenders, and forensic evidence found at crime scenes.  To participate in CODIS, a local laboratory must sign a memorandum of understanding agreeing to adhere to quality standards and submit to audits to evaluate compliance with the federal standards for scientifically rigorous DNA testing.

The CODIS database is based on 13 loci at which the STR alleles are noted and compared.  These loci make possible extreme accuracy in matching individual samples, with a \xe2\x80\x9crandom match probability of approximately 1 in 100 trillion (assuming unrelated individuals).\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  The CODIS loci are from the non-protein coding junk regions of DNA, and \xe2\x80\x9care not known to have any association with a genetic disease or any other genetic predisposition.  Thus, the information in the database is only useful for human identity testing.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 279.  STR information is recorded only as a \xe2\x80\x9cstring of numbers\xe2\x80\x9d; and the DNA identification is accompanied only by information denoting the laboratory and the analyst responsible for the submission.  Id., at 270.  In short, CODIS sets uniform national standards for DNA matching and then facilitates connections between local law enforcement agencies who can share more specific information about matched STR profiles.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAll 50 States require the collection of DNA from felony convicts, and respondent does not dispute the validity of that practice.  See Brief for Respondent 48.  Twenty-eight States and the Federal Government have adopted laws similar to the Maryland Act authorizing the collection of DNA from some or all arrestees.  See Brief for State of California et\xc2\xa0al. as Amici Curiae 4, n.\xc2\xa01 (States Brief) (collecting state statutes).  Although those statutes vary in their particulars, such as what charges require a DNA sample, their similarity means that this case implicates more than the specific Maryland law.  At issue is a standard, expanding technology already in widespread use throughout the Nation.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAlthough the DNA swab procedure used here presents a question the Court has not yet addressed, the framework for deciding the issue is well established.  The \n \nFourth Amendment, binding on the States by the \n \nFourteenth Amendment, provides that \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  It can be agreed that using a buccal swab on the inner tissues of a person\xe2\x80\x99s cheek in order to obtain DNA samples is a search.  Virtually any \xe2\x80\x9cintrusio[n] into the human body,\xe2\x80\x9d Schmerber v. California, \n\n384 U.\xc2\xa0S. 757, \n770 (1966)\n, will work an invasion of \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98cherished personal security\xe2\x80\x99 that is subject to constitutional scrutiny,\xe2\x80\x9d Cupp v.

The Court has applied the \n \nFourth Amendment to police efforts to draw blood, see Schmerber, supra; Missouri v. McNeely, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2013), scraping an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s fingernails to obtain trace evidence, see Cupp, supra, and even to \xe2\x80\x9ca breathalyzer test, which generally requires the production of alveolar or \xe2\x80\x98deep lung\xe2\x80\x99 breath for chemical analysis,\xe2\x80\x9d  Skinner v.

It involves but a light touch on the inside of the cheek; and although it can be deemed a search within the body of the arrestee, it requires no \xe2\x80\x9csurgical intrusions beneath the skin.\xe2\x80\x9d  Winston, 470 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 760.  The fact than an intrusion is negligible is of central relevance to determining reasonableness, although it is still a search as the law defines that term.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tTo say that the \n \nFourth Amendment applies here is the beginning point, not the end of the analysis.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s proper function is to constrain, not against all intrusions as such, but against intrusions which are not justified in the circumstances, or which are made in an improper manner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schmerber, supra, at 768.  \xe2\x80\x9cAs the text of the \n \nFourth Amendment indicates, the ultimate measure of the constitutionality of a governmental search is \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Vernonia School Dist. 47J v. Acton, \n\n515 U.\xc2\xa0S. 646, \n652 (1995)\n.  In giving content to the inquiry whether an intrusion is reasonable, the Court has preferred \xe2\x80\x9csome quantum of individualized suspicion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [as] a prerequisite to a constitutional search or seizure.  But the \n \nFourth Amendment imposes no irreducible requirement of such suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Martinez-Fuerte, \n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 543\n\xe2\x80\x93561 (1976) (citation and footnote omitted).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn some circumstances, such as \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hen faced with special law enforcement needs, diminished expectations of privacy, minimal intrusions, or the like, the Court has found that certain general, or individual, circumstances may render a warrantless search or seizure reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  Illinois v. McArthur, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 326, \n330 (2001)\n.  Those circumstances diminish the need for a warrant, either because \xe2\x80\x9cthe public interest is such that neither a warrant nor probable cause is required,\xe2\x80\x9d Maryland v. Buie, \n\n494 U.\xc2\xa0S. 325, \n331 (1990)\n, or because an individual is already on notice, for instance because of his employment, see Skinner, supra, or the conditions of his release from government custody, see Samson v. California, \n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 843 (2006)\n, that some reasonable police intrusion on his pri-vacy is to be expected.  The need for a warrant is perhaps least when the search involves no discretion that could properly be limited by the \xe2\x80\x9cinterpo[lation of] a neutral magistrate between the citizen and the law enforcement officer.\xe2\x80\x9d  Treasury Employees v. Von Raab, \n\n489 U.\xc2\xa0S. 656, \n667 (1989)\n.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe instant case can be addressed with this background.  The Maryland DNA Collection Act provides that, in order to obtain a DNA sample, all arrestees charged with serious crimes must furnish the sample on a buccal swab applied, as noted, to the inside of the cheeks.  The arrestee is already in valid police custody for a serious offense supported by probable cause.  The DNA collection is not subject to the judgment of officers whose perspective might be \xe2\x80\x9ccolored by their primary involvement in \xe2\x80\x98the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  Terry, supra, at 12 (quoting Johnson v. United States, \n\n333 U.\xc2\xa0S. 10, \n14 (1948)\n).  As noted by this Court in a different but still instructive context involving blood testing, \xe2\x80\x9c[b]oth the circumstances justifying toxicological testing and the permissible limits of such intrusions are defined nar- rowly and specifically in the regulations that authorize them\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.  Indeed, in light of the standardized nature of the tests and the minimal discretion vested in those charged with administering the program, there are virtually no facts for a neutral magistrate to evaluate.\xe2\x80\x9d  Skinner, supra, at 622.  Here, the search effected by the buccal swab of respondent falls within the category of cases this Court has analyzed by reference to the proposition that the \xe2\x80\x9ctouchstone of the \n \nFourth Amendment is reasonableness, not individualized suspicion.\xe2\x80\x9d  Samson, supra, at 855, n.\xc2\xa04.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if a warrant is not required, a search is not beyond \n \nFourth Amendment scrutiny; for it must be reasonable in its scope and manner of execution.  Urgent government interests are not a license for indiscriminate police behavior.  To say that no warrant is required is merely to acknowledge that \xe2\x80\x9crather than employing a per se rule of unreasonableness, we balance the privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  McArthur, supra, at 331.  This application of \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional standards of reasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d requires a court to weigh \xe2\x80\x9cthe promotion of legitimate governmen- tal interests\xe2\x80\x9d against \xe2\x80\x9cthe degree to which [the search] intrudes upon an individual\xe2\x80\x99s privacy.\xe2\x80\x9d  Wyoming v. Houghton, \n\n526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 295, \n300 (1999)\n.  An assessment of reasonableness to determine the lawfulness of requiring this class of arrestees to provide a DNA sample is central to the instant case.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tIV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe legitimate government interest served by the Maryland DNA Collection Act is one that is well established: the need for law enforcement officers in a safe and accurate way to process and identify the persons and possessions they must take into custody.  It is beyond dispute that \xe2\x80\x9cprobable cause provides legal justification for arresting a person suspected of crime, and for a brief period of detention to take the administrative steps incident to arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Gerstein v. Pugh, \n\n420 U.\xc2\xa0S. 103\n\xe2\x80\x93114 (1975).  Also uncontested is the \xe2\x80\x9cright on the part of the Government, always recognized under English and American law, to search the person of the accused when legally arrested.\xe2\x80\x9d  Weeks v. United States, \n\n232 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383, \n392 (1914)\n, overruled on other grounds, Mapp v. Ohio, \n\n367 U.\xc2\xa0S. 643 (1961)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe validity of the search of a person incident to a lawful arrest has been regarded as settled from its first enunciation, and has remained virtually unchallenged.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Robinson, \n\n414 U.\xc2\xa0S. 218, \n224 (1973)\n.  Even in that context, the Court has been clear that individual suspicion is not necessary, because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he constitutionality of a search incident to an arrest does not depend on whether there is any indication that the person ar-rested possesses weapons or evidence.  The fact of a lawful arrest, standing alone, authorizes a search.\xe2\x80\x9d  Michigan v.

Lafayette, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 640, \n643 (1983)\n; for the search of a place not incident to an arrest depends on the \xe2\x80\x9cfair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place,\xe2\x80\x9d  Illinois v. Gates, \n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 213, \n238 (1983)\n.  The interests are further different when an individual is formally processed into police custody.  Then \xe2\x80\x9cthe law is in the act of subjecting the body of the accused to its physical dominion.\xe2\x80\x9d  People v. Chiagles, 237 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 193, 197, 142 N.\xc2\xa0E. 583, 584 (1923) (Cardozo, J.).  When probable cause exists to remove an individual from the normal channels of society and hold him in legal custody, DNA identification plays a critical role in serving those interests.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, \xe2\x80\x9c[i]n every criminal case, it is known and must be known who has been arrested and who is being tried.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nev., Humboldt Cty., \n\n542 U.\xc2\xa0S. 177, \n191 (2004)\n.  An individual\xe2\x80\x99s identity is more than just his name or Social Security number, and the government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in identification goes beyond ensuring that the proper name is typed on the indictment.  Identity has never been considered limited to the name on the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s birth certificate.  In fact, a name is of little value compared to the real interest in identification at stake when an individual is brought into custody.  \xe2\x80\x9cIt is a well recognized aspect of criminal conduct that the per-petrator will take unusual steps to conceal not only his conduct, but also his identity.  Disguises used while committing a crime may be supplemented or replaced by changed names, and even changed physical features.\xe2\x80\x9d  Jones v. Murray, 962 F.\xc2\xa02d 302, 307 (CA4 1992).

It is a common occurrence that \xe2\x80\x9c[p]eople detained for minor offenses can turn out to be the most devious and dangerous criminals.  Hours after the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh was stopped by a state trooper who noticed he was driving without a license plate.  Police stopped serial killer Joel Rifkin for the same reason.  One of the terrorists involved in the September 11 attacks was stopped and ticketed for speeding just two days before hijacking Flight 93.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14) (citations omitted).  Police already seek this crucial identifying information.  They use routine and accepted means as varied as comparing the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s booking photograph to sketch artists\xe2\x80\x99 depictions of persons of interest, showing his mugshot to potential witnesses, and of course making a computerized comparison of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints against electronic databases of known criminals and unsolved crimes.  In this respect the only difference between DNA analysis and the accepted use of fingerprint databases is the unparalleled accuracy DNA provides.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe task of identification necessarily entails searching public and police records based on the identifying information provided by the arrestee to see what is already known about him.  The DNA collected from arrestees is an irrefutable identification of the person from whom it was taken.  Like a fingerprint, the 13 CODIS loci are not themselves evidence of any particular crime, in the way that a drug test can by itself be evidence of illegal narcotics use.  A DNA profile is useful to the police because it gives them a form of identification to search the records already in their valid possession.  In this respect the use of DNA for identification is no different than matching an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s face to a wanted poster of a previously unidentified suspect; or matching tattoos to known gang symbols to reveal a criminal affiliation; or matching the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints to those recovered from a crime scene.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 19.  DNA is another metric of identification used to connect the arrestee with his or her public persona, as reflected in records of his or her actions that are available to the police.  Those records may be linked to the arrestee by a variety of relevant forms of identification, including name, alias, date and time of previous convictions and the name then used, photograph, Social Security number, or CODIS profile.  These data, found in official records, are checked as a routine matter to produce a more comprehensive record of the suspect\xe2\x80\x99s complete identity.  Finding occurrences of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s CODIS profile in outstanding cases is consistent with this common practice.  It uses a different form of identification than a name or fingerprint, but its function is the same.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSecond, law enforcement officers bear a responsibility for ensuring that the custody of an arrestee does not create inordinate \xe2\x80\x9crisks for facility staff, for the existing detainee population, and for a new detainee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florence, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 10).  DNA identification can provide untainted information to those charged with de-taining suspects and detaining the property of any felon.  For these purposes officers must know the type of person whom they are detaining, and DNA allows them to make critical choices about how to proceed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cKnowledge of identity may inform an officer that a suspect is wanted for another offense, or has a record of violence or mental disorder.  On the other hand, knowing identity may help clear a suspect and al- low the police to concentrate their efforts elsewhere.  Identity may prove particularly important in [certain cases, such as] where the police are investigating what appears to be a domestic assault.  Officers called to investigate domestic disputes need to know whom they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hiibel, supra, at 186.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tRecognizing that a name alone cannot address this interest in identity, the Court has approved, for example, \xe2\x80\x9ca visual inspection for certain tattoos and other signs of gang affiliation as part of the intake process,\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he identification and isolation of gang members before they are admitted protects everyone.\xe2\x80\x9d  Florence, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 11).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThird, looking forward to future stages of criminal prosecution, \xe2\x80\x9cthe Government has a substantial interest in ensuring that persons accused of crimes are available for trials.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bell v. Wolfish, \n\n441 U.\xc2\xa0S. 520, \n534 (1979)\n.  A person who is arrested for one offense but knows that he has yet to answer for some past crime may be more inclined to flee the instant charges, lest continued contact with the criminal justice system expose one or more other serious offenses.  For example, a defendant who had committed a prior sexual assault might be inclined to flee on a burglary charge, knowing that in every State a DNA sample would be taken from him after his conviction on the burglary charge that would tie him to the more serious charge of rape.  In addition to subverting the administration of justice with respect to the crime of arrest, this ties back to the interest in safety; for a detainee who absconds from custody presents a risk to law enforcement officers, other detainees, victims of previous crimes, witnesses, and society at large.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFourth, an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct is essential to an assessment of the danger he poses to the public, and this will inform a court\xe2\x80\x99s determination whether the individual should be released on bail.  \xe2\x80\x9cThe government\xe2\x80\x99s interest in preventing crime by arrestees is both legitimate and compelling.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Salerno, \n\n481 U.\xc2\xa0S. 739, \n749 (1987)\n.  DNA identification of a suspect in a violent crime provides critical information to the police and judicial officials in making a determination of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s future dangerousness.  This inquiry always has entailed some scrutiny beyond the name on the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s driver\xe2\x80\x99s license.  For example, Maryland law requires a judge to take into account not only \xe2\x80\x9cthe nature and circumstances of the offense charged\xe2\x80\x9d but also \xe2\x80\x9cthe defendant\xe2\x80\x99s family ties, employment status and history, financial resources, reputation, character and mental condition, length of res-idence in the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  1 Md. Rules 4\xe2\x80\x93216(f)(1)(A), (C) (2013).  Knowing that the defendant is wanted for a previous violent crime based on DNA identification is especially probative of the court\xe2\x80\x99s consideration of \xe2\x80\x9cthe danger of the defendant to the alleged victim, another person, or the community.\xe2\x80\x9d  Rule 4\xe2\x80\x93216(f)(1)(G); see also \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73142 (2006 ed. and Supp. V) (similar requirements).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis interest is not speculative.  In considering laws to require collecting DNA from arrestees, government agencies around the Nation found evidence of numerous cases in which felony arrestees would have been identified as violent through DNA identification matching them to previous crimes but who later committed additional crimes because such identification was not used to detain them.  See Denver\xe2\x80\x99s Study on Preventable Crimes (2009) (three examples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_ Documents/Denver%27s%20Preventable%20Crimes%20 Study.pdf (all Internet materials as visited May 31, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file); Chi-cago\xe2\x80\x99s Study on Preventable Crimes (2005) (five exam- ples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_Documents/ Arrestee_Database/Chicago%20Preventable%20Crimes- Final.pdf; Maryland Study on Preventable Crimes (2008) (three examples), online at http://www.denverda.org/DNA_ Documents/MarylandDNAarresteestudy.pdf.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tPresent capabilities make it possible to complete a DNA identification that provides information essential to determining whether a detained suspect can be released pending trial.  See, e.g., States Brief 18, n.\xc2\xa010 (\xe2\x80\x9cDNA identification database samples have been processed in as few as two days in California, although around 30 days has been average\xe2\x80\x9d).  Regardless of when the initial bail decision is made, release is not appropriate until a further determination is made as to the person\xe2\x80\x99s identity in the sense not only of what his birth certificate states but also what other records and data disclose to give that identity more meaning in the whole context of who the person really is.  And even when release is permitted, the background identity of the suspect is necessary for determining what conditions must be met before release is allowed.  If release is authorized, it may take time for the conditions to be met, and so the time before actual release can be substantial.  For example, in the federal system, defendants released conditionally are detained on average for 112 days; those released on unsecured bond for 37 days; on personal recognizance for 36 days; and on other financial conditions for 27 days.  See Dept. of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Compendium of Federal Justice Statistics 45 (NCJ\xe2\x80\x93213476, Dec. 2006) online at http://bjs.gov/ content/pub/pdf/cfjs04.pdf.  During this entire period, ad-ditional and supplemental data establishing more about the person\xe2\x80\x99s identity and background can provide critical information relevant to the conditions of release and whether to revisit an initial release determination.  The facts of this case are illustrative.  Though the record is not clear, if some thought were being given to releasing the respondent on bail on the gun charge, a release that would take weeks or months in any event, when the DNA report linked him to the prior rape, it would be relevant to the conditions of his release.  The same would be true with a supplemental fingerprint report.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tEven if an arrestee is released on bail, development of DNA identification revealing the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s unknown violent past can and should lead to the revocation of his conditional release.  See \n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73145(a) (providing for revocation of release); see also States Brief 11\xe2\x80\x9312 (discussing examples where bail and diversion determinations were reversed after DNA identified the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s vio- lent history).  Pretrial release of a person charged with a dangerous crime is a most serious responsibility.  It is reason-able in all respects for the State to use an accepted database to determine if an arrestee is the object of suspicion in other serious crimes, suspicion that may provide a strong incentive for the arrestee to escape and flee.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, in the interests of justice, the identification of an arrestee as the perpetrator of some heinous crime may have the salutary effect of freeing a person wrongfully imprisoned for the same offense.  \xe2\x80\x9c[P]rompt [DNA] testing .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. would speed up apprehension of criminals before they commit additional crimes, and prevent the grotesque detention of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. innocent people.\xe2\x80\x9d  J. Dwyer, P. Neufeld, &amp; B. Scheck, Actual Innocence 245 (2000).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBecause proper processing of arrestees is so important and has consequences for every stage of the criminal process, the Court has recognized that the \xe2\x80\x9cgovernmen- tal interests underlying a station-house search of the ar-restee\xe2\x80\x99s person and possessions may in some circumstances be even greater than those supporting a search imme-diately following arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lafayette, 462 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 645.  Thus, the Court has been reluctant to circumscribe the authority of the police to conduct reasonable booking searches.  For example, \xe2\x80\x9c[t]he standards traditionally governing a search incident to lawful arrest are not .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. commuted to the stricter Terry standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  Robinson, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 234.  Nor are these interests in identifica- tion served only by a search of the arrestee himself.  \xe2\x80\x9c[I]nspection of an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s personal property may assist the police in ascertaining or verifying his identity.\xe2\x80\x9d  Lafayette, supra, at 646.  And though the \n \nFifth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection against self-incrimination is not, as a general rule, governed by a reasonableness standard, the Court has held that \xe2\x80\x9cquestions .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. reasonably related to the police\xe2\x80\x99s administrative concerns .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fall outside the protections of Miranda [v.

Law enforcement agencies routinely have used scientific advancements in their standard procedures for the identification of arrestees.  \xe2\x80\x9cPolice had been using photography to capture the faces of criminals almost since its invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  S. Cole, Suspect Identities 20 (2001).  Courts did not dispute that practice, concluding that a \xe2\x80\x9csheriff in making an arrest for a felony on a warrant has the right to exercise a discretion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , [if] he should deem it necessary to the safe-keeping of a prisoner, and to prevent his escape, or to enable him the more readily to retake the prisoner if he should escape, to take his photograph.\xe2\x80\x9d  State ex\xc2\xa0rel. Bruns v. Clausmier, 154 Ind. 599, 601, 603, 57 N.\xc2\xa0E. 541, 542 (1900).  By the time that it had become \xe2\x80\x9cthe daily practice of the police officers and detectives of crime to use photographic pictures for the discovery and identification of criminals,\xe2\x80\x9d the courts likewise had come to the conclusion that \xe2\x80\x9cit would be [a] matter of regret to have its use unduly restricted upon any fanciful theory or constitutional privilege.\xe2\x80\x9d  Shaffer v. United States, 24 App. D.\xc2\xa0C. 417, 426 (1904).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBeginning in 1887, some police adopted more exacting means to identify arrestees, using the system of precise physical measurements pioneered by the French anthropologist Alphonse Bertillon.  Bertillon identification consisted of 10 measurements of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s body, along with a \xe2\x80\x9cscientific analysis of the features of the face and an exact anatomical localization of the various scars, marks, &amp;c., of the body.\xe2\x80\x9d  Defense of the Bertillon System, N.\xc2\xa0Y. Times, Jan. 20, 1896, p. 3.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen a prisoner was brought in, his photograph was taken according to the Bertillon system, and his body measurements were then made.  The measurements were made .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. and noted down on the back of a card or a blotter, and the photograph of the prisoner was expected to be placed on the card.  This card, therefore, furnished both the likeness and description of the prisoner, and was placed in the rogues\xe2\x80\x99 gallery, and copies were sent to various cities where similar records were kept.\xe2\x80\x9d  People ex rel. Jones v. Diehl, 53 App. Div. 645, 646, 65 N.\xc2\xa0Y.\xc2\xa0S. 801, 802 (1900).  As in the present case, the point of taking this information about each arrestee was not limited to verifying that the proper name was on the indictment.  These procedures were used to \xe2\x80\x9cfacilitate the recapture of escaped prisoners,\xe2\x80\x9d to aid \xe2\x80\x9cthe investigation of their past records and personal history,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cto preserve the means of identification for .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fu- ture supervision after discharge.\xe2\x80\x9d  Hodgeman v.

It is known to be a very certain means devised by modern science to reach the desired end, and has become especially important in a time when increased population and vast aggregations of people in urban centers have rendered the notoriety of the individual in the community no longer a ready means of identification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t\xe2\x80\x9cWe find no ground in reason or authority for interfering with a method of identifying persons charged with crime which has now become widely known and frequently practiced.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 69\xe2\x80\x9370.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tBy the middle of the 20th century, it was considered \xe2\x80\x9celementary that a person in lawful custody may be required to submit to photographing and fingerprinting as part of routine identification processes.\xe2\x80\x9d  Smith v.

The additional intrusion upon the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s privacy beyond that associated with fingerprinting is not significant, see Part V, infra, and DNA is a markedly more accurate form of identifying arrestees.  A suspect who has changed his facial features to evade photographic identification or even one who has undertaken the more arduous task of altering his fingerprints cannot escape the revealing power of his DNA.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe respondent\xe2\x80\x99s primary objection to this analogy is that DNA identification is not as fast as fingerprinting, and so it should not be considered to be the 21st-century equivalent.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 53.  But rapid analysis of fingerprints is itself of recent vintage.  The FBI\xe2\x80\x99s vaunted Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System (IAFIS) was only \xe2\x80\x9claunched on July 28, 1999.  Prior to this time, the processing of .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. fingerprint submissions was largely a manual, labor-intensive process, taking weeks or months to process a single submission.\xe2\x80\x9d  Federal Bureau of Investigation, Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System, online at http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ fingerprints_biometrics/iafis/iafis.  It was not the advent of this technology that rendered fingerprint analysis constitutional in a single moment.  The question of how long it takes to process identifying information obtained from a valid search goes only to the efficacy of the search for its purpose of prompt identification, not the constitutionality of the search.  Cf. Ontario v. Quon, 560 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2010) (slip op., at 15).  Given the importance of DNA in the identification of police records pertaining to arrestees and the need to refine and confirm that identity for its important bearing on the decision to continue release on bail or to impose of new conditions, DNA serves an essential purpose despite the existence of delays such as the one that occurred in this case.  Even so, the delay in processing DNA from arrestees is being reduced to a substantial degree by rapid technical advances.  See, e.g., At-torney General DeWine Announces Significant Drop in DNA Turnaround Time (Jan. 4, 2013) (DNA processing time reduced from 125 days in 2010 to 20 days in 2012), online at http://ohioattorneygeneral.gov/Media/News-Releases/January- 2013/Attorney-General-DeWine-Announces-Significant- Drop; Gov. Jindal Announces Elimination of DNA Backlog, DNA Unit Now Operating in Real Time (Nov. 17, 2011) (average DNA report time reduced from a year or more in 2009 to 20 days in 2011), online at http:// www.gov.state.la.us/index.cfm?md=newsroom&amp;tmp=detail&amp;articleID=3102.  And the FBI has already begun testing devices that will enable police to process the DNA of arrestees within 90 minutes.  See Brief for National District Attorneys Association as Amicus Curiae 20\xe2\x80\x9321; Tr. of Oral Arg. 17.  An assessment and understanding of the reasonableness of this minimally invasive search of a person detained for a serious crime should take account of these technical advances.  Just as fingerprinting was constitutional for generations prior to the introduction of IAFIS, DNA identification of arrestees is a permissible tool of law enforcement today.  New technology will only further improve its speed and therefore its effectiveness.  And, as noted above, actual release of a serious offender as a routine matter takes weeks or months in any event.  By identifying not only who the arrestee is but also what other available records disclose about his past to show who he is, the police can ensure that they have the proper person under arrest and that they have made the necessary arrangements for his custody; and, just as important, they can also prevent suspicion against or prosecution of the innocent.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn sum, there can be little reason to question \xe2\x80\x9cthe legitimate interest of the government in knowing for an absolute certainty the identity of the person arrested, in knowing whether he is wanted elsewhere, and in ensuring his identification in the event he flees prosecution.\xe2\x80\x9d  3 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa75.3(c), p. 216 (5th ed. 2012).  To that end, courts have confirmed that the \n \nFourth Amendment allows police to take certain routine \xe2\x80\x9cadministrative steps incident to arrest\xe2\x80\x94i.e., .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. book[ing], photograph[ing], and fingerprint[ing].\xe2\x80\x9d  McLaughlin, 500 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 58.  DNA identification of arrestees, of the type approved by the Maryland statute here at issue, is \xe2\x80\x9cno more than an extension of methods of identification long used in dealing with persons under arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  Kelly, 55 F. \xc2\xa02d, at 69.  In the balance of reasonableness required by the \n \nFourth Amendment, therefore, the Court must give great weight both to the significant government interest at stake in the identification of arrestees and to the unmatched potential of DNA identification to serve that interest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tV\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H2">\n\t\t\t\tA\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBy comparison to this substantial government interest and the unique effectiveness of DNA identification, the intrusion of a cheek swab to obtain a DNA sample is a minimal one.  True, a significant government interest does not alone suffice to justify a search.  The government interest must outweigh the degree to which the search in-vades an individual\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate expectations of privacy.  In considering those expectations in this case, however, the necessary predicate of a valid arrest for a serious offense is fundamental.  \xe2\x80\x9cAlthough the underlying command of the \n \nFourth Amendment is always that searches and seizures be reasonable, what is reasonable depends on the context within which a search takes place.\xe2\x80\x9d  New Jersey v. T.\xc2\xa0L.\xc2\xa0O., \n\n469 U.\xc2\xa0S. 325, \n337 (1985)\n.  \xe2\x80\x9c[T]he legitimacy of certain privacy expectations vis-\xc3\xa0-vis the State may depend upon the individual\xe2\x80\x99s legal relationship with the State.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 654.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reasonableness of any search must be considered in the context of the person\xe2\x80\x99s legitimate expectations of privacy.

Likewise, the Court has used a context-specific benchmark inapplicable to the public at large when \xe2\x80\x9cthe expectations of privacy of covered employees are diminished by reason of their participa-tion in an industry that is regulated pervasively,\xe2\x80\x9d Skinner, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 627, or when \xe2\x80\x9cthe \xe2\x80\x98operational realities of the workplace\xe2\x80\x99 may render entirely reasonable certain work-related intrusions by supervisors and co-workers that might be viewed as unreasonable in other contexts,\xe2\x80\x9d Von Raab, 489 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 671.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe expectations of privacy of an individual taken into police custody \xe2\x80\x9cnecessarily [are] of a diminished scope.\xe2\x80\x9d  Bell, 441 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 557.  \xe2\x80\x9c[B]oth the person and the property in his immediate possession may be searched at the station house.\xe2\x80\x9d  United States v. Edwards, \n\n415 U.\xc2\xa0S. 800, \n803 (1974)\n.  A search of the detainee\xe2\x80\x99s person when he is booked into custody may \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98involve a relatively extensive exploration,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Robinson, 414 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 227, including \xe2\x80\x9crequir[ing] at least some detainees to lift their genitals or cough in a squatting position,\xe2\x80\x9d Florence, 566 U.\xc2\xa0S., at ___ (slip op., at 13).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn this critical respect, the search here at issue differs from the sort of programmatic searches of either the public at large or a particular class of regulated but otherwise law-abiding citizens that the Court has previously labeled as \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98special needs\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d searches.  Chandler v. Miller, \n\n520 U.\xc2\xa0S. 305, \n314 (1997)\n.  When the police stop a motorist at a checkpoint, see Indianapolis v. Edmond, \n\n531 U.\xc2\xa0S. 32 (2000)\n, or test a political candidate for illegal narcotics, see Chandler, supra, they intrude upon substantial expectations of privacy.  So the Court has insisted on some purpose other than \xe2\x80\x9cto detect evidence of ordinary criminal wrongdoing\xe2\x80\x9d to justify these searches in the absence of individualized suspicion.  Edmond, supra, at 38.  Once an individual has been arrested on probable cause for a dangerous offense that may require detention before trial, however, his or her expectations of privacy and freedom from police scrutiny are reduced.  DNA identification like that at issue here thus does not require consideration of any unique needs that would be required to justify searching the average citizen.  The special needs cases, though in full accord with the result reached here, do not have a direct bearing on the issues presented in this case, because unlike the search of a citizen who has not been suspected of a wrong, a detainee has a reduced expectation of privacy.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe reasonableness inquiry here considers two other circumstances in which the Court has held that particularized suspicion is not categorically required: \xe2\x80\x9cdiminished expectations of privacy [and] minimal intrusions.\xe2\x80\x9d  McArthur, 531 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 330.  This is not to suggest that any search is acceptable solely because a person is in custody.  Some searches, such as invasive surgery, see Winston, \n\n470 U.\xc2\xa0S. 753\n, or a search of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s home, see Chimel v. California, \n\n395 U.\xc2\xa0S. 752 (1969)\n, involve either greater intrusions or higher expectations of privacy than are present in this case.  In those situations, when the Court must \xe2\x80\x9cbalance the privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns to determine if the intrusion was rea-sonable,\xe2\x80\x9d McArthur, supra, at 331, the privacy-related concerns are weighty enough that the search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tHere, by contrast to the approved standard procedures incident to any arrest detailed above, a buccal swab involves an even more brief and still minimal intrusion.  A gentle rub along the inside of the cheek does not break the skin, and it \xe2\x80\x9cinvolves virtually no risk, trauma, or pain.\xe2\x80\x9d  Schmerber, 384 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 771.  \xe2\x80\x9cA crucial factor in analyzing the magnitude of the intrusion .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is the extent to which the procedure may threaten the safety or health of the individual,\xe2\x80\x9d Winston, supra, at 761, and nothing suggests that a buccal swab poses any physical danger whatsoever.  A brief intrusion of an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s person is subject to the \n \nFourth Amendment, but a swab of this nature does not increase the indignity already attendant to normal incidents of arrest.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn addition the processing of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s DNA sam-ple\xe2\x80\x99s 13 CODIS loci did not intrude on respondent\xe2\x80\x99s privacy in a way that would make his DNA identification unconstitutional.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFirst, as already noted, the CODIS loci come from noncoding parts of the DNA that do not reveal the genetic traits of the arrestee.  While science can always progress further, and those progressions may have \n \nFourth Amendment consequences, alleles at the CODIS loci \xe2\x80\x9care not at present revealing information beyond identification.\xe2\x80\x9d  Katsanis &amp; Wagner, Characterization of the Standard and Recommended CODIS Markers, 58 J. Forensic Sci. S169, S171 (2013).  The argument that the testing at issue in this case reveals any private medical information at all is open to dispute.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAnd even if non-coding alleles could provide some information, they are not in fact tested for that end.  It is undisputed that law enforcement officers analyze DNA for the sole purpose of generating a unique identifying number against which future samples may be matched.  This parallels a similar safeguard based on actual practice in the school drug-testing context, where the Court deemed it \xe2\x80\x9csignificant that the tests at issue here look only for drugs, and not for whether the student is, for example, epileptic, pregnant, or diabetic.\xe2\x80\x9d  Vernonia School Dist. 47J, 515 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 658.  If in the future police analyze samples to determine, for instance, an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s predisposition for a particular disease or other hereditary factors not relevant to identity, that case would present additional privacy concerns not present here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tFinally, the Act provides statutory protections that guard against further invasion of privacy.  As noted above, the Act requires that \xe2\x80\x9c[o]nly DNA records that directly relate to the identification of individuals shall be collected and stored.\xe2\x80\x9d  Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505(b)(1).  No purpose other than identification is permissible: \xe2\x80\x9cA person may not willfully test a DNA sample for information that does not relate to the identification of individuals as specified in this subtitle.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93512(c).  This Court has noted often that \xe2\x80\x9ca \xe2\x80\x98statutory or regulatory duty to avoid unwarranted disclosures\xe2\x80\x99 generally allays .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. privacy concerns.\xe2\x80\x9d  NASA v. Nelson, 562 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2011) (slip op., at 20) (quoting Whalen v. Roe, \n\n429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 589, \n605 (1977)\n).  The Court need not speculate about the risks posed \xe2\x80\x9cby a system that did not contain comparable security provisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Id., at 606.  In light of the scientific and statutory safeguards, once respondent\xe2\x80\x99s DNA was lawfully collected the STR analysis of respondent\xe2\x80\x99s DNA pursuant to CODIS procedures did not amount to a significant invasion of privacy that would render the DNA identification impermissible under the \n \nFourth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn light of the context of a valid arrest supported by probable cause respondent\xe2\x80\x99s expectations of privacy were not offended by the minor intrusion of a brief swab of his cheeks.  By contrast, that same context of arrest gives rise to significant state interests in identifying respondent not only so that the proper name can be attached to his charges but also so that the criminal justice system can make informed decisions concerning pretrial custody.  Upon these considerations the Court concludes that DNA identification of arrestees is a reasonable search that can be considered part of a routine booking procedure.  When officers make an arrest supported by probable cause to hold for a serious offense and they bring the suspect to the station to be detained in custody, taking and analyzing a cheek swab of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s DNA is, like fingerprinting and photographing, a legitimate police booking procedure that is reasonable under the \n \nFourth Amendment.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe judgment of the Court of Appeals of Maryland is reversed.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-FlushRgtPara">\n\t\t\t\tIt is so ordered.\n\t\t\t</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class="hidden-content" id="tab-opinion-1970667">\n<div class="-display-inline-block text-left">\n<p style="p-SCUSNamePlate">\n\t\t\t\tSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CaseNumber">\n\t\t\t\tNo. 12\xe2\x80\x93207\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Rule">\n\t\t\t\t_________________\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-A">\n\t\t\t\tMARYLAND, PETITIONER v.

It is only when a governmental purpose aside from crime-solving is at stake that we engage in the free-form \xe2\x80\x9creasonableness\xe2\x80\x9d inquiry that the Court indulges at length today.  To put it another way, both the legitimacy of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s method and the correctness of its outcome hinge entirely on the truth of a single proposition: that the primary purpose of these DNA searches is something other than simply discovering evidence of criminal wrongdoing.  As I detail below, that proposition is wrong.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tB\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court alludes at several points (see ante, at 11, 25) to the fact that King was an arrestee, and arrestees may be validly searched incident to their arrest.  But the Court does not really rest on this principle, and for good reason: The objects of a search incident to arrest must be either (1) weapons or evidence that might easily be destroyed, or (2) evidence relevant to the crime of arrest.  See Arizona v. Gant, \n\n556 U. S. 332\n\xe2\x80\x93344 (2009); Thornton v. United States, \n\n541 U. S. 615, \n632 (2004)\n (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment).  Neither is the object of the search at issue here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court hastens to clarify that it does not mean to approve invasive surgery on arrestees or warrantless searches of their homes.  Ante, at 25.  That the Court feels the need to disclaim these consequences is as damning a criticism of its suspicionless-search regime as any I can muster.  And the Court\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to distinguish those hypothetical searches from this real one is unconvincing.  We are told that the \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy-related concerns\xe2\x80\x9d in the search of a home \xe2\x80\x9care weighty enough that the search may require a warrant, notwithstanding the diminished expectations of privacy of the arrestee.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 26.  But why are the \xe2\x80\x9cprivacy-related concerns\xe2\x80\x9d not also \xe2\x80\x9cweighty\xe2\x80\x9d when an intrusion into the body is at stake?  (The \n \nFourth Amendment lists \xe2\x80\x9cpersons\xe2\x80\x9d first among the entities protected against unreasonable searches and seizures.)  And could the police engage, without any suspicion of wrongdoing, in a \xe2\x80\x9cbrief and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. minimal\xe2\x80\x9d intrusion into the home of an arrestee\xe2\x80\x94perhaps just peeking around the curtilage a bit?  See ante, at 26.  Obviously not.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tAt any rate, all this discussion is beside the point.  No matter the degree of invasiveness, suspicionless searches are never allowed if their principal end is ordinary crime-solving.  A search incident to arrest either serves other ends (such as officer safety, in a search for weapons) or is not suspicionless (as when there is reason to believe the arrestee possesses evidence relevant to the crime of arrest).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSensing (correctly) that it needs more, the Court elaborates at length the ways that the search here served the special purpose of \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying\xe2\x80\x9d King.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F1" name="T1">\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  But that seems to me quite wrong\xe2\x80\x94unless what one means by \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying\xe2\x80\x9d someone is \xe2\x80\x9csearching for evidence that he has committed crimes unrelated to the crime of his arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  At points the Court does appear to use \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying\xe2\x80\x9d in that peculiar sense\xe2\x80\x94claiming, for example, that knowing \xe2\x80\x9can arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s past conduct is essential to an assessment of the danger he poses.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 15.  If identifying someone means finding out what unsolved crimes he has committed, then identification is indistinguishable from the ordinary law-enforcement aims that have never been thought to justify a suspicionless search.  Searching every lawfully stopped car, for example, might turn up information about unsolved crimes the driver had committed, but no one would say that such a search was aimed at \xe2\x80\x9cidentifying\xe2\x80\x9d him, and\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-Normal">\n</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\tno court would hold such a search lawful.  I will therefore assume that the Court means that the DNA search at issue here was useful to \xe2\x80\x9cidentify\xe2\x80\x9d King in the normal sense of that word\xe2\x80\x94in the sense that would identify the author of Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation as Jeremy Bentham.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe portion of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that explains the identification rationale is strangely silent on the actual workings of the DNA search at issue here.  To know those facts is to be instantly disabused of the notion that what happened had anything to do with identifying King.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tKing was arrested on April 10, 2009, on charges unrelated to the case before us.  That same day, April 10, the police searched him and seized the DNA evidence at issue here.  What happened next?  Reading the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, particularly its insistence that the search was necessary to know \xe2\x80\x9cwho [had] been arrested,\xe2\x80\x9d  ante, at 11, one might guess that King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA was swiftly processed and his identity thereby confirmed\xe2\x80\x94perhaps against some master database of known DNA profiles, as is done for fingerprints.  After all, was not the suspicionless search here crucial to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cinordinate risks for facility staff\xe2\x80\x9d or to \xe2\x80\x9cexisting detainee population,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 14?  Surely, then\xe2\x80\x94surely\xe2\x80\x94the State of Maryland got cracking on those grave risks immediately, by rushing to identify King with his DNA as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tNothing could be further from the truth.  Maryland officials did not even begin the process of testing King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA that day.  Or, actually, the next day.  Or the day after that.  And that was for a simple reason: Maryland law forbids them to do so.  A \xe2\x80\x9cDNA sample collected from an individual charged with a crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. may not be tested or placed in the statewide DNA data base system prior to the first scheduled arraignment date.\xe2\x80\x9d  Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93504(d)(1) (Lexis 2011) (emphasis added).  And King\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance in court was not until three days after his arrest.  (I suspect, though, that they did not wait three days to ask his name or take his fingerprints.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThis places in a rather different light the Court\xe2\x80\x99s solemn declaration that the search here was necessary so that King could be identified at \xe2\x80\x9cevery stage of the criminal process.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 18.  I hope that the Maryland officials who read the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion do not take it seriously.  Acting on the Court\xe2\x80\x99s misperception of Maryland law could lead to jail time.  See Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93512(c)\xe2\x80\x93(e) (punishing by up to five years\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment anyone who obtains or tests DNA information except as provided by statute).  Does the Court really believe that Maryland did not know whom it was arraigning?  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s response is to imagine that release on bail could take so long that the DNA results are returned in time, or perhaps that bail could be revoked if the DNA test turned up incriminating information.  Ante, at 16\xe2\x80\x9317.  That is no answer at all.  If the purpose of this Act is to assess \xe2\x80\x9cwhether [King] should be released on bail,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 15, why would it possibly forbid the DNA testing process to begin until King was arraigned?  Why would Maryland resign itself to simply hoping that the bail decision will drag out long enough that the \xe2\x80\x9cidentification\xe2\x80\x9d  can succeed before the arrestee is released?  The truth, known to Maryland and increasingly to the reader: this search had nothing to do with establishing King\xe2\x80\x99s identity.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt gets worse.  King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA sample was not received by the Maryland State Police\xe2\x80\x99s Forensic Sciences Division until April 23, 2009\xe2\x80\x94two weeks after his arrest.  It sat in that office, ripening in a storage area, until the custodians got around to mailing it to a lab for testing on June 25, 2009\xe2\x80\x94two months after it was received, and nearly three since King\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  After it was mailed, the data from the lab tests were not available for several more weeks, until July 13, 2009, which is when the test results were entered into Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s DNA database, together with information identifying the person from whom the sample was taken.  Meanwhile, bail had been set, King had engaged in discovery, and he had requested a speedy trial\xe2\x80\x94presumably not a trial of John Doe.  It was not until August 4, 2009\xe2\x80\x94four months after King\xe2\x80\x99s arrest\xe2\x80\x94that the forwarded sample transmitted (without identifying information) from the Maryland DNA database to the Federal Bureau of Investigation\xe2\x80\x99s national database was matched with a sample taken from the scene of an unrelated crime years earlier.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tA more specific description of exactly what happened at this point illustrates why, by definition, King could not have been identified by this match.  The FBI\xe2\x80\x99s DNA database (known as CODIS) consists of two distinct collections.  FBI, CODIS and NDIS Fact Sheet, http:// www.fbi.gov/about-us/lab/codis/codis-and-ndis-fact-sheet (all Internet materials as visited May 31, 2013, and available in Clerk of Court\xe2\x80\x99s case file).  One of them, the one to which King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA was submitted, consists of DNA samples taken from known convicts or arrestees.  I will refer to this as the \xe2\x80\x9cConvict and Arrestee Collection.\xe2\x80\x9d  The other collection consists of samples taken from crime scenes; I will refer to this as the \xe2\x80\x9cUnsolved Crimes Collection.\xe2\x80\x9d  The Convict and Arrestee Collection stores \xe2\x80\x9cno names or other personal identifiers of the offenders, arrestees, or detainees.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Rather, it contains only the DNA profile itself, the name of the agency that submitted it, the laboratory personnel who analyzed it, and an identification number for the specimen.  Ibid.  This is because the submitting state laboratories are expected already to know the identities of the convicts and arrestees from whom samples are taken.  (And, of course, they do.)\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMoreover, the CODIS system works by checking to see whether any of the samples in the Unsolved Crimes Collection match any of the samples in the Convict and Arrestee Collection.  Ibid.  That is sensible, if what one wants to do is solve those cold cases, but note what it requires: that the identity of the people whose DNA has been entered in the Convict and Arrestee Collection already be known.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F2" name="T2">\n\t\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t  If one wanted to identify someone in custody using his DNA, the logical thing to do would be to compare that DNA against the Convict and Arrestee Collection: to search, in other words, the collection that could be used (by checking back with the submitting state agency) to identify people, rather than the collection of evidence from unsolved crimes, whose perpetrators are by definition unknown.  But that is not what was done.  And that is because this search had nothing to do with identification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIn fact, if anything was \xe2\x80\x9cidentified\xe2\x80\x9d at the moment that the DNA database returned a match, it was not King\xe2\x80\x94his identity was already known.  (The docket for the original criminal charges lists his full name, his race, his sex, his height, his weight, his date of birth, and his address.)  Rather, what the August 4 match \xe2\x80\x9cidentified\xe2\x80\x9d was the previously-taken sample from the earlier crime.  That sample was genuinely mysterious to Maryland; the State knew that it had probably been left by the victim\xe2\x80\x99s attacker, but nothing else.  King was not identified by his association with the sample; rather, the sample was identified by its association with King.  The Court effectively destroys its own \xe2\x80\x9cidentification\xe2\x80\x9d theory when it acknowledges that the object of this search was \xe2\x80\x9cto see what [was] already known about [King].\xe2\x80\x9d  King was who he was, and  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tvolumes of his biography could not make him any more or any less King.  No minimally competent speaker of English would say, upon noticing a known arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s similarity \xe2\x80\x9cto a wanted poster of a previously unidentified suspect,\xe2\x80\x9d ante, at 13, that the arrestee had thereby been identified.  It was the previously unidentified suspect who had been identified\xe2\x80\x94just as, here, it was the previously unidentified rapist.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t2\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThat taking DNA samples from arrestees has nothing to do with identifying them is confirmed not just by actual practice (which the Court ignores) but by the enabling statute itself (which the Court also ignores).  The Maryland Act at issue has a section helpfully entitled \xe2\x80\x9cPurpose of collecting and testing DNA samples.\xe2\x80\x9d  Md. Pub. Saf. Code Ann. \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505.  (One would expect such a section to play a somewhat larger role in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s analysis of the Act\xe2\x80\x99s purpose\xe2\x80\x94which is to say, at least some role.)  That provision lists five purposes for which DNA samples may be tested.  By this point, it will not surprise the reader to learn that the Court\xe2\x80\x99s imagined purpose is not among them.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tInstead, the law provides that DNA samples are collected and tested, as a matter of Maryland law, \xe2\x80\x9cas part of an official investigation into a crime.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505(a)(2).  (Or, as our suspicionless-search cases would put it: for ordinary law-enforcement purposes.)  That is certainly how everyone has always understood the Maryland Act until today.  The Governor of Maryland, in commenting on our  decision to hear this case, said that he was glad, because \xe2\x80\x9c[a]llowing law enforcement to collect DNA samples .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. is absolutely critical to our efforts to continue driving down crime,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cbolsters our efforts to resolve open investigations and bring them to a resolution.\xe2\x80\x9d  Marbella, Supreme Court Will Review Md. DNA Law, Baltimore Sun, Nov. 10, 2012, pp.\xc2\xa01, 14.  The attorney general of Maryland remarked that he \xe2\x80\x9clook[ed] forward to the opportunity to defend this important crime-fighting tool,\xe2\x80\x9d and praised the DNA database for helping to \xe2\x80\x9cbring to justice violent perpetrators.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  Even this Court\xe2\x80\x99s order staying the decision below states that the statute \xe2\x80\x9cprovides a valuable tool for investigating unsolved crimes and thereby helping to remove violent offenders from the general population\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94with, unsurprisingly, no mention of identity.  567 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2012) (Roberts, C.\xc2\xa0J., in chambers) (slip op., at 3).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tMore devastating still for the Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cidentification\xe2\x80\x9d theory, the statute does enumerate two instances in which a DNA sample may be tested for the purpose of identification: \xe2\x80\x9cto help identify human remains,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505(a)(3) (emphasis added), and \xe2\x80\x9cto help identify missing individuals,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505(a)(4) (emphasis added).  No mention of identifying arrestees.  Inclusio unius est exclusio alterius.  And note again that Maryland forbids using DNA records \xe2\x80\x9cfor any purposes other than those specified\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94it is actually a crime to do so.  \xc2\xa72\xe2\x80\x93505(b)(2).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Maryland regulations implementing the Act confirm what is now monotonously obvious: These DNA searches have nothing to do with identification.  For example, if someone is arrested and law enforcement determines that \xe2\x80\x9ca convicted offender Statewide DNA Data Base sample already exists\xe2\x80\x9d for that arrestee, \xe2\x80\x9cthe agency is not required to obtain a new sample.\xe2\x80\x9d  Code of Md. Regs., tit. 29, \xc2\xa705.01.04(B)(4) (2011).  But how could the State know if an arrestee has already had his DNA sample collected, if the point of the sample is to identify who he is?  Of course, if the DNA sample is instead taken in order to investigate crimes, this restriction makes perfect sense: Having previously placed an identified someone\xe2\x80\x99s DNA on file to check against available crime-scene evidence, there is no sense in going to the expense of taking a new sample.  Maryland\xe2\x80\x99s regulations further require that the \xe2\x80\x9cindivid- ual collecting a sample .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. verify the identity of the individual from whom a sample is taken by name and, if applicable, State identification (SID) number.\xe2\x80\x9d  \xc2\xa705.01.04(K).  (But how?)  And after the sample is taken, it continues to be identified by the individual\xe2\x80\x99s name, fingerprints, etc., see \xc2\xa705.01.07(B)\xe2\x80\x94rather than (as the Court believes) being used to identify individuals.  See \xc2\xa705.01.07(B)(2) (\xe2\x80\x9cRecords and specimen information shall be identified by .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. [the] [n]ame of the donor\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added)).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tSo, to review: DNA testing does not even begin until after arraignment and bail decisions are already made.  The samples sit in storage for months, and take weeks to test.  When they are tested, they are checked against the Unsolved Crimes Collection\xe2\x80\x94rather than the Convict and Arrestee Collection, which could be used to identify them.  The Act forbids the Court\xe2\x80\x99s purpose (identification), but prescribes as its purpose what our suspicionless-search cases forbid (\xe2\x80\x9cofficial investigation into a crime\xe2\x80\x9d).  Against all of that, it is safe to say that if the Court\xe2\x80\x99s identification theory is not wrong, there is no such thing as error.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\tII\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also attempts to bolster its identification theory with a series of inapposite analogies.  See ante, at 18\xe2\x80\x9323.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIs not taking DNA samples the same, asks the Court, as taking a person\xe2\x80\x99s photograph?  No\xe2\x80\x94because that is not a \n \nFourth Amendment search at all.  It does not involve a physical intrusion onto the person, see Florida v. Jardines, \n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1\n, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 3), and we have never held that merely taking a person\xe2\x80\x99s photograph invades any recognized \xe2\x80\x9cexpectation of privacy,\xe2\x80\x9d see Katz v. United States, \n\n389 U.\xc2\xa0S. 347 (1967)\n.  Thus, it is unsurprising that the cases the Court cites as authorizing photo-taking do not even mention the \n \nFourth Amendment.  See State ex\xc2\xa0rel. Bruns v. Clausmier, 154 Ind. 599, 57 N.\xc2\xa0E. 541 (1900) (libel), Shaffer v. United States, 24 App. D.\xc2\xa0C. 417 (1904) (\n \nFifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tBut is not the practice of DNA searches, the Court asks, the same as taking \xe2\x80\x9cBertillon\xe2\x80\x9d measurements\xe2\x80\x94noting an arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s height, shoe size, and so on, on the back of a photograph?  No, because that system was not, in the ordinary case, used to solve unsolved crimes.  It is possible, I suppose, to imagine situations in which such measurements might be useful to generate leads.  (If witnesses described a very tall burglar, all the \xe2\x80\x9ctall man\xe2\x80\x9d cards could then be pulled.)  But the obvious primary purpose of such measurements, as the Court\xe2\x80\x99s description of them makes clear, was to verify that, for example, the person arrested today is the same person that was arrested a year ago.  Which is to say, Bertillon measurements were actually used as a system of identification, and drew their primary usefulness from that task.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F3" name="T3">\n\t\t\t\t\t3\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tIt is on the fingerprinting of arrestees, however, that the Court relies most heavily.  Ante, at 20\xe2\x80\x9323.  The Court does not actually say whether it believes that taking a person\xe2\x80\x99s fingerprints is a \n \nFourth Amendment search, and our cases provide no ready answer to that question.  Even assuming so, however, law enforcement\xe2\x80\x99s post-arrest use of fingerprints could not be more different from its post-arrest use of DNA.  Fingerprints of arrestees are taken primarily to identify them (though that process sometimes solves  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tcrimes); the DNA of arrestees is taken to solve crimes (and nothing else).  Contrast CODIS, the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s nationwide DNA database, with IAFIS, the FBI\xe2\x80\x99s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification System.

Ante, at 22. This bold statement is bereft of citation to authority because there is none for it.  The \xe2\x80\x9cgreat expansion in fingerprinting came before the modern era of \n \nFourth Amendment jurisprudence,\xe2\x80\x9d and so we were never asked to decide the legitimacy of the practice.  United States v. Kincade, 379 F.\xc2\xa03d 813, 874 (CA9 2004) (Kozinski, J., dissenting).  As fingerprint databases expanded from convicted criminals, to arrestees, to civil servants, to immigrants, to everyone with a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, Americans simply \xe2\x80\x9cbecame accustomed to having our fingerprints on file in some government database.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ibid.  But it is wrong to suggest that this was uncontroversial at the time, or that this Court blessed universal fingerprinting for \xe2\x80\x9cgenerations\xe2\x80\x9d before it was possible to use it effectively for identification.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also assures us that \xe2\x80\x9cthe delay in processing DNA from arrestees is being reduced to a substantial degree by rapid technical advances.\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 22.  The idea, presumably, is that the snail\xe2\x80\x99s pace in this case is atypical, so that DNA is now readily usable for identification.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s proof, however, is nothing but a pair of press releases\xe2\x80\x94each of which turns out to undercut this argument.  We learn in them that reductions in backlog have enabled Ohio and Louisiana crime labs to analyze a submitted DNA sample in twenty days.\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F5" name="T5">\n\t\t\t\t\t5\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\t  But that is still longer than the eighteen days that Maryland needed to analyze King\xe2\x80\x99s sample, once it worked its way through the State\xe2\x80\x99s labyrinthine bureaucracy. What this illustrates is that these times do not take into account the many other sources of delay.  So if the Court means to suggest that Maryland is unusual, that may be right\xe2\x80\x94it may qualify in this context as a paragon of efficiency.  (Indeed, the Governor of Maryland was hailing the elimination of that State\xe2\x80\x99s backlog more than five years ago.  See Wheeler, O\xe2\x80\x99Malley Wants to Expand DNA Testing, Baltimore Sun, Jan. 11, 2008, p. 5B.)  Meanwhile, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding will result in the dumping of a large number of arrestee samples\xe2\x80\x94many from minor offenders\xe2\x80\x94onto an already overburdened system: Nearly one-third of Americans will be arrested for some offense by age 23.  See Brame, Turner, Paternoster, &amp; Bushway, Cumulative Prevalence of Arrest From Ages 8 to 23 in a National Sample, 129 Pediatrics 21 (2011).\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court also accepts uncritically the Government\xe2\x80\x99s representation at oral argument that it is developing devices that will be able to test DNA in mere minutes.  At most, this demonstrates that it may one day be possible to design a program that uses DNA for a purpose other than crime-solving\xe2\x80\x94not that Maryland has in fact designed such a program today.  And that is the main point, which the Court\xe2\x80\x99s discussion of the brave new world of instant DNA analysis should not obscure.  The issue before us is not whether DNA can some day be used for identification; nor even whether it can today be used for identification; but whether it was used for identification here.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday, it can fairly be said that fingerprints really are used to identify people\xe2\x80\x94so well, in fact, that there would  \n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\tbe no need for the expense of a separate, wholly redundant DNA confirmation of the same information.  What DNA adds\xe2\x80\x94what makes it a valuable weapon in the law-enforcement arsenal\xe2\x80\x94is the ability to solve unsolved crimes, by matching old crime-scene evidence against the profiles of people whose identities are already known.  That is what was going on when King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA was taken, and we should not disguise the fact.  Solving unsolved crimes is a noble objective, but it occupies a lower place in the American pantheon of noble objectives than the protection of our people from suspicionless law-enforcement searches.  The \n \nFourth Amendment must prevail.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-H1">\n\t\t\t\t*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe Court disguises the vast (and scary) scope of its holding by promising a limitation it cannot deliver.  The Court repeatedly says that DNA testing, and entry into a national DNA registry, will not befall thee and me, dear reader, but only those arrested for \xe2\x80\x9cserious offense[s].\xe2\x80\x9d  Ante, at 28; see also ante, at 1, 9, 14, 17, 22, 23, 24 (repeatedly limiting the analysis to \xe2\x80\x9cserious offenses\xe2\x80\x9d).  I cannot imagine what principle could possibly justify this limitation, and the Court does not attempt to suggest any.  If one believes that DNA will \xe2\x80\x9cidentify\xe2\x80\x9d someone arrested for assault, he must believe that it will \xe2\x80\x9cidentify\xe2\x80\x9d someone arrested for a traffic offense.  This Court does not base its judgments on senseless distinctions.  At the end of the day, logic will out.  When there comes before us the taking of DNA from an arrestee for a traffic violation, the Court will predictably (and quite rightly) say, \xe2\x80\x9cWe can find no significant difference between this case and King.\xe2\x80\x9d  Make no mistake about it: As an entirely predictable consequence of today\xe2\x80\x99s decision, your DNA can be taken and entered into a national DNA database if you are ever arrested, rightly or wrongly, and for whatever reason.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tThe most regrettable aspect of the suspicionless search that occurred here is that it proved to be quite unnecessary.  All parties concede that it would have been entirely permissible, as far as the \n \nFourth Amendment is concerned, for Maryland to take a sample of King\xe2\x80\x99s DNA as a consequence of his conviction for second-degree assault.  So the ironic result of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s error is this: The only arrestees to whom the outcome here will ever make a difference are those who have been acquitted of the crime of arrest (so that their DNA could not have been taken upon conviction).  In other words, this Act manages to burden uniquely the sole group for whom the \n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections ought to be most jealously guarded: people who are innocent of the State\xe2\x80\x99s accusations.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tToday\xe2\x80\x99s judgment will, to be sure, have the beneficial effect of solving more crimes; then again, so would the taking of DNA samples from anyone who flies on an airplane (surely the Transportation Security Administration needs to know the \xe2\x80\x9cidentity\xe2\x80\x9d of the flying public), applies for a driver\xe2\x80\x99s license, or attends a public school.  Perhaps the construction of such a genetic panopticon is wise.  But I doubt that the proud men who wrote the charter of our liberties would have been so eager to open their mouths for royal inspection.\n\t\t\t</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\t\t\t\tI therefore dissent, and hope that today\xe2\x80\x99s incursion upon the \n \nFourth Amendment, like an earlier one,\n\t\t\t\t[<a href="#F6" name="T6">\n\t\t\t\t\t6\n\t\t\t\t</a>]\n\t\t\t\t will some day be repudiated.\n\t\t\t</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0The Court\xe2\x80\x99s insistence (ante, at 25) that our special-needs cases \xe2\x80\x9cdo not have a direct bearing on the issues presented in this case\xe2\x80\x9d is perplexing.  Why spill so much ink on the special need of identification if a special need is not required?  Why not just come out and say that any suspicionless search of an arrestee is allowed if it will be useful to solve crimes?  The Court does not say that because most Members of the Court do not believe it.  So whatever the Court\xe2\x80\x99s major premise\xe2\x80\x94the opinion does not really contain what you would call a rule of decision\xe2\x80\x94the minor premise is \xe2\x80\x9cthis search was used to identify King.\xe2\x80\x9d  The incorrectness of that minor premise will therefore suffice to demonstrate the error in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s result.\n\t</span>\n</div><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T2" name="F2">2</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0By the way, this procedure has nothing to do with exonerating the wrongfully convicted, as the Court soothingly promises.
