UNITED STATES<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES<br/>\n</strong><br/>\n<p align="left">DAVIS <em>v</em>. UNITED STATES</p>\n<p align="left">certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eleventh circuit</p>\n<p align="left">No. 09\xe2\x80\x9311328.\xe2\x80\x83Argued March 21, 2011\xe2\x80\x94Decided June 16, 2011</p>\n<p align="left">While conducting a routine vehicle stop, police arrested petitioner Willie Davis, a passenger, for giving a false name.  After handcuffing Davis and securing the scene, the police searched the vehicle and found Davis\xe2\x80\x99s revolver.  Davis was then indicted on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm.  In a suppression motion, Davis acknowledged that the search of the vehicle complied with existing Eleventh Circuit precedent interpreting <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/index.html">453 U. S. 454</a>, but Davis raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve the issue on appeal.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted.  While his appeal was pending, this Court announced, in <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Gant</em>, 556 U. S. ___, ___, a new rule governing automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants.  The Eleventh Circuit held, under <em>Gant</em>, that the vehicle search at issue violated Davis\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights, but the court declined to suppress the revolver and affirmed Davis\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  </p>\n<p align="left"><em>Held:</em>\xc2\xa0Searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x9320.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(a)\xc2\xa0The exclusionary rule\xe2\x80\x99s sole purpose is to deter future Fourth Amendment violations, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Herring</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/135/index.html">555 U. S. 135</a>, 141, and its operation is limited to situations in which this purpose is \xe2\x80\x9cthought most efficaciously served,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>United States</em> v. <em>Calandra</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/414/338/index.html">414 U. S. 338</a>, 348.  For exclusion to be appropriate, the deterrence benefits of suppression must outweigh the rule\xe2\x80\x99s heavy costs.  Under a line of cases beginning with <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon, </em><a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a>, the result of this cost-benefit analysis turns on the \xe2\x80\x9cflagrancy of the police misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d at issue. <em>Id.</em>, at 909, 911.  When the police exhibit \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9creckless,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cgrossly negligent\xe2\x80\x9d disregard for Fourth Amendment rights, the benefits of exclusion tend to outweigh the costs.  <em>Herring, supra</em>, at 144.  But when the police act with an objectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful, or when their conduct involves only simple, isolated negligence, the deterrent value of suppression is diminished, and exclusion cannot \xe2\x80\x9cpay its way.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Leon</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 909, 919, 908, n.\xc2\xa06; <em>Herring</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 137.  Pp. 6\xe2\x80\x939. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(b)\xc2\xa0Although the search in this case turned out to be unconstitutional under <em>Gant</em>, Davis concedes that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusionary-rule precedents, the acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Pp. 9\xe2\x80\x9311. </p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(c)\xc2\xa0The Court is not persuaded by arguments that other considerations should prevent the good-faith exception from applying in this case.  Pp. 11\xe2\x80\x9319.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(1)\xc2\xa0The argument that the availability of the exclusionary rule to enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, not a good-faith issue, is unpersuasive.  This argument erroneously conflates retroactivity with remedy.  Because Davis\xe2\x80\x99s conviction had not become final when <em>Gant </em>was announced, <em>Gant</em> applies retroactively in this case, and Davis may invoke its newly announced rule as a basis for seeking relief.  See <em>Griffith </em>v.<em> Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, 326, 328.  But retroactive application of a new rule does not determine the question of what remedy the defendant should obtain.  See <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Nevada</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/79/index.html">511 U. S. 79</a>, 83, 84. The remedy of exclusion does not automatically follow from a Fourth Amendment violation, see <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html">514 U. S. 1</a>, 13, and applies only where its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose is effectively advanced,\xe2\x80\x9d<em> Illinois</em> v. <em>Krull</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/480/340/index.html">480 U. S. 340</a>, 347.  The application of the good-faith exception here neither contravenes <em>Griffith</em> nor denies retroactive effect to <em>Gant</em>.  Pp.\xc2\xa012\xe2\x80\x9316.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0(2)\xc2\xa0Nor is the Court persuaded by the argument that applying the good-faith exception to searches conducted in reliance on binding precedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law by discouraging criminal defendants from attacking precedent.  Facilitating the overruling of precedent has never been a relevant consideration in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s exclusionary-rule cases.  In any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent this Court\xe2\x80\x99s review of Fourth Amendment precedents.  If precedent from a federal court of appeals or state court of last resort upholds a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions where the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue, and this Court can grant certiorari in one of those cases.  Davis\xe2\x80\x99s claim that <em>this </em>Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment precedents will be effectively insulated from challenge is overstated.  In many cases, defendants will test this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment precedents by arguing that they are distinguishable.  And at most, this argument might suggest that, in a future case, the Court could allow a petitioner who secures a decision overruling one of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedents to obtain suppression of evidence in that one case.

To supplement\nthe bare text, this Court created the exclusionary rule, a deterrent sanction that bars the prosecution from introducing evidence obtained by way of a Fourth Amendment violation.  The question here is whether to apply this sanction when the police conduct a search in compliance with binding precedent that is later overruled.  Because suppression would do nothing to deter police misconduct in these circumstances, and because it would come at a high cost to both the truth and the public safety, we hold that searches conducted in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent are not subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question presented arises in this case as a result\nof a shift in our Fourth Amendment jurisprudence on searches of automobiles incident to arrests of recent\noccupants.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under this Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Chimel</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/752/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/752/index.html">395 U. S. 752</a> (1969), a police officer who makes a lawful arrest may conduct a warrantless search of the arrestee\xe2\x80\x99s person and the area \xe2\x80\x9cwithin his immediate control.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 763 (internal quotation marks omitted).  This rule \xe2\x80\x9cmay be stated clearly enough,\xe2\x80\x9d but in the early going after <em>Chimel</em> it proved difficult to apply, particularly in cases that involved searches \xe2\x80\x9cinside [of] automobile[s] after the arrestees [we]re no longer in [them].\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/454/index.html">453 U. S. 454</a>, 458\xe2\x80\x93459 (1981).  A number of courts up-held the constitutionality of vehicle searches that were \xe2\x80\x9csubstantially contemporaneous\xe2\x80\x9d with occupants\xe2\x80\x99 arrests.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>]  Other courts disapproved of automobile searches incident to arrests, at least absent some continuing threat that the arrestee might gain access to the vehicle and \xe2\x80\x9cdestroy evidence or grab a weapon.\xe2\x80\x9d[<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>]  In <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton, </em>this<em> </em>Court granted certiorari to resolve the conflict.  See <em>id.</em>, at 459\xe2\x80\x93460.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Belton</em>, a police officer conducting a traffic stop lawfully arrested four occupants of a vehicle and ordered the arrestees to line up, un-handcuffed, along the side of the thruway. <em> Id.</em>, at 456; see Brief for Petitioner in <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 1980, No. 80\xe2\x80\x93328, p. 3.  The officer then searched the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment and found cocaine inside a jacket that lay on the backseat.  <em>Belton</em>, 453 U. S., at 456.  This Court upheld the search as reasonable incident to the occupants\xe2\x80\x99 arrests.  In an opinion that repeatedly stressed the need for a \xe2\x80\x9cstraightforward,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cworkable rule\xe2\x80\x9d to guide police conduct, the Court announced \xe2\x80\x9cthat when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 459\xe2\x80\x93460 (footnote omitted).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For years, <em>Belton</em> was widely understood to have set down a simple, bright-line rule.  Numerous courts read\nthe decision to authorize automobile searches incident to arrests of recent occupants, regardless of whether the arrestee in any particular case was within reaching distance of the vehicle at the time of the search.  See <em>Thornton</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/541/615/index.html">541 U. S. 615</a>, 628 (2004) (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment) (collecting cases).  Even after the arrestee had stepped out of the vehicle and had been subdued by police, the prevailing understanding was that <em>Belton</em> still authorized a substantially contemporaneous search of the automobile\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">Footnote 3</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Not every court, however, agreed with this reading of <em>Belton</em>.  In <em>State</em> v. <em>Gant</em>, 216 Ariz. 1, 162 P.\xc2\xa03d 640 (2007), the Arizona Supreme Court considered an automobile search conducted after the vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s occupant had been arrested, handcuffed, and locked in a patrol car.  The court distinguished <em>Belton</em> as a case in which \xe2\x80\x9cfour unsecured\xe2\x80\x9d arrestees \xe2\x80\x9cpresented an immediate risk of loss of evidence and an obvious threat to [a] lone officer\xe2\x80\x99s safety.\xe2\x80\x9d  216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 643.  The court held that where no such \xe2\x80\x9cexigencies exis[t]\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94where the arrestee has been subdued and the scene secured\xe2\x80\x94the rule of <em>Belton</em> does not apply.  216 Ariz., at 4, 162 P.\xc2\xa03d, at 643.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This Court granted certiorari in <em>Gant</em>, see <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/1230/index.html">552 U. S. 1230</a> (2008), and affirmed in a 5-to-4 decision.  <em>Arizona </em>v. <em>Gant</em>, 556 U. S. ___ (2009).  Four of the Justices in the majority agreed with the Arizona Supreme Court that <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding applies only where \xe2\x80\x9cthe arrestee is unsecured and within reaching distance of the passenger compartment at the time of the search.\xe2\x80\x9d  556 U. S., at ___\n(slip op., at 10).  The four dissenting Justices, by contrast, understood <em>Belton</em> to have explicitly adopted the simple, bright-line rule stated in the <em>Belton</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion.  556 U. S., at ___ (opinion of Alito, J.) (slip op., at 3); see <em>Belton</em>, 453 U. S., at 460 (\xe2\x80\x9c[W]e hold that when a policeman has made a lawful custodial arrest of the occupant of an automobile, he may, as a contemporaneous incident of that arrest, search the passenger compartment of that automobile\xe2\x80\x9d (footnote omitted)).  To limit <em>Belton</em> to cases involving unsecured arrestees, the dissenters thought, was to overrule the decision\xe2\x80\x99s clear holding.  <em>Gant</em>, <em>supra</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x933).  Justice Scalia, who provided the fifth vote to affirm in <em>Gant</em>, agreed with the dissenters\xe2\x80\x99 understanding of <em>Belton</em>\xe2\x80\x99s holding.  556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 1\xe2\x80\x932) (concurring opinion).  Justice Scalia favored a more ex-plicit and complete overruling of <em>Belton</em>, but he joined what became the majority opinion to avoid \xe2\x80\x9ca 4-to-1-to-4\xe2\x80\x9d disposition.  556 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 2\xe2\x80\x934).  As a result, the Court adopted a new, two-part rule under which an automobile search incident to a recent occupant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest is constitutional (1) if the arrestee is within reaching distance of the vehicle during the search, or (2) if the police have reason to believe that the vehicle contains \xe2\x80\x9cevidence relevant to the crime of arrest.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at ___ (slip op., at 9\xe2\x80\x9310) (citing <em>Thornton</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 632 (Scalia, J., concurring in judgment); internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The search at issue in this case took place a full two years before this Court announced its new rule in <em>Gant</em>.  On an April evening in 2007, police officers in Greenville, Alabama, conducted a routine traffic stop that eventually resulted in the arrests of driver Stella Owens (for driving while intoxicated) and passenger Willie Davis (for giving a false name to police).  The police handcuffed both Owens and Davis, and they placed the arrestees in the back of separate patrol cars.  The police then searched the passenger compartment of Owens\xe2\x80\x99s vehicle and found a revolver inside Davis\xe2\x80\x99s jacket pocket.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis was indicted in the Middle District of Alabama on one count of possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.  See 18 U. S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa7922(g)(1).  In his motion to suppress\nthe revolver, Davis acknowledged that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 search fully complied with \xe2\x80\x9cexisting Eleventh Circuit precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 13\xe2\x80\x9315.  Like most courts, the Eleventh Circuit had long read <em>Belton </em>to establish a bright-line rule authorizing substantially contemporaneous vehicle searches incident to arrests of recent occupants.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, 71 F.\xc2\xa03d 819, 822, 824\xe2\x80\x93827 (CA11 1996) (upholding automobile search conducted after the defendant had been \xe2\x80\x9cpulled from the vehicle, handcuffed, laid on the ground, and placed under arrest\xe2\x80\x9d).  Davis recognized that the Dis-trict Court was obligated to follow this precedent, but\nhe raised a Fourth Amendment challenge to preserve \xe2\x80\x9cthe issue for review\xe2\x80\x9d on appeal.  App. 15.  The District Court denied the motion, and Davis was convicted on the firearms charge.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0While Davis\xe2\x80\x99s appeal was pending, this Court decided <em>Gant</em>.  The Eleventh Circuit, in the opinion below, applied <em>Gant</em>\xe2\x80\x99s new rule and held that the vehicle search incident to Davis\xe2\x80\x99s arrest \xe2\x80\x9cviolated [his] Fourth Amendment rights.\xe2\x80\x9d  598 F.\xc2\xa03d 1259, 1263 (CA11 2010).  As for whether this constitutional violation warranted suppression, the Eleventh Circuit viewed that as a separate issue that turned on \xe2\x80\x9cthe potential of exclusion to deter wrongful police conduct.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.</em>, at 1265 (quoting <em>Herring</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/555/135/index.html"></a><a href="/us/555/135/index.html">555 U. S. 135</a>, 137 (2009); internal quotation marks omitted).  The court concluded that \xe2\x80\x9cpenalizing the [arresting] officer\xe2\x80\x9d for following binding appellate precedent would do nothing to \xe2\x80\x9cdete[r] \xe2\x80\xa6 Fourth Amendment violations.\xe2\x80\x9d  598 F.\xc2\xa03d, at 1265\xe2\x80\x931266 (bracketing and internal quotation marks omitted).  It therefore declined to apply the exclusionary rule and affirmed Davis\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  We granted certiorari.  562 U.

The error in such a case rests with the issuing magistrate, not the police officer, and \xe2\x80\x9cpunish[ing] the errors of judges\xe2\x80\x9d is not the office of the exclusionary rule.  <em>Id.</em>, at 916; see also <em>Massachusetts</em> v. <em>Sheppard</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/981/index.html">468 U.

In <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <em>supra</em>, the Court applied the good-faith exception in a case where the police reasonably relied on erroneous information concerning an arrest warrant in a database maintained by judicial employees.  <em>Id.</em>, at 14.

S., at 137, 144.</p>\n<p align="left">III</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The question in this case is whether to apply the exclusionary rule when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding judicial precedent.  At the time of the search at issue here, we had not yet decided <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Gant</em>, 556 U. S. ___, and the Eleventh Circuit had interpreted our decision in <em>New York</em> v. <em>Belton</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/453/454/index.html"></a><a href="/us/453/454/index.html">453 U. S. 454</a>, to establish a bright-line rule authorizing the search of a vehicle\xe2\x80\x99s passenger compartment incident to a recent occupant\xe2\x80\x99s arrest.  <em>Gonzalez</em>, 71 F. 3d, at 825.  The search incident to Davis\xe2\x80\x99s arrest in this case followed the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s <em>Gonzalez</em> precedent to the letter.  Although the search turned out to be unconstitutional under <em>Gant</em>, all agree that the officers\xe2\x80\x99 conduct was in strict compliance with then-binding Circuit law and was not culpable in any way.  See Brief for Petitioner 49 (\xe2\x80\x9csuppression\xe2\x80\x9d in this case would \xe2\x80\x9cimpl[y] no assignment of blame\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Under our exclusionary-rule precedents, this acknowledged absence of police culpability dooms Davis\xe2\x80\x99s claim.  Police practices trigger the harsh sanction of exclusion only when they are deliberate enough to yield \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningfu[l]\xe2\x80\x9d deterrence, and culpable enough to be \xe2\x80\x9cworth the price paid by the justice system.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Herring</em>, 555 U. S., at 144.  The conduct of the officers here was neither of these things.  The officers who conducted the search did not violate Davis\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment rights deliberately, recklessly, or with gross negligence.  <em>See ibid.</em>  Nor does this case involve any \xe2\x80\x9crecurring or systemic negligence\xe2\x80\x9d on the part of law enforcement.  <em>Ibid</em>.  The police acted in strict compliance with binding precedent, and their behavior was not wrongful.  Unless the exclusionary rule is to become a strict-liability regime, it can have no application in this case.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Indeed, in 27 years of practice under <em>Leon</em>\xe2\x80\x99s good-faith exception, we have \xe2\x80\x9cnever applied\xe2\x80\x9d the exclusionary rule to suppress evidence obtained as a result of nonculpable, innocent police conduct.  <em>Herring</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 144.  If the police in this case had reasonably relied on a warrant in conducting their search, see <em>Leon</em>, <em>supra</em>, or on an erroneous warrant record in a government database, <em>Herring</em>, <em>supra</em>, the exclusionary rule would not apply.  And if Congress or the Alabama Legislature had enacted a statute codifying the precise holding of the Eleventh Circuit\xe2\x80\x99s decision in <em>Gonzalez</em>,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">Footnote 4</a>] we would swiftly conclude that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]enalizing the officer for the legislature\xe2\x80\x99s error \xe2\x80\xa6 cannot logically contribute to the deterrence of Fourth Amendment violations.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Krull</em>, 480 U. S., at 350.  The same should be true of Davis\xe2\x80\x99s attempt here to \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[p]enaliz[e] the officer for the [appellate judges\xe2\x80\x99] error.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>ibid</em>.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0About all that exclusion would deter in this case is conscientious police work.  Responsible law-enforcement officers will take care to learn \xe2\x80\x9cwhat is required of them\xe2\x80\x9d under Fourth Amendment precedent and will conform their conduct to these rules.  <em>Hudson</em>, 547 U. S., at 599.  But by the same token, when binding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorizes</em> a particular police practice, well-trained officers will and should use that tool to fulfill their crime-detection and public-safety responsibilities.  An of-ficer who conducts a search in reliance on binding appellate precedent does no more than \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98ac[t] as a reasonable officer would and should act\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d under the circumstances.  <em>Leon</em>, 468 U. S., at 920 (quoting <em>Stone</em>, 428 U. S., at 539\xe2\x80\x93540 (White, J., dissenting)).  The deterrent effect of exclusion in such a case can only be to discourage the officer from \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98do[ing] his duty.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  468 U. S., at 920.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0That is not the kind of deterrence the exclusionary rule seeks to foster.  We have stated before, and we reaffirm today, that the harsh sanction of exclusion \xe2\x80\x9cshould not be applied to deter objectively reasonable law enforcement activity.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Id.,</em> at 919.  Evidence obtained during a search conducted in reasonable reliance on binding precedent is not subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p align="left">IV</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Justice Breyer\xe2\x80\x99s dissent and Davis argue that, although the police conduct in this case was in no way culpable, other considerations should prevent the good-faith exception from applying.  We are not persuaded.</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The principal argument of both the dissent and Davis is that the exclusionary rule\xe2\x80\x99s availability to enforce new Fourth Amendment precedent is a retroactivity issue, see <em>Griffith</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a> (1987), not a good-faith issue.  They contend that applying the good-faith exception where police have relied on overruled precedent effectively revives the discarded retroactivity regime of <em>Linkletter</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/index.html">381 U. S. 618</a> (1965).  See <em>post</em>, at 2\xe2\x80\x935.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0In <em>Linkletter</em>, we held that the retroactive effect of a new constitutional rule of criminal procedure should be determined on a case-by-case weighing of interests.  For each new rule, <em>Linkletter</em> required courts to consider a three-factor balancing test that looked to the \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the new rule, \xe2\x80\x9creliance\xe2\x80\x9d on the old rule by law enforcement and others, and the effect retroactivity would have \xe2\x80\x9con\nthe administration of justice.\xe2\x80\x9d  381 U. S., at 636.  After \xe2\x80\x9cweigh[ing] the merits and demerits in each case,\xe2\x80\x9d courts decided whether and to what extent a new rule should be given retroactive effect.  <em>Id.</em>, at 629.  In <em>Linkletter</em> itself, the balance of interests prompted this Court to conclude that <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a>\xe2\x80\x94which incorporated the exclusionary rule against the States\xe2\x80\x94should not apply retroactively to cases already final on direct review.  381 U. S., at 639\xe2\x80\x93640.  The next year, we extended <em>Linkletter</em> to retroactivity determinations in cases on direct review.  See <em>Johnson</em> v. <em>New Jersey</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/719/index.html">384 U. S. 719</a>, 733 (1966) (holding that <em>Miranda </em>v. <em>Arizona</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/384/436/index.html">384 U. S. 436</a> (1966), and <em>Escobedo</em> v. <em>Illinois</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/378/478/index.html">378 U. S. 478</a> (1964), applied retroactively only to trials commenced after the decisions were released).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Over time, <em>Linkletter</em> proved difficult to apply in a consistent, coherent way.  Individual applications of the standard \xe2\x80\x9cproduced strikingly divergent results,\xe2\x80\x9d see <em>Dan-forth</em> v. <em>Minnesota</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/264/index.html">552 U. S. 264</a>, 273 (2008), that\nmany saw as \xe2\x80\x9cincompatible\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cinconsistent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Desist</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/index.html">394 U. S. 244</a>, 258 (1969) (Harlan, J., dissenting).  Justice Harlan in particular, who had endorsed the <em>Linkletter</em> standard early on, offered a strong critique in which he argued that \xe2\x80\x9cbasic judicial\xe2\x80\x9d norms required full retroactive application of new rules to all cases still subject to direct review.  394 U. S., at 258\xe2\x80\x93259; see also <em>Mackey</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/667/index.html">401 U. S. 667</a>, 675\xe2\x80\x93702 (1971) (Harlan, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  Eventually, and after more than 20 years of toil under <em>Linkletter</em>, the Court adopted Justice Harlan\xe2\x80\x99s view and held that newly announced rules of constitutional criminal procedure must apply \xe2\x80\x9cretroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griffith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 328.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent and Davis argue that applying the good-faith exception in this case is \xe2\x80\x9cincompatible\xe2\x80\x9d with our retroactivity precedent under <em>Griffith</em>.  See <em>post</em>, at 2; Reply Brief for Petitioner 3\xe2\x80\x937.  We think this argument conflates what are two distinct doctrines.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Our retroactivity jurisprudence is concerned with whether, as a categorical matter, a new rule is available on direct review as a <em>potential</em> ground for relief.  Retroactive application under <em>Griffith</em> lifts what would otherwise be a categorical bar to obtaining redress for the government\xe2\x80\x99s violation of a newly announced constitutional rule.  See <em>Danforth</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 271, n.\xc2\xa05 (noting that it may \xe2\x80\x9cmake more sense to speak in terms of the \xe2\x80\x98redressability\xe2\x80\x99 of violations of new rules, rather than the \xe2\x80\x98retroactivity\xe2\x80\x99 of such new rules\xe2\x80\x9d).  Retroactive application does not, however, determine what \xe2\x80\x9cappropriate remedy\xe2\x80\x9d (if any) the defendant should obtain.  See <em>Powell</em> v. <em>Nevada</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/511/79/index.html">511 U. S. 79</a>, 84 (1994) (noting that it \xe2\x80\x9cdoes not necessarily follow\xe2\x80\x9d from retroactive application of a new rule that the defendant will \xe2\x80\x9cgain \xe2\x80\xa6 relief\xe2\x80\x9d).  Remedy is a separate, analytically distinct issue.  Cf. <em>American Trucking Assns., Inc.</em> v. <em>Smith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/496/167/index.html">496 U. S. 167</a>, 189 (1990) (plurality opinion) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Court has never equated its retroactivity principles with remedial principles\xe2\x80\x9d).  As a result, the retroactive application of a new rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law <em>raises</em> the question whether a suppression remedy applies; it does not answer that question.  See <em>Leon</em>, 468 U. S., at 906 (\xe2\x80\x9cWhether the exclusionary sanction is appropriately imposed in a particular case \xe2\x80\xa6 is \xe2\x80\x98an issue separate from the question whether the Fourth Amendment rights of the party seeking to invoke the rule were violated by police conduct\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0When this Court announced its decision in <em>Gant</em>, Davis\xe2\x80\x99s conviction had not yet become final on direct review.  <em>Gant</em> therefore applies retroactively to this case.  Davis may invoke its newly announced rule of substantive Fourth Amendment law as a basis for seeking relief.  See <em>Griffith</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 326, 328.  The question, then, becomes one of remedy, and on that issue Davis seeks application of the exclusionary rule.  But exclusion of evidence does not automatically follow from the fact that a Fourth Amendment violation occurred.  See <em>Evans</em>, 514 U. S., at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.  The remedy is subject to exceptions<em> </em>and applies only where its \xe2\x80\x9cpurpose is effectively advanced.\xe2\x80\x9d<em>  Krull</em>, 480 U. S., at 347.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent and Davis recognize that at least some of the established exceptions to the exclusionary rule limit its availability in cases involving new Fourth Amendment rules.  Suppression would thus be inappropriate, the dissent and Davis acknowledge, if the inevitable-discovery exception were applicable in this case.  See <em>post</em>, at 3; Reply Brief for Petitioner 22 (\xe2\x80\x9cDoctrines such as inevitable discovery, independent source, attenuated basis, [and] standing \xe2\x80\xa6 sharply limit the impact of newly-announced rules\xe2\x80\x9d).  The good-faith exception, however, is no less an established limit on the <em>remedy </em>of exclusion than is inevitable discovery.  Its application here neither contravenes <em>Griffith</em> nor denies retroactive effect to <em>Gant</em>.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">Footnote 5</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is true that, under the old retroactivity regime of <em>Linkletter</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decisions on the \xe2\x80\x9cretroactivity prob-lem in the context of the exclusionary rule\xe2\x80\x9d did take\ninto account whether \xe2\x80\x9claw enforcement officers reasonably believed in good faith\xe2\x80\x9d that their conduct was in compliance with governing law.  <em>Peltier</em>, 422 U. S., at 535\xe2\x80\x93537.  As a matter of retroactivity analysis, that approach is no longer applicable.  See <em>Griffith</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html"></a><a href="/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>.  It does not follow, however, that reliance on binding precedent is irrelevant in applying the good-faith exception to the exclusionary rule.  When this Court adopted the good-faith exception in <em>Leon</em>, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s opinion explicitly relied on <em>Peltier </em>and imported its reasoning into the good-faith inquiry.  See 468 U. S., at 918\xe2\x80\x93919.  That reasonable reliance by police was once a factor in our retroactivity cases does not make it any less relevant under our <em>Leon </em>line of cases.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">Footnote 6</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis also contends that applying the good-faith ex-ception to searches conducted in reliance on binding pre-cedent will stunt the development of Fourth Amendment law.  With no possibility of suppression, criminal defendants will have no incentive, Davis maintains, to request that courts overrule precedent.[<a href="#F7" name="T7">Footnote 7</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">1</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0This argument is difficult to reconcile with our modern understanding of the role of the exclusionary rule.  We have never held that facilitating the overruling of precedent is a relevant consideration in an exclusionary-rule case.  Rather, we have said time and again that the <em>sole</em> purpose of the exclusionary rule is to deter misconduct by law enforcement.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Sheppard</em>, 468 U. S., at 990 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98adopted to deter unlawful searches by police\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>Evans</em>, <em>supra,</em> at 14 (\xe2\x80\x9chistorically designed as a means of deterring police misconduct\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0We have also repeatedly rejected efforts to expand the focus of the exclusionary rule beyond deterrence of culpable police conduct.  In <em>Leon,</em> for example, we made clear that \xe2\x80\x9cthe exclusionary rule is designed to deter police misconduct rather than to punish the errors of judges.\xe2\x80\x9d  468 U. S., at 916; see <em>id</em>., at 918 (\xe2\x80\x9cIf exclusion of evidence obtained pursuant to a subsequently invalidated warrant is to have any deterrent effect \xe2\x80\xa6 it must alter the behavior of individual law enforcement officers or the policies of their departments\xe2\x80\x9d).  <em>Krull</em> too noted that \xe2\x80\x9clegislators, like judicial officers, are not the focus\xe2\x80\x9d of the exclusionary rule. 480 U. S., at 350.  And in<em> Evans</em>, we said that the exclusionary rule was aimed at deterring \xe2\x80\x9cpolice misconduct, not mistakes by court employees.\xe2\x80\x9d  514 U. S., at 14.  These cases do not suggest that the exclusionary rule should be modified to serve a purpose other than deterrence of culpable law-enforcement conduct.</p>\n<p align="left">2</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0And in any event, applying the good-faith exception in this context will not prevent judicial reconsideration of prior Fourth Amendment precedents.  In most instances, as in this case, the precedent sought to be challenged will be a decision of a Federal Court of Appeals or State Supreme Court.  But a good-faith exception for objectively reasonable reliance on binding precedent will not prevent review and correction of such decisions.  This Court reviews criminal convictions from 12 Federal Courts of Appeals, 50 state courts of last resort, and the District of Columbia Court of Appeals.  If one or even many of these courts uphold a particular type of search or seizure, defendants in jurisdictions in which the question remains open will still have an undiminished incentive to litigate the issue.  This Court can then grant certiorari, and the de-velopment of Fourth Amendment law will in no way be stunted.[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Davis argues that Fourth Amendment precedents of <em>this </em>Court will be effectively insulated from challenge under a good-faith exception for reliance on appellate precedent.  But this argument is overblown.  For one thing, it is important to keep in mind that this argument applies to an exceedingly small set of cases. Decisions overruling this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment precedents are rare.  Indeed, it has been more than 40 years since the Court last handed down a decision of the type to which Davis refers.  <em>Chimel</em> v. <em>California</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/395/752/index.html"></a><a href="/us/395/752/index.html">395 U.

And even in those cases, Davis points out that no fewer than eight separate doctrines may preclude a defendant who successfully challenges an existing precedent from getting any relief.  Brief for Petitioner 50.  Moreover, as a practical matter, defense counsel in many cases will test this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment precedents in the same way that <em>Belton</em> was tested in <em>Gant</em>\xe2\x80\x94by arguing that the precedent is distinguishable.  See Brief for Respondent in <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Gant</em>, O.\xc2\xa0T. 2008, No. 07\xe2\x80\x93542, pp. 22\xe2\x80\x9329.[<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At most, Davis\xe2\x80\x99s argument might suggest that\xe2\x80\x94to prevent Fourth Amendment law from becoming ossified\xe2\x80\x94the petitioner in a case that results in the overruling of one of this Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment precedents should be given the benefit of the victory by permitting the suppression of evidence in that one case.  Such a result would undoubtedly be a windfall to this one random litigant.  But the exclusionary rule is \xe2\x80\x9cnot a personal constitutional right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Stone</em>, 428 U. S., at 486.  It is a \xe2\x80\x9cjudicially created\xe2\x80\x9d sanction, <em>Calandra</em>, 414 U. S., at 348, specifically designed as a \xe2\x80\x9cwindfall\xe2\x80\x9d remedy to deter future Fourth Amendment violations.  See <em>Stone</em>, <em>supra</em>, at 490.  The good-faith exception is a judicially created exception to this judicially created rule.  Therefore, in a future case, we could, if necessary, recognize a limited exception to the good-faith exception for a defendant who obtains a judgment over-ruling one of our Fourth Amendment prece-\ndents.  Cf. Friendly, The Bill of Rights as a Code of\nCriminal Procedure, 53 Cal. L. Rev. 929, 952\xe2\x80\x93953 (1965) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he same authority that empowered the Court to supplement the amendment by the exclusionary rule a hundred and twenty-five years after its adoption, likewise allows it to modify that rule as the lessons of experience may teach\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks and footnotes\nomitted)).[<a href="#F10" name="T10">Footnote 10</a>]</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But this is not such a case.  Davis did not secure a decision overturning a Supreme Court precedent; the police in his case reasonably relied on binding Circuit precedent.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Gonzalez</em>, 71 F. 3d 819.  That sort of blameless police conduct, we hold, comes within the good-faith exception and is not properly subject to the exclusionary rule.</p>\n<p align="left">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0It is one thing for the criminal \xe2\x80\x9cto go free because the constable has blundered.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>People</em> v. <em>Defore</em>, 242 N.\xc2\xa0Y. 13, 21, 150 N.\xc2\xa0E. 585, 587 (1926) (Cardozo, J.).  It is quite another to set the criminal free because the constable has scrupulously adhered to governing law.  Excluding evidence in such cases deters no police misconduct and imposes substantial social costs.  We therefore hold that when the police conduct a search in objectively reasonable reliance on binding appellate precedent, the exclusionary rule does not apply.

And as a practical matter, the argument is also overstated.  In many instances, as in <em>Gant</em>, see 556 U.

Accordingly, we have held, application of the exclusionary rule is unwarranted when it \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98does not result in appreciable deterrence.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html">514 U.

In the circumstances of this case, where \xe2\x80\x9cbinding appellate precedent specifically <em>authorize[d]</em> a particular police practice,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 11\xe2\x80\x94in accord with \nthe holdings of nearly every other court in the country\xe2\x80\x94application of the exclusionary rule cannot reasonably \nbe expected to yield appreciable deterrence.

As we previously recognized in deciding whether to apply a Fourth Amendment holding retroactively, when police decide to conduct a search or seizure in the absence of case law (or other authority) specifically sanctioning such action, exclusion of the evidence obtained may deter Fourth Amendment violations:</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cIf, as the Government argues, all rulings resolving unsettled Fourth Amendment questions should be nonretroactive, then, in close cases, law enforcement officials would have little incentive to err on the side of constitutional behavior.  Official awareness of the dubious constitutionality of a practice would be counterbalanced by official certainty that, so long as the Fourth Amendment law in the area remained un-settled, evidence obtained through the questionable practice would be excluded only in the one case \ndefinitively resolving the unsettled question.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>United States</em> v. <em>Johnson</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/457/537/index.html">457 U.

Whether exclusion would deter Fourth Amendment violations where appellate precedent does not specifically authorize a certain practice and, if so, whether the benefits of exclusion would outweigh its costs are questions unanswered by our previous decisions.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The dissent suggests that today\xe2\x80\x99s decision essentially answers those questions, noting that an officer who conducts a search in the face of unsettled precedent \xe2\x80\x9cis no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \xe2\x80\x98binding precedent.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Post</em>, at 7 (opinion of Breyer, J.).  The Court does not address this issue.  In my view, whether an officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct can be characterized as \xe2\x80\x9cculpable\xe2\x80\x9d is not itself dispositive.  We have never refused to apply the exclusionary rule where its application would appreciably deter Fourth Amendment violations on the mere ground that the officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct could be characterized as nonculpable.  Rather, an officer\xe2\x80\x99s culpability is relevant because it may inform the overarching inquiry whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence.  See <em>ante</em>, at 8 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe basic insight of the <em>Leon</em> line of cases is that the deterrence benefits of exclusion var[y] with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue\xe2\x80\x9d (internal quotation marks omitted; alteration in original)); see also, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>Herring</em>, 555 U. S., at 143 (\xe2\x80\x9cThe extent to which the exclusionary rule is justified by these deterrence principles varies with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct\xe2\x80\x9d); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U.

Whatever we have said about culpability, the ultimate questions have always been, one, whether exclusion would result in appreciable deterrence and, two, whether the benefits of exclusion outweigh its costs.  See, <em>e.g.</em>, <em>ante</em>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937; <em>Herring</em>, 555 U. S., at 141; <em>Krull</em>, 480 U.

Because <em>Gant </em>represents a \xe2\x80\x9cshift\xe2\x80\x9d in the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence, <em>ante</em>,<em> </em>at 1, we must decide <em>whether</em> and <em>how</em> <em>Gant\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>new rule applies here.</p>\n<p align="left">I</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0I agree with the Court about <em>whether Gant</em>\xe2\x80\x99s new rule applies.  It does apply.  Between 1965, when the Court decided <em>Linkletter</em> v. <em>Walker</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/381/618/index.html">381 U. S. 618</a>, and 1987, when it decided <em>Griffith</em> v. <em>Kentucky</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/479/314/index.html">479 U. S. 314</a>, that conclusion would have been more difficult to reach.  Under <em>Linkletter</em>,<em> </em>the Court determined a new rule\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity by looking to several different factors, including whether the new rule represented a \xe2\x80\x9cclear break\xe2\x80\x9d with the past and the degree of \xe2\x80\x9creliance by law enforcement authorities on the old standards.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Desist</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/394/244/index.html">394 U. S. 244</a>, 248\xe2\x80\x93249 (1969) (internal quotation marks omitted) (also citing \xe2\x80\x9cthe purpose to be served by the new standards\xe2\x80\x9d \nand \xe2\x80\x9cthe effect on the administration of justice\xe2\x80\x9d as factors (internal quotation marks omitted)).  And the Court would often not apply the new rule to identical cases still pending on appeal.  See <em>ibid.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0After 22 years of struggling with its Linkletter </em>approach, however, the Court decided in <em>Griffith </em>that <em>Linkletter \n</em>had proved unfair and unworkable.  It then substituted a clearer approach, stating that \xe2\x80\x9ca new rule for the conduct of criminal prosecutions is to be applied retroactively to all cases, state or federal, pending on direct review or not yet final, with no exception for cases in which the new rule constitutes a \xe2\x80\x98clear break\xe2\x80\x99 with the past.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 U. S., at 328.  The Court today, following <em>Griffith</em>, concludes that <em>Gant\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>new rule applies here. And to that extent I agree with its decision.</p>\n<p align="left">II</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The Court goes on, however, to decide <em>how Gant\xe2\x80\x99</em>s<em> </em>new rule will apply.  And here it adds a fatal twist.  While conceding that, like the search in <em>Gant, </em>this search violated the Fourth Amendment, it holds that, unlike Gant<em>, </em>this defendant is not entitled to a remedy.  That is be-cause the Court finds a new \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception which prevents application of the normal remedy for a Fourth Amendment violation, namely, suppression of the illegally seized evidence.  <em>Weeks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/index.html"></a><a href="/us/232/383/index.html">232 U. S. 383</a> (1914); <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a> (1961)<em>. </em> Leaving Davis with a right but not a remedy, the Court \xe2\x80\x9ckeep[s] the word of promise to our ear\xe2\x80\x9d but \xe2\x80\x9cbreak[s] it to our hope.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p align="left">A</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At this point I can no longer agree with the Court.  A new \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception and this Court\xe2\x80\x99s retroactivity decisions are incompatible.  For one thing, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s distinction between (1) retroactive application of a new rule and (2) availability of a remedy is highly artificial and runs counter to precedent.  To determine that a new rule is retroactive <em>is </em>to determine that, at least in the normal case, there is a remedy.  As we have previously said, the \xe2\x80\x9csource of a \xe2\x80\x98new rule\xe2\x80\x99 is the Constitution itself, not any judicial power to create new rules of law\xe2\x80\x9d; hence, \xe2\x80\x9c[w]hat we are actually determining when we assess the \xe2\x80\x98retroactivity\xe2\x80\x99 of a new rule is not the temporal scope of a newly announced right, but whether a violation of the right that occurred prior to the announcement of the new rule will entitle a criminal defendant to the relief sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Danforth</em> v. <em>Minnesota</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/552/264/index.html">552 U. S. 264</a>, 271 (2008).  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception (unlike, say, inevitable discovery, a remedial doctrine that applies only upon occasion) creates \xe2\x80\x9ca categorical bar to obtaining redress\xe2\x80\x9d in <em>every </em>case pending when a precedent is overturned.  <em>Ante</em>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314.</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0For another thing, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding re-creates the very problems that led the Court to abandon <em>Linkletter</em>\xe2\x80\x99s approach to retroactivity in favor of <em>Griffith</em>\xe2\x80\x99s<em>.</em>  One such problem concerns workability.  The Court says that its exception applies where there is \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively reasonable\xe2\x80\x9d police \xe2\x80\x9creliance on binding appellate precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 1, 19.  But to apply the term \xe2\x80\x9cbinding appellate precedent\xe2\x80\x9d often requires resolution of complex questions of degree.  Davis conceded that he faced binding anti-<em>Gant </em>precedent in the Eleventh Circuit.  But future litigants will be less forthcoming.  <em>Ante</em>, at 18.  Indeed, those litigants will now have to create distinctions to show that previous Circuit precedent was not \xe2\x80\x9cbinding\xe2\x80\x9d lest they find relief foreclosed even if they win their constitutional claim.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0At the same time, Fourth Amendment precedents frequently require courts to \xe2\x80\x9cslosh\xe2\x80\x9d their \xe2\x80\x9cway through the factbound morass of \xe2\x80\x98reasonableness.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Scott</em> v. <em>Harris</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/550/372/index.html">550 U. S. 372</a>, 383 (2007).  Suppose an officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct is consistent with the language of a Fourth Amendment rule that a court of appeals announced in a case with clearly distinguishable facts?  Suppose the case creating the rele-vant precedent did not directly announce any general \nrule but involved highly analogous facts?  What about a rule that all other jurisdictions, but not the defendant\xe2\x80\x99s jurisdiction, had previously accepted?  What rules can be developed for determining when, where, and how these different kinds of precedents do, or do not, count as relevant \xe2\x80\x9cbinding precedent\xe2\x80\x9d?  The <em>Linkletter-</em>like result is likely complex legal argument and police force confusion.  See <em>Williams</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/401/646/index.html">401 U. S. 646</a>, 676 (1971)<em> </em>(opinion of Harlan, J.) (describing trying to follow <em>Linkletter </em>decisions as \xe2\x80\x9calmost as difficult\xe2\x80\x9d as trying to follow \xe2\x80\x9cthe tracks made by a beast of prey in search of its intended victim\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Another such problem concerns fairness.  Today\xe2\x80\x99s holding, like that in <em>Linkletter</em>, \xe2\x80\x9cviolates basic norms of con-stitutional adjudication.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Griffith</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 322.  It treats the defendant in a case announcing a new rule one way while treating similarly situated defendants whose cases are pending on appeal in a different way.  See <em>ante</em>, at 18\xe2\x80\x9319.  Justice Harlan explained why this approach is wrong when he said:</p>\n<p align="left">\xe2\x80\x9cWe cannot release criminals from jail merely because we think one case is a particularly appropriate one [to announce a constitutional doctrine] \xe2\x80\xa6\xc2\xa0.  Simply fishing one case from the stream of appellate review, using it as a vehicle for pronouncing new constitutional standards, and then permitting a stream of similar cases subsequently to flow by unaffected by that new rule constitute an indefensible departure from [our ordinary] model of judicial review.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Williams</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 679<em>.</em></p><em>\n</em><p align="left"><em>\nAnd in Griffith</em>, the Court \xe2\x80\x9cembraced to a significant extent the comprehensive analysis presented by Justice Harlan.\xe2\x80\x9d  479 U. S., at 322.</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Of course, the Court may, as it suggests, avoid this un-fairness by refusing to apply the exclusionary rule even \nto the defendant in the very case in which it announces a \xe2\x80\x9cnew rule.\xe2\x80\x9d  But that approach would make matters worse.  What would then happen in the lower courts?  How would courts of appeals, for example, come to reconsider their prior decisions when other circuits\xe2\x80\x99 cases lead them to believe those decisions may be wrong?  Why would a defendant seek to overturn any such decision?  After all, if the (incorrect) circuit precedent is clear, then even if \nthe defendant wins (on the constitutional question), he loses (on relief).  See <em>Stovall</em> v. <em>Denno</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/388/293/index.html">388 U. S. 293</a>, 301 (1967).  To what extent then could this Court rely upon lower courts to work out Fourth Amendment differences among themselves\xe2\x80\x94through circuit reconsideration of a precedent that other circuits have criticized?  See <em>Ari-\nzona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html">514 U. S. 1</a>, 23, n.\xc2\xa01 (1995) (Ginsburg, J., dissenting).</p>\n<p align="left">B</p>\n<p align="left">\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0Perhaps more important, the Court\xe2\x80\x99s rationale for creating its new \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception threatens to undermine well-settled Fourth Amendment law.  The Court correctly says that pre-<em>Gant</em> Eleventh Circuit precedent had held that a <em>Gant-</em>type search was constitutional; hence the police conduct in this case, consistent with that precedent, was \xe2\x80\x9cinnocent.\xe2\x80\x9d  <em>Ante</em>, at 10.  But the Court then finds this fact sufficient to create a new \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception to the exclusionary rule.  It reasons that the \xe2\x80\x9csole purpose\xe2\x80\x9d of the exclusionary rule \xe2\x80\x9cis to deter future Fourth Amendment violations,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 6.  The \xe2\x80\x9cdeterrence benefits of exclusion vary with the culpability of the law enforcement conduct at issue,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ante</em>, at 8 (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).  Those benefits are sufficient to jus-\ntify exclusion where \xe2\x80\x9cpolice exhibit deliberate, reckless, \nor grossly negligent disregard for Fourth Amendment rights,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).  But those benefits do not justify exclusion where, as here, the police act with \xe2\x80\x9csimple, isolated negligence\xe2\x80\x9d or an \xe2\x80\x9cobjectively reasonable good-faith belief that their conduct is lawful,\xe2\x80\x9d <em>ibid. </em>(internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p align="left">\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0If the Court means what it says, what will happen to the exclusionary rule, a rule that the Court adopted nearly a century ago for federal courts, <em>Weeks</em> v. <em>United States</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/232/383/index.html"></a><a href="/us/232/383/index.html">232 U. S. 383</a><em>,</em> and made applicable to state courts a half century ago through the Fourteenth Amendment, <em>Mapp</em> v. <em>Ohio</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html"></a><a href="/us/367/643/index.html">367 U. S. 643</a>? <em> </em>The Court has thought of that rule not as punishment for the individual officer or as reparation for the individual defendant but more generally as \nan effective way to secure enforcement of the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s commands.  <em>Weeks</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 393 (without the exclusionary rule, the Fourth Amendment would be \xe2\x80\x9cof no value,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cmight as well be stricken from the Constitution\xe2\x80\x9d). <em> </em>This Court has deviated from the \xe2\x80\x9csuppression\xe2\x80\x9d norm in the name of \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d only a handful of times and in limited, atypical circumstances: where a magistrate has erroneously issued a warrant, <em>United States</em> v. <em>Leon</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/468/897/index.html">468 U. S. 897</a> (1984); where a database has erroneously informed police that they have a warrant, <em>Arizona</em> v. <em>Evans</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/514/1/index.html"></a><a href="/us/514/1/index.html">514 U.

S. 340</a> (1987).  See <em>Herring</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 142 (\xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception inaptly named).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0The fact that such exceptions are few and far between is understandable.  Defendants frequently move to suppress evidence on Fourth Amendment grounds.  In many, perhaps most, of these instances the police, uncertain of how the Fourth Amendment applied to the particular factual circumstances they faced, will have acted in objective good faith.  Yet, in a significant percentage of these instances, courts will find that the police were wrong.  And, unless the police conduct falls into one of the exceptions previously noted, courts have required the suppression of the evidence seized.  1 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure \xc2\xa71.3, pp.\xc2\xa0103\xe2\x80\x93104 (4th ed. 2004) (\xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception has not yet been applied to warrantless searches and seizures beyond the \xe2\x80\x9crather special situations\xe2\x80\x9d of <em>Evans</em>, <em>Herring</em>, and <em>Krull</em>).  See Valdes, Frequency and Success: An Empirical Study of Criminal Law Defenses, Federal Constitutional Evidentiary Claims, and Plea Negotiations, 153\nU. Pa. L. Rev. 1709, 1728 (2005) (suppression motions are filed in approximately 7% of criminal cases; approximately 12% of suppression motions are successful); LaFave, <em>supra, </em>at 64 (\xe2\x80\x9cSurely many more Fourth Amendment violations result from carelessness than from intentional constitutional violations\xe2\x80\x9d); Stewart, The Road to <em>Mapp v</em>. <em>Ohio</em> and Beyond: The Origins, Development and Future of the Exclusionary Rule in Search-and-Seizure Cases, 83 Colum. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 1365, 1389 (1983) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he vast majority of fourth amendment violations \xe2\x80\xa6 [are] motivated by commendable zeal, not condemnable malice\xe2\x80\x9d).</p>\n<p>\n\n\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0But an officer who conducts a search that he believes complies with the Constitution but which, it ultimately turns out, falls just outside the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s bounds is no more culpable than an officer who follows erroneous \xe2\x80\x9cbinding precedent.\xe2\x80\x9d  Nor is an officer more culpable where circuit precedent is simply suggestive rather than \xe2\x80\x9cbinding,\xe2\x80\x9d where it only describes how to treat roughly analogous instances, or where it just does not exist.  Thus, if the Court means what it now says, if it would place determinative weight upon the culpability of an individual officer\xe2\x80\x99s conduct, and if it would apply the exclusionary rule only where a Fourth Amendment violation was \xe2\x80\x9cdeliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent,\xe2\x80\x9d then the \xe2\x80\x9cgood faith\xe2\x80\x9d exception will swallow the exclusionary rule.  Indeed, our broad dicta in <em>Herring</em>\xe2\x80\x94dicta the Court repeats and expands upon today\xe2\x80\x94may already be leading lower courts in this direction.  See <em>United States</em> v. <em>Julius</em>, 610 F.\xc2\xa03d 60, 66\xe2\x80\x9367 (CA2 2010) (assuming warrantless search was unconstitutional and remanding for District Court to \xe2\x80\x9cperform the cost/benefit analysis required by <em>Herring</em>\xe2\x80\x9d and to consider \xe2\x80\x9cwhether the degree of police culpability in this case rose beyond mere \xe2\x80\xa6 negligence\xe2\x80\x9d before ordering suppression); <em>United States</em> v. <em>Master</em>, 614 F.\xc2\xa03d 236, 243 (CA6 2010) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he <em>Herring</em> Court\xe2\x80\x99s emphasis seems weighed more toward preserving evidence for use in obtaining convictions, even if illegally seized \xe2\x80\xa6 unless the officers engage in \xe2\x80\x98deliberate, reckless, or grossly negligent conduct\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (quoting <em>Herring</em>, <em>supra, </em>at 144)).

See Valdes, <em>supra, </em>at<em> </em>1728.  And since the exclusionary rule is often the only sanction available for a Fourth Amendment violation, the Fourth Amendment would no longer protect ordinary Americans from \xe2\x80\x9cunreasonable searches and seizures.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <em>Wolf</em> v. <em>Colorado</em>, <a href="/cases/federal/us/338/25/index.html">338 U.
