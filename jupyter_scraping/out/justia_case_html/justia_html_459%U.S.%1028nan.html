[<a href="#F1" name="T1">Footnote 1</a>] It is especially poor practice to do so when the basis for reversal involves a factual issue on which neither party adduced any evidence. Those considerations apply with added force when the judgment of the highest court of a sovereign state is being reviewed. [<a href="#F2" name="T2">Footnote 2</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1030">Page 459 U.S. 1028 , 1030</a></p><p> Each of these considerations applies to the additional question on which the Court has ordered reargument. Neither party gave the Circuit Court of DuPage County, the Appellate Court of Illinois, Second District, nor the Supreme Court of Illinois an opportunity to consider the question. Neither party offered any evidence concerning the state of mind of the magistrate when he issued the warrant, the state of mind of the officers who obtained the warrant, nor the state of mind of the officers who executed the warrant. In short, the new issue was not "fairly presented" to the state courts. Cf. Picard v. Connor, <a href="/cases/federal/us/404/270/case.html">404 U.S. 270</a> (1971). </p><h3><p> III </p></h3> <p> As a matter of power, the Court\'s action is subject to question. That question is serious whether one assumes that the Illinois courts decided the Fourth Amendment question correctly or incorrectly. </p><p> On the one hand, if it is assumed that the Supreme Court of Illinois correctly decided the only federal question that was presented to it,3 this Court has a duty to affirm its judgment. See New York ex rel. Cohn v. Graves, <a href="/cases/federal/us/300/308/case.html#317">300 U.S. 308, 317</a>, 469 </p><p><a class="page-number" name="1031">Page 459 U.S. 1028 , 1031</a></p><p> (1937). If the only federal question presented by a certiorari petition is unworthy of review, or does not identify a legitimate basis for reversal, this Court has no power to grant certiorari simply because it would like to address some other federal question. For neither Article III of the Constitution nor the jurisdictional statutes enacted by Congress vest this Court with any roving authority to decide federal questions that have not been properly raised in adversary litigation. </p><p> On the other hand, if it is assumed that the Supreme Court of Illinois has incorrectly decided the federal question that was presented to it, this Court has a duty to reverse its judgment. That duty could be performed by simply answering the question decided below, without reaching the additional question on which the Court orders reargument today. It is, of course, a settled canon of our constitutional jurisprudence that we do not decide constitutional questions unless it is necessary to do so to resolve an actual case or controversy. See e.g., Minnick v. California Dept. of Corrections, <a href="/cases/federal/us/452/105/case.html">452 U.S. 105</a>, 122-127, 2220-23, 68 L. Ed.2d 706 (1981). </p><p> Thus, however the Court resolves the merits of the federal question that has already been argued, the action it takes today sheds a distressing light on the Court\'s conception of the scope of its powers. Accordingly, I respectfully dissent. </p><h3>Footnotes</h3> <p><a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a> Of course, there is no impediment to presenting a new argument as an alternative basis for affirming the decision below. E.g., Hankerson v. North Carolina, <a href="/cases/federal/us/432/233/case.html">432 U.S. 233</a>, 240 n. 6, 2344 n. 6d 306 (1977). </p><p><a href="#T2" name="F2">Footnote 2</a> Writing for the Court in Cardinale v.
