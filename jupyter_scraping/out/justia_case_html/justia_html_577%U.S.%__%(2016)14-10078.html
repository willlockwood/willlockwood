In this case, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts upheld a Massachusetts law prohibiting the possession of stun guns after examining \xe2\x80\x9cwhether a stun gun is the type of weapon contemplated by Congress in 1789 as being protected by the\n \nSecond Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass. 774, 777, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d 688, 691 (2015).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court offered three explanations to support its holding that the\n \nSecond Amendment does not extend to stun guns.  First, the court explained that stun guns are not protected because they \xe2\x80\x9cwere not in common use at the time of the\n \nSecond Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E. 3d, at 693.

In so doing, the court concluded that stun guns are \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d because they are \xe2\x80\x9ca thoroughly modern invention.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693\xe2\x80\x93694.  By equating \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d with \xe2\x80\x9cin common use at the time of the\n \nSecond Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s enactment,\xe2\x80\x9d the court\xe2\x80\x99s second explanation is the same as the first; it is inconsistent with <i>Heller </i>for the same reason.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Finally, the court used \xe2\x80\x9ca contemporary lens\xe2\x80\x9d and found \xe2\x80\x9cnothing in the record to suggest that [stun guns] are readily adaptable to use in the military.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 694.  But <i>Heller</i> rejected the proposition \xe2\x80\x9cthat only those weapons useful in warfare are protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 624\xe2\x80\x93625.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For these three reasons, the explanation the Massachusetts court offered for upholding the law contradicts this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent.  Consequently, the petition for a writ of certiorari and the motion for leave to proceed <i>in forma pauperis</i> are granted.

She obtained multiple restraining orders against her abuser, but they proved futile.  So when a friend offered her a stun gun \xe2\x80\x9cfor self-defense against [her] former boy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 Mass. 774, 776, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d 688, 690 (2015), Caetano accepted the weapon.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is a good thing she did.  One night after leaving work, Caetano found her ex-boyfriend \xe2\x80\x9cwaiting for [her] outside.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 35.  He \xe2\x80\x9cstarted screaming\xe2\x80\x9d that she was \xe2\x80\x9cnot gonna [expletive deleted] work at this place\xe2\x80\x9d any more because she \xe2\x80\x9cshould be home with the kids\xe2\x80\x9d they had together.  <i>Ibid.</i>  Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s abuser towered over her by nearly a foot and outweighed her by close to 100 pounds.  But she didn\xe2\x80\x99t need physical strength to protect herself.  She stood her ground, displayed the stun gun, and announced: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not gonna take this anymore.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. I don\xe2\x80\x99t wanna have to [use the stun gun on] you, but if you don\xe2\x80\x99t leave me alone, I\xe2\x80\x99m gonna have to.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 35\xe2\x80\x9336.  The gambit worked.  The ex-boyfriend \xe2\x80\x9cgot scared and he left [her] alone.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i>at 36.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is settled that the\n \nSecond Amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms that applies against both the Federal Government and the States.  <i>District of Columbia</i> v. <i>Heller</i>,\n\n554 U.\xc2\xa0S. 570 (2008)\n; <i>McDonald</i> v. <i>Chicago</i>,\n\n561 U.\xc2\xa0S. 742 (2010)\n.  That right vindicates the \xe2\x80\x9cbasic right\xe2\x80\x9d of \xe2\x80\x9cindividual self-defense.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 767; see <i>Heller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 599, 628.  Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s encounter with her violent ex-boyfriend illustrates the connection between those fundamental rights: By arming herself, Caetano was able to protect against a physical threat that restraining orders had proved useless to prevent.  And, commendably, she did so by using a weapon that posed little, if any, danger of permanently harming either herself or the father of her children.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Under Massachusetts law, however, Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s mere possession of the stun gun that may have saved her life made her a criminal.  See Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\xc2\xa0140, \xc2\xa7131J (2014).  When police later discovered the weapon, she was arrested, tried, and convicted.  The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court affirmed the conviction, holding that a stun gun \xe2\x80\x9cis not the type of weapon that is eligible for\n \nSecond Amendment protection\xe2\x80\x9d because it was \xe2\x80\x9cnot in common use at the time of [the\n \nSecond Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s] enactment.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This reasoning defies our decision in <i>Heller</i>, which rejected as \xe2\x80\x9cbordering on the frivolous\xe2\x80\x9d the argument \xe2\x80\x9cthat only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the\n \nSecond Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 582.  The decision below also does a grave disservice to vulnerable individuals like Caetano who must defend themselves because the State will not.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The events leading to Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s prosecution occurred sometime after the confrontation between her and her ex-boyfriend.  In September 2011, police officers responded to a reported shoplifting at an Ashland, Massachusetts, supermarket.  The store\xe2\x80\x99s manager had detained a suspect, but he identified Caetano and another person in the parking lot as potential accomplices.  Police approached the two and obtained Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s consent to search her purse.  They found no evidence of shoplifting, but saw Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s stun gun.  Caetano explained to the officers that she had acquired the weapon to defend herself against a violent ex-boyfriend.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The officers believed Caetano, but they arrested her for violating Mass. Gen. Laws, ch.\xc2\xa0140, \xc2\xa7131J, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich bans entirely the possession of an electrical weapon,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 Mass., at 775, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 689.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]  When Caetano moved to dismiss the charge on\n \nSecond Amendment grounds, the trial court denied the motion.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A subsequent bench trial established the following undisputed facts.  The parties stipulated that Caetano possessed the stun gun and that the weapon fell within the statute\xe2\x80\x99s prohibition.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]  The Commonwealth also did not challenge Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s testimony that she possessed the weapon to defend herself against the violent ex-boyfriend.  Indeed, the prosecutor urged the court \xe2\x80\x9cto believe the defendant.\xe2\x80\x9d  Tr. 40.  The trial court nonetheless found Caetano guilty, and she appealed to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Supreme Judicial Court rejected Caetano\xe2\x80\x99s\n \nSecond Amendment claim, holding that \xe2\x80\x9ca stun gun is not the type of weapon that is eligible for\n \nSecond Amendment protection.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 775, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 689.  The court reasoned that stun guns are unprotected because they were \xe2\x80\x9cnot \xe2\x80\x98in common use at the time\xe2\x80\x99 of enactment of the\n \nSecond Amendment,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693 (quoting <i>Heller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 627), and because they fall within the \xe2\x80\x9ctraditional prohibition against carrying dangerous and unusual weapons,\xe2\x80\x9d 470 Mass.<i>,</i> at 779, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 692<i> </i>(citing <i>Heller</i>,<i> supra</i>, at 627).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Although the Supreme Judicial Court professed to apply <i>Heller</i>, each step of its analysis defied <i>Heller</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The state court repeatedly framed the question before it as whether a particular weapon was \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98in common use at the time\xe2\x80\x99 of enactment of the\n \nSecond Amendment.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693; see also<i> id.,</i> at 779, 780, 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 692, 693, 694.  In <i>Heller</i>, we emphatically rejected such a formulation.  We found the argument \xe2\x80\x9cthat only those arms in existence in the 18th century are protected by the\n \nSecond Amendment\xe2\x80\x9d not merely wrong, but \xe2\x80\x9cbordering on the frivolous.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 582.  Instead, we held that \xe2\x80\x9cthe\n \nSecond Amendment extends, prima facie, to all instruments that constitute bearable arms, <i>even those that were not in existence at the time of the founding</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (emphasis added).[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]  It is hard to imagine language speaking more directly to the point.  Yet the Supreme Judicial Court did not so much as mention it.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Instead, the court seized on language, originating in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Miller</i>,\n\n307 U.\xc2\xa0S. 174 (1939)\n, that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the sorts of weapons protected were those \xe2\x80\x9cin common use at the time.\xe2\x80\x9d\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 778, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 692 (quoting <i>Heller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 627, in turn quoting <i>Miller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 179).  That quotation does not mean, as the court below thought, that only weapons popular in 1789 are covered by the\n \nSecond Amendment.  It simply reflects the reality that the founding-era militia consisted of citizens \xe2\x80\x9cwho would bring the sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home to militia duty,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Heller</i>, 554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 627, and that the\n \nSecond Amendment accordingly guarantees the right to carry weapons \xe2\x80\x9ctypically possessed by law-abiding citizens for lawful purposes,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>id.,</i> at 625.  While stun guns were not in existence at the end of the 18th century, the same is true for the weapons most commonly used today for self-defense, namely, revolvers and semiautomatic pistols.  Revolvers were virtually unknown until well into the 19th century,[<a href="#F4" name="T4">4</a>] and semiautomatic pistols were not invented until near the end of that century.[<a href="#F5" name="T5">5</a>]  Electronic stun guns are no more exempt from the\n \nSecond Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protections, simply because they were unknown to the First Congress, than electronic communications are exempt from the\n \nFirst Amendment, or electronic imaging devices are exempt from the\n \nFourth Amendment.  <i>Id.,</i> at 582 (citing <i>Reno</i> v. <i>American Civil Liberties Union</i>,\n\n521 U.\xc2\xa0S. 844,\n849 (1997)\n, and <i>Kyllo</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n533 U.\xc2\xa0S. 27\n\xe2\x80\x9336 (2001)).  As <i>Heller </i>aptly put it: \xe2\x80\x9cWe do not interpret constitutional rights that way.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 582.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Supreme Judicial Court\xe2\x80\x99s holding that stun guns may be banned as \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous and unusual weapons\xe2\x80\x9d fares no better.  As the <i>per curiam</i> opinion recognizes, this is a conjunctive test: A weapon may not be banned unless it is <i>both </i>dangerous <i>and </i>unusual.  Because the Court rejects the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that stun guns are \xe2\x80\x9cunusual,\xe2\x80\x9d it does not need to consider the lower court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that they are also \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d  See <i>ante</i>, at 1\xe2\x80\x932.  But make no mistake\xe2\x80\x94the decision below gravely erred on both grounds.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">1</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">As to \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous,\xe2\x80\x9d the court below held that a weapon is \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous per\xc2\xa0se\xe2\x80\x9d if it is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98designed and constructed to produce death or great bodily harm\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98for the purpose of bodily assault or defense.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 779, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 692 (quoting <i>Commonwealth </i>v. <i>Appleby</i>, 380 Mass. 296, 303, 402 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d 1051, 1056 (1980)).  That test may be appropriate for applying statutes criminalizing assault with a dangerous weapon.  See <i>ibid.</i>, 402 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa02d, at 1056.  But it cannot be used to identify arms that fall outside the\n \nSecond Amendment.  First, the relative dangerousness of a weapon is irrelevant when the weapon belongs to a class of arms commonly used for lawful purposes.  See <i>Heller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 627 (contrasting \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98dangerous and unusual weapons\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d that may be banned with protected \xe2\x80\x9cweapons .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. \xe2\x80\x98in common use at the time\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d).  Second, even in cases where dangerousness might be relevant, the Supreme Judicial Court\xe2\x80\x99s test sweeps far too broadly.  <i>Heller</i> defined the \xe2\x80\x9cArms\xe2\x80\x9d <i>covered by</i> the\n \nSecond Amendment to include \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98any thing that a man wears for his defence, or takes into his hands, or useth in wrath to cast at or strike another.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 581.  Under the decision below, however, virtually every<i> </i>covered arm would qualify as \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Were there any doubt on this point, one need only look at the court\xe2\x80\x99s first example of \xe2\x80\x9cdangerous per se\xe2\x80\x9d weapons: \xe2\x80\x9cfirearms.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 779, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 692.  If <i>Heller </i>tells us anything, it is that firearms cannot be categorically prohibited just because they are dangerous.  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 636.  <i>A\xc2\xa0fortiori</i>, stun guns that the Commonwealth\xe2\x80\x99s own witness described as \xe2\x80\x9cnon-lethal force,\xe2\x80\x9d Tr. 27, cannot be banned on that basis.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">2</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The Supreme Judicial Court\xe2\x80\x99s conclusion that stun guns are \xe2\x80\x9cunusual\xe2\x80\x9d rested largely on its premise that one must ask whether a weapon was commonly used in 1789.  See 470 Mass., at 780\xe2\x80\x93781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693\xe2\x80\x93694.  As already discussed, that is simply wrong.  See <i>supra,</i> at 4\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The court also opined that a weapon\xe2\x80\x99s unusualness depends on whether \xe2\x80\x9cit is a weapon of warfare to be used by the militia.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 780, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693.  It asserted that we followed such an approach in <i>Miller </i>and \xe2\x80\x9capproved its use in <i>Heller</i>.\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 780, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 693.  But <i>Heller </i>actually said that it would be a \xe2\x80\x9cstartling reading\xe2\x80\x9d of <i>Miller </i>to conclude that \xe2\x80\x9conly those weapons useful in warfare are protected.\xe2\x80\x9d  554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 624.  Instead, <i>Miller </i>and <i>Heller </i>recognized that militia members traditionally reported for duty carrying \xe2\x80\x9cthe sorts of lawful weapons that they possessed at home,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the\n \nSecond Amendment therefore protects such weapons as a class, regardless of any particular weapon\xe2\x80\x99s suitability for military use.  554 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 627; see <i>id.,</i> at 624\xe2\x80\x93625.  Indeed, <i>Heller</i> acknowledged that advancements in military technology might render many commonly owned weapons ineffective in warfare.  <i>Id.,</i> at 627\xe2\x80\x93628.  But such \xe2\x80\x9cmodern developments .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. cannot change our interpretation of the right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In any event, the Supreme Judicial Court\xe2\x80\x99s assumption that stun guns are unsuited for militia or military use is untenable.  Section 131J allows law enforcement and correctional officers to carry stun guns and Tasers, presumably for such purposes as nonlethal crowd control.

The Supreme Judicial Court offered only a cursory discussion of that question, noting that the \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98number of Tasers and stun guns is dwarfed by the number of firearms.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  470 Mass., at 781, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E. 3d, at 693.  This observation may be true, but it is beside the point.  Otherwise, a State would be free to ban <i>all </i>weapons <i>except </i>handguns, because \xe2\x80\x9chandguns are the most popular weapon chosen by Americans for self-defense in the home.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Heller</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 629.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The more relevant statistic is that \xe2\x80\x9c[h]undreds of thousands of Tasers and stun guns have been sold to private citizens,\xe2\x80\x9d who it appears may lawfully possess them in 45 States.  <i>People </i>v. <i>Yanna</i>, 297 Mich. App. 137, 144, 824 N.\xc2\xa0W.\xc2\xa02d 241, 245 (2012) (holding Michigan stun gun ban unconstitutional); see Volokh, Nonlethal Self-Defense, (Almost Entirely) Nonlethal Weapons, and the Rights To Keep and Bear Arms and Defend Life, 62 Stan.

While less popular than handguns, stun guns are widely owned and accepted as a legitimate means of self-defense across the country.  Massachusetts\xe2\x80\x99 categorical ban of such weapons therefore violates the\n \nSecond Amendment.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">The lower court\xe2\x80\x99s ill treatment of <i>Heller </i>cannot stand.  The reasoning of the Massachusetts court poses a grave threat to the fundamental right of self-defense.  The Supreme Judicial Court suggested that Caetano could have simply gotten a firearm to defend herself.  470 Mass., at 783, 26 N.\xc2\xa0E.\xc2\xa03d, at 695.  But the right to bear other weapons is \xe2\x80\x9cno answer\xe2\x80\x9d to a ban on the possession of protected arms.  <i>Heller</i>,<i> </i>554 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 629.  Moreover, a weapon is an effective means of self-defense only if one is prepared to use it, and it is presumptuous to tell Caetano she should have been ready to shoot the father of her two young children if she wanted to protect herself.  Courts should not be in the business of demanding that citizens use <i>more </i>force for self-defense than they are comfortable wielding.[<a href="#F6" name="T6">6</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Countless people may have reservations about using deadly force, whether for moral, religious, or emotional reasons\xe2\x80\x94or simply out of fear of killing the wrong person.  See Brief for Arming Women Against Rape &amp; Endangerment as <i>Amicus Curiae</i> 4\xe2\x80\x935.  \xe2\x80\x9cSelf-defense,\xe2\x80\x9d however, \xe2\x80\x9cis a basic right.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>McDonald</i>, 561 U.\xc2\xa0S.<i>,</i> at 767.  I am not prepared to say that a State may force an individual to choose between exercising that right and following her conscience, at least where both can be accommodated by a weapon already in widespread use across the Nation.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*\xe2\x80\x83\xe2\x80\x83*</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">A State\xe2\x80\x99s most basic responsibility is to keep its people safe.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts was either unable or unwilling to do what was necessary to protect Jaime Caetano, so she was forced to protect herself.  To make matters worse, the Commonwealth chose to deploy its prosecutorial resources to prosecute and convict her of a criminal offense for arming herself with a nonlethal weapon that may well have saved her life.  The Supreme Judicial Court then affirmed her conviction on the flimsiest of grounds.  This Court\xe2\x80\x99s grudging <i>per curiam</i> now sends the case back to that same court.  And the consequences for Caetano may prove more tragic still, as her conviction likely bars her from ever bearing arms for self-defense.  See Pet. for Cert. 14.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the fundamental right of self-defense does not protect Caetano, then the safety of all Americans is left to the mercy of state authorities who may be more concerned about disarming the people than about keeping them safe.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref">\n<a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a>\n</span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\n\t\t\xc2\xa0Specifically, the statute prohibits the possession of any \xe2\x80\x9cportable device or weapon from which an electrical current, impulse, wave or beam may be directed, which current, impulse, wave or beam is designed to incapacitate temporarily, injure or kill.\xe2\x80\x9d  Mass.
