Officer Rhodes discovered photographs on Collins\xe2\x80\x99 Facebook profile of an orange and black motorcycle parked in the driveway of a house, drove to the house, and parked on the street.  From there, he could see what appeared to be the motorcycle under a white tarp parked in the same location as the motorcycle in the photograph.  Without a search warrant, Office Rhodes walked to the top of the driveway, removed the tarp, confirmed that the motorcycle was stolen by running the license plate and vehicle identification numbers, took a photograph of the uncovered motorcycle, replaced the tarp, and returned to his car to wait for Collins.  When Collins returned, Officer Rhodes arrested him.  The trial court denied Collins\xe2\x80\x99 motion to suppress the evidence on the ground that Officer Rhodes violated the\n \nFourth Amendment when he trespassed on the house\xe2\x80\x99s curtilage to conduct a search, and Collins was convicted of receiving stolen property.  The Virginia Court of Appeals affirmed.  The State Supreme Court also affirmed, holding that the warrantless search was justified under the\n \nFourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s automobile exception. </p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:\xc2\xa0The automobile exception does not permit the warrantless entry of a home or its curtilage in order to search a vehicle therein.

In announcing each of the automobile exception\xe2\x80\x99s justifications\xe2\x80\x94<i>i.e., </i>the \xe2\x80\x9cready mobility of the automobile\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cthe pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public highways,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>California</i> v. <i>Carney,</i>\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386, 390, 392\xe2\x80\x94the Court emphasized that the rationales applied only to automobiles and not to houses, and therefore supported their different treatment as a constitutional matter.  When these justifications are present, officers may search an automobile without a warrant so long as they have probable cause.  Curtilage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe area \xe2\x80\x98immediately surrounding and associated with the home\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94is considered \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98part of the home itself for\n \nFourth Amendment purposes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Jardines, </i>\n\n569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 6.  Thus, when an officer physically intrudes on the curtilage to gather evidence, a\n \nFourth Amendment search has occurred and is presumptively unreasonable absent a warrant.  Pp.\xc2\xa03\xe2\x80\x936.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(b)\xc2\xa0As an initial matter, the part of the driveway where Collins\xe2\x80\x99 motorcycle was parked and subsequently searched is curtilage.  When Officer Rhodes searched the motorcycle, it was parked inside a partially enclosed top portion of the driveway that abuts the house.  Just like the front porch, side garden, or area \xe2\x80\x9coutside the front window,\xe2\x80\x9d that enclosure constitutes \xe2\x80\x9can area adjacent to the home and \xe2\x80\x98to which the activity of home life extends.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jardines</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 6, 7.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">Because the scope of the automobile exception extends no further than the automobile itself, it did not justify Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99 invasion of the curtilage.  Nothing in this Court\xe2\x80\x99s case law suggests that the automobile exception gives an officer the right to enter a home or its curtilage to access a vehicle without a warrant.  Such an expansion would both undervalue the core\n \nFourth Amendment protection afforded to the home and its curtilage and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98untether\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the exception \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98from the justifications underlying\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it.  <i>Riley </i>v.<i> California,</i> 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___.  This Court has similarly declined to expand the scope of other exceptions to the warrant requirement.  Thus, just as an officer must have a lawful right of access to any contraband he discovers in plain view in order to seize it without a warrant\xe2\x80\x94see <i>Horton</i> v. <i>California,</i>\n\n496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 136\xe2\x80\x93137\xe2\x80\x94and just as an officer must have a lawful right of access in order to arrest a person in his home\xe2\x80\x94see <i>Payton</i> v. <i>New York,</i>\n\n445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573, 587\xe2\x80\x93590\xe2\x80\x94so, too, an officer must have a lawful right of access to a vehicle in order to search it pursuant to the automobile exception.  To allow otherwise would unmoor the exception from its justifications, render hollow the core\n \nFourth Amendment protection the Constitution extends to the house and its curtilage, and transform what was meant to be an exception into a tool with far broader application.  Pp.\xc2\xa06\xe2\x80\x9311.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">(c)\xc2\xa0Contrary to Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s claim, the automobile exception is not a categorical one that permits the warrantless search of a vehicle anytime, anywhere, including in a home or curtilage.  <i>Scher</i> v. <i>United States,</i>\n\n305 U.\xc2\xa0S. 251; <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Labron,</i>\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938, distinguished.  Also unpersuasive is Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s proposed bright line rule for an automobile exception that would not permit warrantless entry only of the house itself or another fixed structure, <i>e.g.</i>, a garage, inside the curtilage.  This Court has long been clear that curtilage is afforded constitutional protection, and creating a carveout for certain types of curtilage seems more likely to create confusion than does uniform application of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine.  Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s rule also rests on a mistaken premise, for the ability to observe inside curtilage from a lawful vantage point is not the same as the right to enter curtilage without a warrant to search for information not otherwise accessible.  Finally, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s rule automatically would grant constitutional rights to those persons with the financial means to afford residences with garages but deprive those persons without such resources of any individualized consideration as to whether the areas in which they store their vehicles qualify as curtilage.

It does not.</p><p>I</p><p>Officer Matthew McCall of the Albemarle County Police Department in Virginia saw the driver of an orange and black motorcycle with an extended frame commit a traffic infraction.  The driver eluded Officer McCall\xe2\x80\x99s attempt to stop the motorcycle.  A few weeks later, Officer David Rhodes of the same department saw an orange and black motorcycle traveling well over the speed limit, but the driver got away from him, too.  The officers compared notes and concluded that the two incidents involved the same motorcyclist.</p><p>Upon further investigation, the officers learned that the motorcycle likely was stolen and in the possession of petitioner Ryan Collins.  After discovering photographs on Collins\xe2\x80\x99 Facebook profile that featured an orange and black motorcycle parked at the top of the driveway of a house, Officer Rhodes tracked down the address of the house, drove there, and parked on the street.  It was later established that Collins\xe2\x80\x99 girlfriend lived in the house and that Collins stayed there a few nights per week.[<a href="#F1">1</a>]</p><p>From his parked position on the street, Officer Rhodes saw what appeared to be a motorcycle with an extended frame covered with a white tarp, parked at the same angle and in the same location on the driveway as in the Facebook photograph.  Officer Rhodes, who did not have a warrant, exited his car and walked toward the house.  He stopped to take a photograph of the covered motorcycle from the sidewalk, and then walked onto the residential property and up to the top of the driveway to where the motorcycle was parked.  In order \xe2\x80\x9cto investigate further,\xe2\x80\x9d App. 80, Officer Rhodes pulled off the tarp, revealing a motorcycle that looked like the one from the speeding incident.  He then ran a search of the license plate and vehicle identification numbers, which confirmed that the motorcycle was stolen.  After gathering this information, Officer Rhodes took a photograph of the uncovered motorcycle, put the tarp back on, left the property, and returned to his car to wait for Collins.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Collins returned home.  Officer Rhodes walked up to the front door of the house and knocked.  Collins answered, agreed to speak with Officer Rhodes, and admitted that the motorcycle was his and that he had bought it without title.  Officer Rhodes then arrested Collins.</p><p>Collins was indicted by a Virginia grand jury for receiving stolen property.  He filed a pretrial motion to suppress the evidence that Officer Rhodes had obtained as a result of the warrantless search of the motorcycle.  Collins argued that Officer Rhodes had trespassed on the curtilage of the house to conduct an investigation in violation of the Fourth Amendment.  The trial court denied the motion and Collins was convicted.</p><p>The Court of Appeals of Virginia affirmed.  It assumed that the motorcycle was parked in the curtilage of the home and held that Officer Rhodes had probable cause to believe that the motorcycle under the tarp was the same motorcycle that had evaded him in the past.  It further concluded that Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99 actions were lawful under the Fourth Amendment even absent a warrant because \xe2\x80\x9cnumerous exigencies justified both his entry onto the property and his moving the tarp to view the motorcycle and record its identification number.\xe2\x80\x9d  65 Va. App. 37, 46, 773 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 618, 623 (2015).</p><p>The Supreme Court of Virginia affirmed on different reasoning.  It explained that the case was most properly resolved with reference to the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s automobile exception.  292 Va. 486, 496\xe2\x80\x93501, 790 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d 611, 616\xe2\x80\x93618 (2016).  Under that framework, it held that Officer Rhodes had probable cause to believe that the motorcycle was contraband, and that the warrantless search therefore was justified.  <i>Id.,</i> at 498\xe2\x80\x93499, 790 S.\xc2\xa0E. 2d, at 617.</p><p>We granted certiorari, 582 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2017), and now reverse.</p><p>II</p><p>The Fourth Amendment provides in relevant part that the \xe2\x80\x9cright of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated.\xe2\x80\x9d  This case arises at the intersection of two components of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment jurisprudence: the automobile exception to the warrant requirement and the protection extended to the curtilage of a home.</p><p>A</p><p>1</p><p>The Court has held that the search of an automobile can be reasonable without a warrant.  The Court first articulated the so-called automobile exception in <i>Carroll</i> v. <i>United States</i>,267 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132 (1925).  In that case, law enforcement officers had probable cause to believe that a car they observed traveling on the road contained illegal liquor.  They stopped and searched the car, discovered and seized the illegal liquor, and arrested the occupants.  <i>Id.,</i> at 134\xe2\x80\x93136.  The Court upheld the warrantless search and seizure, explaining that a \xe2\x80\x9cnecessary difference\xe2\x80\x9d exists between searching \xe2\x80\x9ca store, dwelling house or other structure\xe2\x80\x9d and searching \xe2\x80\x9ca ship, motor boat, wagon or automobile\xe2\x80\x9d because a \xe2\x80\x9cvehicle can be quickly moved out of the locality or jurisdiction in which the warrant must be sought.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 153.</p><p>The \xe2\x80\x9cready mobility\xe2\x80\x9d of vehicles served as the core justification for the automobile exception for many years.  <i>California</i> v. <i>Carney</i>,471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386, 390 (1985) (citing, <i>e.g., Cooper</i> v. <i>California</i>,386 U.\xc2\xa0S. 58, 59 (1967); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Maroney</i>,399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 42, 51\xe2\x80\x9352 (1970)).  Later cases then introduced an additional rationale based on \xe2\x80\x9cthe pervasive regulation of vehicles capable of traveling on the public highways.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Carney, </i>471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392.  As the Court explained in <i>South Dakota</i> v. <i>Opperman</i>,428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364 (1976):</p><p>\xe2\x80\x9cAutomobiles, unlike homes, are subjected to pervasive and continuing governmental regulation and controls, including periodic inspection and licensing requirements.  As an everyday occurrence, police stop and examine vehicles when license plates or inspection stickers have expired, or if other violations, such as exhaust fumes or excessive noise, are noted, or if headlights or other safety equipment are not in proper working order.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 368.</p><p>In announcing each of these two justifications, the Court took care to emphasize that the rationales applied only to automobiles and not to houses, and therefore supported \xe2\x80\x9ctreating automobiles differently from houses\xe2\x80\x9d as a constitutional matter.  <i>Cady</i> v. <i>Dombrowski</i>,413 U.\xc2\xa0S. 433, 441 (1973).</p><p>When these justifications for the automobile exception \xe2\x80\x9ccome into play,\xe2\x80\x9d officers may search an automobile without having obtained a warrant so long as they have probable cause to do so.  <i>Carney</i>, 471 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 392\xe2\x80\x93393.</p><p>2</p><p>Like the automobile exception, the Fourth Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s protection of curtilage has long been black letter law.  \xe2\x80\x9c[W]hen it comes to the Fourth Amendment, the home is first among equals.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Jardines</i>,569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 6 (2013).  \xe2\x80\x9cAt the Amendment\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x98very core\xe2\x80\x99 stands \xe2\x80\x98the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>Silverman</i> v. <i>United States</i>,365 U.\xc2\xa0S. 505, 511 (1961)).  To give full practical effect to that right, the Court considers curtilage\xe2\x80\x94\xe2\x80\x9cthe area \xe2\x80\x98immediately surrounding and associated with the home\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x94to be \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98part of the home itself for Fourth Amendment purposes.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jardines</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 6 (quoting <i>Oliver</i> v. <i>United States</i>,466 U.\xc2\xa0S. 170, 180 (1984)).  \xe2\x80\x9cThe protection afforded the curtilage is essentially a protection of families and personal privacy in an area intimately linked to the home, both physically and psychologically, where privacy expectations are most heightened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>California</i> v. <i>Ciraolo</i>,476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207, 212\xe2\x80\x93213 (1986).</p><p>When a law enforcement officer physically intrudes on the curtilage to gather evidence, a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred.  <i>Jardines</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 11.  Such conduct thus is presumptively unreasonable absent a warrant.</p><p>B</p><p>1</p><p>With this background in mind, we turn to the application of these doctrines in the instant case.  As an initial matter, we decide whether the part of the driveway where Collins\xe2\x80\x99 motorcycle was parked and subsequently searched is curtilage.</p><p>According to photographs in the record, the driveway runs alongside the front lawn and up a few yards past the front perimeter of the house.  The top portion of the driveway that sits behind the front perimeter of the house is enclosed on two sides by a brick wall about the height of a car and on a third side by the house.  A side door provides direct access between this partially enclosed section of the driveway and the house.  A visitor endeavoring to reach the front door of the house would have to walk partway up the driveway, but would turn off before entering the enclosure and instead proceed up a set of steps leading to the front porch.  When Officer Rhodes searched the motorcycle, it was parked inside this partially enclosed top portion of the driveway that abuts the house.</p><p>The \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98conception defining the curtilage\xe2\x80\x99 is .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. familiar enough that it is \xe2\x80\x98easily understood from our daily experience.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jardines</i>, 569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 7 (quoting <i>Oliver</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 182, n.\xc2\xa012).  Just like the front porch, side garden, or area \xe2\x80\x9coutside the front window,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Jardines, </i>569 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 6, the driveway enclosure where Officer Rhodes searched the motorcycle constitutes \xe2\x80\x9can area adjacent to the home and \xe2\x80\x98to which the activity of home life extends,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and so is properly considered curtilage, <i>id.,</i> at 7 (quoting <i>Oliver</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 182, n.\xc2\xa012).</p><p>2</p><p>In physically intruding on the curtilage of Collins\xe2\x80\x99 home to search the motorcycle, Officer Rhodes not only invaded Collins\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment interest in the item searched, <i>i.e., </i>the motorcycle, but also invaded Collins\xe2\x80\x99 Fourth Amendment interest in the curtilage of his home.  The question before the Court is whether the automobile exception justifies the invasion of the curtilage.[<a href="#F2">2</a>]  The answer is no.</p><p>Applying the relevant legal principles to a slightly different factual scenario confirms that this is an easy case.  Imagine a motorcycle parked inside the living room of a house, visible through a window to a passerby on the street.  Imagine further that an officer has probable cause to believe that the motorcycle was involved in a traffic infraction.  Can the officer, acting without a warrant, enter the house to search the motorcycle and confirm whether it is the right one?  Surely not.</p><p>The reason is that the scope of the automobile exception extends no further than the automobile itself.  See, <i>e.g.,</i> <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Labron</i>,518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938, 940 (1996) (<i>per curiam</i>) (explaining that the automobile exception \xe2\x80\x9cpermits police to search the vehicle\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>Wyoming</i> v. <i>Houghton</i>,526 U.\xc2\xa0S. 295, 300 (1999) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he Framers would have regarded as reasonable (if there was probable cause) the warrantless search of containers <i>within</i> an automobile\xe2\x80\x9d).  Virginia asks the Court to expand the scope of the automobile exception to permit police to invade any space outside an automobile even if the Fourth Amendment protects that space.  Nothing in our case law, however, suggests that the automobile exception gives an officer the right to enter a home or its curtilage to access a vehicle without a warrant.  Expanding the scope of the automobile exception in this way would both undervalue the core Fourth Amendment protection afforded to the home and its curtilage and \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98untether\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d the automobile exception \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98from the justifications underlying\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d it.  <i>Riley</i> v. <i>California</i>, 573 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 10) (quoting <i>Arizona</i> v. <i>Gant</i>,556 U.\xc2\xa0S. 332, 343 (2009)).</p><p>The Court already has declined to expand the scope of other exceptions to the warrant requirement to permit warrantless entry into the home.  The reasoning behind those decisions applies equally well in this context.  For instance, under the plain-view doctrine, \xe2\x80\x9cany valid warrantless seizure of incriminating evidence\xe2\x80\x9d requires that the officer \xe2\x80\x9chave a lawful right of access to the object itself.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Horton</i> v. <i>California</i>,496 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128, 136\xe2\x80\x93137 (1990); see also <i>id.,</i> at 137, n.\xc2\xa07 (\xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98[E]ven where the object is contraband, this Court has repeatedly stated and enforced the basic rule that the police may not enter and make a warrantless seizure\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d); <i>G. M. Leasing Corp.</i> v. <i>United States</i>,429 U.\xc2\xa0S. 338, 354 (1977) (\xe2\x80\x9cIt is one thing to seize without a warrant property resting in an open area .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. , and it is quite another thing to effect a warrantless seizure of property .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. situated on private premises to which access is not otherwise available for the seizing officer\xe2\x80\x9d).  A plain-view seizure thus cannot be justified if it is effectuated \xe2\x80\x9cby unlawful trespass.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Soldal</i> v. <i>Cook County</i>,506 U.\xc2\xa0S. 56, 66 (1992).  Had Officer Rhodes seen illegal drugs through the window of Collins\xe2\x80\x99 house, for example, assuming no other warrant exception applied, he could not have entered the house to seize them without first obtaining a warrant.</p><p>Similarly, it is a \xe2\x80\x9csettled rule that warrantless arrests in public places are valid,\xe2\x80\x9d but, absent another exception such as exigent circumstances, officers may not enter a home to make an arrest without a warrant, even when they have probable cause.  <i>Payton</i> v. <i>New York</i>,445 U.\xc2\xa0S. 573, 587\xe2\x80\x93590 (1980).  That is because being \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98arrested in the home involves not only the invasion attendant to all arrests but also an invasion of the sanctity of the home.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 588\xe2\x80\x93589 (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Reed</i>, 572 F.\xc2\xa02d 412, 423 (CA2 1978)).  Likewise, searching a vehicle parked in the curtilage involves not only the invasion of the Fourth Amendment interest in the vehicle but also an invasion of the sanctity of the curtilage.</p><p>Just as an officer must have a lawful right of access to any contraband he discovers in plain view in order to seize it without a warrant, and just as an officer must have a lawful right of access in order to arrest a person in his home, so, too, an officer must have a lawful right of access to a vehicle in order to search it pursuant to the automobile exception.  The automobile exception does not afford the necessary lawful right of access to search a vehicle parked within a home or its curtilage because it does not justify an intrusion on a person\xe2\x80\x99s separate and substantial Fourth Amendment interest in his home and curtilage.</p><p>As noted, the rationales underlying the automobile exception are specific to the nature of a vehicle and the ways in which it is distinct from a house.  See Part II\xe2\x80\x93A\xe2\x80\x931, <i>supra</i>.  The rationales thus take account only of the balance between the intrusion on an individual\xe2\x80\x99s Fourth Amendment interest in his vehicle and the governmental interests in an expedient search of that vehicle; they do not account for the distinct privacy interest in one\xe2\x80\x99s home or curtilage.  To allow an officer to rely on the automobile exception to gain entry into a house or its curtilage for the purpose of conducting a vehicle search would unmoor the exception from its justifications, render hollow the core Fourth Amendment protection the Constitution extends to the house and its curtilage, and transform what was meant to be an exception into a tool with far broader application.  Indeed, its name alone should make all this clear enough: It is, after all, an exception for automobiles.[<a href="#F3">3</a>]</p><p>Given the centrality of the Fourth Amendment interest in the home and its curtilage and the disconnect between that interest and the justifications behind the automobile exception, we decline Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s invitation to extend the automobile exception to permit a warrantless intrusion on a home or its curtilage.</p><p>III</p><p>A</p><p>Virginia argues that this Court\xe2\x80\x99s precedent indicates that the automobile exception is a categorical one that permits the warrantless search of a vehicle anytime, anywhere, including in a home or curtilage.  Specifically, Virginia points to two decisions that it contends resolve this case in its favor.  Neither is dispositive or persuasive.</p><p>First, Virginia invokes <i>Scher</i> v. <i>United States</i>,305 U.\xc2\xa0S. 251 (1938).  In that case, federal officers received a confidential tip that a particular car would be transporting bootleg liquor at a specified time and place.  The officers identified and followed the car until the driver \xe2\x80\x9cturned into a garage a few feet back of his residence and within the curtilage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 253.  As the driver exited his car, an officer approached and stated that he had been informed that the car was carrying contraband.  The driver acknowledged that there was liquor in the trunk, and the officer proceeded to open the trunk, find the liquor, arrest the driver, and seize both the car and the liquor.  <i>Id.,</i> at 253\xe2\x80\x93254.  Although the officer did not have a search warrant, the Court upheld the officer\xe2\x80\x99s actions as reasonable.  <i>Id.,</i> at 255.</p><p><i>Scher</i> is inapposite.  Whereas Collins\xe2\x80\x99 motorcycle was parked and unattended when Officer Rhodes intruded on the curtilage to search it, the officers in <i>Scher</i> first encountered the vehicle when it was being driven on public streets, approached the curtilage of the home only when the driver turned into the garage, and searched the vehicle only after the driver admitted that it contained contraband.  <i>Scher</i> by no means established a general rule that the automobile exception permits officers to enter a home or its curtilage absent a warrant.  The Court\xe2\x80\x99s brief analysis referenced <i>Carroll</i>, but only in the context of observing that, consistent with that case, the \xe2\x80\x9cofficers properly could have stopped\xe2\x80\x9d and searched the car \xe2\x80\x9cjust before [petitioner] entered the garage,\xe2\x80\x9d a proposition the petitioner did \xe2\x80\x9cnot seriously controvert.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Scher,</i> 305 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 254\xe2\x80\x93255.  The Court then explained that the officers did not lose their ability to stop and search the car when it entered \xe2\x80\x9cthe open garage closely followed by the observing officer\xe2\x80\x9d because \xe2\x80\x9c[n]o search was made of the garage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 255.  It emphasized that \xe2\x80\x9c[e]xamination of the automobile accompanied an arrest, without objection and upon admission of probable guilt,\xe2\x80\x9d and cited two search-incident-to-arrest cases.  <i>Ibid.</i> (citing <i>Agnello</i> v. <i>United States</i>,269 U.\xc2\xa0S. 20, 30 (1925); <i>Wisniewski</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 47 F.\xc2\xa02d 825, 826 (CA6 1931)).  <i>Scher</i>\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning thus was both case specific and imprecise, sounding in multiple doctrines, particularly, and perhaps most appropriately, hot pursuit.  The decision is best regarded as a factbound one, and it certainly does not control this case.</p><p>Second, Virginia points to <i>Labron</i>,518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938, where the Court upheld under the automobile exception the warrantless search of an individual\xe2\x80\x99s pickup truck that was parked in the driveway of his father-in-law\xe2\x80\x99s farmhouse.  <i>Id.,</i> at 939\xe2\x80\x93940; <i>Commonwealth </i>v. <i>Kilgore</i>, 544 Pa. 439, 444, <a class="related-case" href="/cases/pennsylvania/supreme-court/1995/544-pa-439-1.html">677 A.2d 311</a>, 313 (1995).  But <i>Labron </i>provides scant support for Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s position.  Unlike in this case, there was no indication that the individual who owned the truck in <i>Labron </i>had any Fourth Amendment interest in the farmhouse or its driveway, nor was there a determination that the driveway was curtilage.</p><p>B</p><p>Alternatively, Virginia urges the Court to adopt a more limited rule regarding the intersection of the automobile exception and the protection afforded to curtilage.  Virginia would prefer that the Court draw a bright line and hold that the automobile exception does not permit warrantless entry into \xe2\x80\x9cthe physical threshold of a house or a similar fixed, enclosed structure inside the curtilage like a garage.\xe2\x80\x9d  Brief for Respondent 46.  Requiring officers to make \xe2\x80\x9ccase-by-case curtilage determinations,\xe2\x80\x9d Virginia reasons, unnecessarily complicates matters and \xe2\x80\x9craises the potential for confusion and .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. error.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 46\xe2\x80\x9347 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p><p>The Court, though, has long been clear that curtilage is afforded constitutional protection.  See <i>Oliver</i>, 466 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 180.  As a result, officers regularly assess whether an area is curtilage before executing a search.  Virginia provides no reason to conclude that this practice has proved to be unadministrable, either generally or in this context.  Moreover, creating a carveout to the general rule that curtilage receives Fourth Amendment protection, such that certain types of curtilage would receive Fourth Amendment protection only for some purposes but not for others, seems far more likely to create confusion than does uniform application of the Court\xe2\x80\x99s doctrine.</p><p>In addition, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s proposed rule rests on a mistaken premise about the constitutional significance of visibility.  The ability to observe inside curtilage from a lawful vantage point is not the same as the right to enter curtilage without a warrant for the purpose of conducting a search to obtain information not otherwise accessible.  Cf. <i>Cir- aolo</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 213\xe2\x80\x93214 (holding that \xe2\x80\x9cphysically non- intrusive\xe2\x80\x9d warrantless aerial observation of the curtilage of a home did not violate the Fourth Amendment, and could form the basis for probable cause to support a warrant to search the curtilage).  So long as it is curtilage, a parking patio or carport into which an officer can see from the street is no less entitled to protection from trespass and a warrantless search than a fully enclosed garage.</p><p>Finally, Virginia\xe2\x80\x99s proposed bright-line rule automatically would grant constitutional rights to those persons with the financial means to afford residences with garages in which to store their vehicles but deprive those persons without such resources of any individualized consideration as to whether the areas in which they store their vehicles qualify as curtilage.  See <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ross</i>,456 U.\xc2\xa0S. 798, 822 (1982) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he most frail cottage in the kingdom is absolutely entitled to the same guarantees of privacy as the most majestic mansion\xe2\x80\x9d).</p><p>IV</p><p>For the foregoing reasons, we conclude that the automobile exception does not permit an officer without a warrant to enter a home or its curtilage in order to search a vehicle therein.  We leave for resolution on remand whether Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99 warrantless intrusion on the curtilage of Collins\xe2\x80\x99 house may have been reasonable on a different basis, such as the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.  The judgment of the Supreme Court of Virginia is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p><p>It is so ordered.</p><div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote"> <span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1">1</a></span> <span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Virginia does not dispute that Collins has Fourth Amendment standing.

Contrary to the dissent\xe2\x80\x99s suggestion, it is of no significance that the motorcycle was parked just a \xe2\x80\x9cshort walk up the driveway.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid</i>.  The driveway was private, not public, property, and the motorcycle was parked in the portion of the driveway beyond where a neighbor would venture, in an area \xe2\x80\x9cintimately linked to the home, .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. where privacy expectations are most heightened.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>California</i> v. <i>Ciraolo</i>,476 U.\xc2\xa0S. 207, 213 (1986).  Nor does it matter that Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x9cdid not damage any property,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post</i>, at 2, for an officer\xe2\x80\x99s care in conducting a search does not change the character of the place being searched.  And, as we explain, see <i>infra</i>, at 13\xe2\x80\x9314, it is not dispositive that Officer Rhodes did not \xe2\x80\x9cobserve anything along the way\xe2\x80\x9d to the motorcycle \xe2\x80\x9cthat he could not have seen from the street,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>post, </i>at 2.  Law enforcement officers need not \xe2\x80\x9cshield their eyes when passing by a home on public thoroughfares,\xe2\x80\x9d <i>Ciraolo</i>, 476 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 213, but the ability visually to observe an area protected by the Fourth Amendment does not give officers the green light physically to intrude on it.  See <i>Florida</i> v. <i>Jardines</i>,569 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1, 7\xe2\x80\x938 (2013).  It certainly does not permit an officer physically to intrude on curtilage, remove a tarp to reveal license plate and vehicle identification numbers, and use those numbers to confirm that the defendant committed a crime. The dissent also mistakenly relies on a law enacted by the First Congress and mentioned in <i>Carroll</i> v. <i>United States</i>,267 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132, 150\xe2\x80\x93151 (1925), that authorized the warrantless search of vessels.  <i>Post</i>, at 4\xe2\x80\x935, n.\xc2\xa03.

To the contrary, whereas the statute relied upon in <i>Carroll</i> authorized warrantless searches of vessels, it expressly required warrants to search houses.  See 267 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 150\xe2\x80\x93157; Act of July 31, 1789, \xc2\xa724,1Stat.43.

At the founding, curtilage was considered part of the \xe2\x80\x9chous[e]\xe2\x80\x9d itself.  See 4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 225 (1769) (\xe2\x80\x9c[T]he capital house protects and privileges all its branches and appurtenants, if within the curtilage\xe2\x80\x9d).

And this Court did not adopt the federal exclusionary rule until the 20th century.  See <i>Weeks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n232 U.\xc2\xa0S. 383 (1914).  As late as 1949, nearly two-thirds of the States did not have an exclusionary rule.  See <i>Wolf</i> v. <i>Colorado</i>,\n\n338 U.\xc2\xa0S. 25, 29 (1949).

And the common law sometimes reflected the inverse of the exclusionary rule: The fact that someone turned out to be guilty could <i>justify</i> an illegal seizure.

To the extent these enclaves are delegations of lawmaking authority from the Constitution or a federal statute, they do not conflict with the original meaning of the Supremacy Clause (though they might be illegitimate for other reasons).  See Ramsey 568\xe2\x80\x93569; Grano, Prophylactic Rules in Criminal Procedure: A Question of Article III Legitimacy, 80 Nw. U. L.\xc2\xa0Rev. 100, 131\xe2\x80\x93132 (1985).

From his vantage point on the street, Rhodes saw an object covered with a tarp in the driveway, just a car\xe2\x80\x99s length or two from the curb.  It is undisputed that Rhodes had probable cause to believe that the object under the tarp was a motorcycle that had been involved a few months earlier in a dangerous highway chase, eluding the police at speeds in excess of 140 mph.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 22; App. to Pet. for Cert. 67.  Rhodes also had probable cause to believe that petitioner had been operating the motorcycle[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>] and that a search of the motorcycle would provide evidence that the motorcycle had been stolen.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">If the motorcycle had been parked at the curb, instead of in the driveway, it is undisputed that Rhodes could have searched it without obtaining a warrant.  See Tr. of Oral Arg. 9; Reply Brief 1.  Nearly a century ago, this Court held that officers with probable cause may search a motor vehicle without obtaining a warrant.  <i>Carroll</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n267 U.\xc2\xa0S. 132, 153, 155\xe2\x80\x93156 (1925).  The principal rationale for this so-called automobile or motor-vehicle exception to the warrant requirement is the risk that the vehicle will be moved during the time it takes to obtain a warrant.  <i>Id.</i>, at 153; <i>California</i> v. <i>Carney</i>,\n\n471 U.\xc2\xa0S. 386, 390\xe2\x80\x93391 (1985).

Because, in order to reach the motorcycle, he had to walk 30 feet or so up the driveway of the house rented by petitioner\xe2\x80\x99s girlfriend, and by doing that, Rhodes invaded the home\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9ccurtilage.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ante</i>, at 6\xe2\x80\x937.  The Court does not dispute that the motorcycle, when parked in the driveway, was just as mobile as it would have been had it been parked at the curb.  Nor does the Court claim that Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s short walk up the driveway did petitioner or his girlfriend any harm.  Rhodes did not damage any property or observe anything along the way that he could not have seen from the street.  But, the Court insists, Rhodes could not enter the driveway without a warrant, and therefore his search of the motorcycle was unreasonable and the evidence obtained in that search must be suppressed.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">An ordinary person of common sense would react to the Court\xe2\x80\x99s decision the way Mr. Bumble famously responded when told about a legal rule that did not comport with the reality of everyday life.

The concept plays no other role in\n \nFourth Amendment analysis.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, there is no dispute that the search of the motorcycle was governed by the\n \nFourth Amendment, and therefore whether or not it occurred within the curtilage is not of any direct importance.  The question before us is not whether there was a\n \nFourth Amendment search but whether the search was reasonable.  And the only possible argument as to why it might not be reasonable concerns the need for a warrant.  For nearly a century, however, it has been well established that officers do not need a warrant to search a motor vehicle on public streets so long as they have probable cause.  <i>Carroll</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 153, 156; see also, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>Pennsylvania</i> v. <i>Labron</i>,\n\n518 U.\xc2\xa0S. 938, 940 (1996) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>Carney</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 394; <i>South Dakota</i> v. <i>Opperman</i>,\n\n428 U.\xc2\xa0S. 364, 367\xe2\x80\x93368 (1976); <i>Chambers</i> v. <i>Maroney</i>,\n\n399 U.\xc2\xa0S. 42, 50\xe2\x80\x9351 (1970).  Thus, the issue here is whether there is any good reason why this same rule should not apply when the vehicle is parked in plain view in a driveway just a few feet from the street.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In considering that question, we should ask whether the reasons for the \xe2\x80\x9cautomobile exception\xe2\x80\x9d are any less valid in this new situation.  Is the vehicle parked in the driveway any less mobile?  Are any greater privacy interests at stake?  If the answer to those questions is \xe2\x80\x9cno,\xe2\x80\x9d then the automobile exception should apply.  And here, the answer to each question is emphatically \xe2\x80\x9cno.\xe2\x80\x9d  The tarp-covered motorcycle parked in the driveway could have been uncovered and ridden away in a matter of seconds.  And Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s brief walk up the driveway impaired no real privacy interests.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In this case, the Court uses the curtilage concept in a way that is contrary to our decisions regarding other, exigency-based exceptions to the warrant requirement.  Take, for example, the \xe2\x80\x9cemergency aid\xe2\x80\x9d exception.  See <i>Brigham City</i> v. <i>Stuart</i>,\n\n547 U.\xc2\xa0S. 398 (2006).  When officers reasonably believe that a person inside a dwelling has urgent need of assistance, they may cross the curtilage and enter the building without first obtaining a warrant.  <i>Id.</i>, at 403\xe2\x80\x93404.  The same is true when officers reasonably believe that a person in a dwelling is destroying evidence.  See <i>Kentucky</i> v. <i>King</i>,\n\n563 U.\xc2\xa0S. 452, 460 (2011).  In both of those situations, we ask whether \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the exigencies of the situation\xe2\x80\x99 make the needs of law enforcement so compelling that the warrantless search is objectively reasonable.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Brigham City</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 403 (quoting <i>Mincey</i> v. <i>Arizona</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 385, 394 (1978)).  We have not held that the need to cross the curtilage independently necessitates a warrant, and there is no good reason to apply a different rule here.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">It is no answer to this argument that the emergency-aid and destruction-of-evidence exceptions require an inquiry into the practicality of obtaining a warrant in the particular circumstances of the case.  Our precedents firmly establish that the motor-vehicle exception, unlike these other exceptions, \xe2\x80\x9chas no separate exigency requirement.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Maryland</i> v. <i>Dyson</i>,\n\n527 U.\xc2\xa0S. 465, 466\xe2\x80\x93467 (1999) (<i>per curiam</i>).  It is settled that the mobility of a motor vehicle categorically obviates any need to engage in such a case-specific inquiry.  Requiring such an inquiry here would mark a substantial alteration of settled\n \nFourth Amendment law.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">This does not mean, however, that a warrant is never needed when officers have probable cause to search a motor vehicle, no matter where the vehicle is located.  While a case-specific inquiry regarding <i>exigency</i> would be inconsistent with the rationale of the motor-vehicle exception, a case-specific inquiry regarding <i>the degree of intrusion on privacy</i> is entirely appropriate when the motor vehicle to be searched is located on private property.  After all, the ultimate inquiry under the\n \nFourth Amendment is whether a search is reasonable, and that inquiry often turns on the degree of the intrusion on privacy.  Thus, contrary to the opinion of the Court, an affirmance in this case would not mean that officers could perform a warrantless search if a motorcycle were located inside a house.  See <i>ante</i>, at 7.  In that situation, the intrusion on privacy would be far greater than in the present case, where the real effect, if any, is negligible.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">I would affirm the decision below and therefore respectfully dissent.</p>\n<div class="opinion-footnotes"><h3>Notes</h3><div class="opinion-footnote">\n<span class="opinion-footnote-ref"><a href="#T1" name="F1">1</a></span>\n<span class="opinion-footnote-text">\xc2\xa0Petitioner had a photo on his Facebook profile of a motorcycle that resembled the unusual motorcycle involved in the prior highway chase.

Since the First Congress sent the Bill of Rights to the States for ratification, we have often looked to laws enacted by that Congress as evidence of the original understanding of the meaning of those Amendments.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, <i>id.</i>, at 150\xe2\x80\x93151; <i>Town of Greece</i> v. <i>Galloway</i>, 572 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___\xe2\x80\x93___ (2014) (slip op., at 7\xe2\x80\x938); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Villamonte-Marquez</i>,\n\n462 U.\xc2\xa0S. 579, 585\xe2\x80\x93586 (1983); <i>United States</i> v. <i>Ramsey</i>,\n\n431 U.\xc2\xa0S. 606, 616\xe2\x80\x93617 (1977).  <i>Carroll</i> itself noted that the First Congress enacted a law authorizing officers to search vessels without a warrant.  267 U.\xc2\xa0S., at 150\xe2\x80\x93151.  Although this statute did not expressly state that these officers could cross private property such as wharves in order to reach and board those vessels, I think that was implicit.  Otherwise, the statute would very often have been ineffective.  And when Congress later enacted similar laws, it made this authorization express.  See, <i>e.g.</i>, An Act Further to Prevent Smuggling and for Other Purposes, \xc2\xa75,\n\n14Stat.\n179.  For this reason, Officer Rhodes\xe2\x80\x99s conduct in this case is consistent with the original understanding of the\n \nFourth Amendment, as explicated in <i>Carroll</i>. </span>\n</div></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>'
