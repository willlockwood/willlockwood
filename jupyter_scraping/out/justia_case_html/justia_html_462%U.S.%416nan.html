A violation of the ordinance is punishable as a misdemeanor.  Respondents and cross-petitioners filed an action in Federal District Court against petitioners and cross-respondents, challenging the ordinance.

By preventing the performance of dilatation-and-evacuation abortions in an appropriate nonhospital setting, Akron has imposed a heavy and unnecessary burden on women\'s access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure.  Section 1870.03 has the effect of inhibiting the vast majority of abortions after the first trimester, and therefore unreasonably infringes upon a woman\'s constitutional right to obtain an abortion.

Section 1870.05(B) is unconstitutional as making a blanket determination that <em>all</em> minors under the age of 15 are too immature to make an abortion decision, or that an abortion never may be in the minor\'s best interests without parental approval.  Under circumstances where the Ohio statute governing juvenile proceedings does not mention minors\' abortions nor suggest that the Ohio Juvenile Court has authority to inquire into a minor\'s maturity or emancipation, \xc2\xa7 1870.05(B), as applied in juvenile proceedings, is not reasonably susceptible of being construed to create an opportunity for case-by-case evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors.

While a State may require a physician to make certain that his patient understands the physical and emotional implications of having an abortion, \xc2\xa7 1870.06(B) goes far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to informed consent.

There is no evidence that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely.  Nor does it appear that the State\'s legitimate concern that the woman\'s decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.

Legislative responses to the Court\'s decision have required us on several occasions, and again today, to define the limits of a State\'s authority to regulate the performance of abortions.

[<a href="#F8" name="T8">Footnote 8</a>]  The ordinance became effective on May 1, 1978.</p>\n<p>On April 19 1978, a lawsuit challenging virtually all of the ordinance\'s provisions was filed in the District Court for the Northern District of Ohio.  The plaintiffs, respondents and cross-petitioners in this Court, were three corporations that operate abortion clinics in Akron and a physician who has performed abortions at one of the clinics.  The defendants, petitioners and cross-respondents here, were the city of Akron and three city officials (Akron).  Two individuals (intervenors) were permitted to intervene as codefendants "in their individual capacity as parents of unmarried minor daughters of childbearing age."  479 F.Supp. 1172, 1181 (1979).  On April 27, 1978, the District Court preliminarily enjoined enforcement of the ordinance.</p>\n<p>In August, 1979, after hearing evidence, the District Court ruled on the merits.  It found that plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge seven provisions of the ordinance, none of which is before this Court.  The District Court invalidated four provisions, including  \xc2\xa7 1870.05 (parental notice and consent), \xc2\xa7 1870.06(B) (requiring disclosure of facts concerning the woman\'s pregnancy, fetal development, the complications of abortion, and agencies available to assist the woman), and  \xc2\xa7 1870.16 (disposal of fetal remains).  The court upheld the constitutionality of the remainder of the ordinance, including  \xc2\xa7 1870.03 (hospitalization for abortions after the first trimester),  \xc2\xa7 1870.06(C) (requiring disclosure of the particular risks of the woman\'s pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed), and  \xc2\xa7 1870.07 (24-hour waiting period). </p><p><a class="page-number" name="426">Page 462 U.

It affirmed the District Court\'s decision that  \xc2\xa7 1870.03\'s hospitalization requirement is constitutional.  It also affirmed the ruling that \xc2\xa7 1870.05, \xc2\xa7 1870.06(B), and \xc2\xa7 1870.16 are unconstitutional.  The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court\'s decision on  \xc2\xa7 1870.06(C) and \xc2\xa7 1870.07, finding these provisions to be unconstitutional.</p>\n<p>Three separate petitions for certiorari were filed.  In light of the importance of the issues presented, and in particular the conflicting decisions as to whether a State may require that all second trimester abortions be performed in a hospital, [<a href="#F9" name="T9">Footnote 9</a>] we granted both Akron\'s and the plaintiffs\' petitions.  456 U.S. 988 (1982).

In <em>Danforth, supra,</em> we unanimously upheld two Missouri statutory provisions, applicable to the first trimester, requiring the woman to provide her informed written consent to the abortion and the physician to keep certain records, even though comparable requirements were not imposed on most other medical procedures.  <em>See</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#65">428 U.

The decisive factor was that the State met its burden of demonstrating that these regulations furthered important health-related state concerns. [<a href="#F13" name="T13">Footnote 13</a>]  But even these minor regulations on the abortion procedure during the first trimester may not interfere with physician-patient consultation or with the woman\'s choice between abortion and childbirth.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#81">428 U.

The State\'s discretion to regulate on this basis does not, however, permit it to adopt abortion regulations that depart from accepted medical practice.

Accreditation by these organizations requires compliance with comprehensive standards governing a wide variety of health and surgical services. [<a href="#F16" name="T16">Footnote 16</a>]  The ordinance thus prevents the performance of abortions in outpatient facilities that are not part of an acute care, full-service hospital. [<a href="#F17" name="T17">Footnote 17</a>]</p>\n<p>In the District Court, plaintiffs sought to demonstrate that this hospitalization requirement has a serious detrimental impact on a woman\'s ability to obtain a second trimester abortion in Akron, and that it is not reasonably related to the State\'s interest in the health of the pregnant woman.  The District Court did not reject this argument, but rather found the evidence "not . . . so convincing that it is willing to discard the Supreme Court\'s formulation in <em>Roe</em>" of a line between impermissible first trimester regulation and permissible second trimester regulation.  479 F.Supp. at 1215.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on a similar basis.  It accepted plaintiffs\' argument that Akron\'s hospitalization requirement did not have a reasonable health justification during at least part of the second trimester, but declined to "retreat from the <em>bright line\' in <em>Roe v.

We noted, for example, that States could establish requirements relating</p>\n<p>"to the facility in which the procedure is to be performed, that is, whether it must be in a hospital or may be a clinic or some other place of less-than-hospital status."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em>  In the companion case of <em>Doe v. Bolton,</em> the Court invalidated a Georgia requirement that all abortions be performed in a hospital licensed by the State Board of Health and accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals.  <em>See</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html#201">410 U.

S. 195</a></span>.  We found, however, that</p>\n<p>"the State must show more than [was shown in <em>Doe</em>] in order to prove that only the full resources of </p><p><a class="page-number" name="434">Page 462 U. S. 434</a></p><p> a licensed hospital, rather than those of some other appropriately licensed institution, satisfy these health interests."</p>\n<p><em>Ibid.</em> [<a href="#F19" name="T19">Footnote 19</a>]</p>\n<p>We reaffirm today, <em>see supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#429">462 U. S. 429</a></span>, n. 11, that a State\'s interest in health regulation becomes compelling at approximately the end of the first trimester.  The existence of a compelling state interest in health, however, is only the beginning of the inquiry.  The State\'s regulation may be upheld only if it is reasonably designed to further that state interest.  <em>See Doe,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html#195">410 U. S. 195</a></span>.  And the Court in <em>Roe</em> did not hold that it always is reasonable for a State to adopt an abortion regulation that applies to the entire second trimester.  A State necessarily must have latitude in adopting regulations of general applicability in this sensitive area.  But if it appears that, during a substantial portion of the second trimester, the State\'s regulation "depart[s] from accepted medical practice," <em>supra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#431">462 U. S. 431</a></span>, the regulation may not be upheld simply because it may be reasonable for the remaining portion of the trimester.  Rather, the State is obligated to make a reasonable effort to limit the effect of its regulations to the period in the trimester during which its health interest will be furthered.</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>There can be no doubt that  \xc2\xa7 1870.03\'s second trimester hospitalization requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.  A primary burden created by the requirement is additional cost to the woman.  The Court of Appeals noted that there was testimony that a second trimester abortion costs more than twice as much in a </p><p><a class="page-number" name="435">Page 462 U. S. 435</a></p><p> hospital as in a clinic.  <em>See</em> 651 F.2d at 1209 (in-hospital abortion costs $850-$900, whereas a dilatation-and-evacuation (D&amp;E) abortion performed in a clinic costs $350-$400). [<a href="#F20" name="T20">Footnote 20</a>]  Moreover, the court indicated that second trimester abortions were rarely performed in Akron hospitals.  <em>Ibid.</em> (only nine second trimester abortions performed in Akron hospitals in the year before trial). [<a href="#F21" name="T21">Footnote 21</a>]  Thus, a second trimester hospitalization requirement may force women to travel to find available facilities, resulting in both financial expense and additional health risk.  It therefore is apparent that a second trimester hospitalization requirement may significantly limit a woman\'s ability to obtain an abortion.</p>\n<p>Akron does not contend that  \xc2\xa7 1870.03 imposes only an insignificant burden on women\'s access to abortion, but rather defends it as a reasonable health regulation.  This position had strong support at the time of <em>Roe v. Wade,</em> as hospitalization for second trimester abortions was recommended by the American Public Health Association (APHA), <em>see Roe,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#143">410 U. S. 143</a></span>-146, and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), <em>see</em> Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 65 (4th ed.1974).  Since then, however, the safety of second trimester abortions has increased </p><p><a class="page-number" name="436">Page 462 U. S. 436</a></p><p> dramatically. [<a href="#F22" name="T22">Footnote 22</a>]  The principal reason is that the D&amp;E procedure is now widely and successfully used for second trimester abortions. [<a href="#F23" name="T23">Footnote 23</a>]  The Court of Appeals found that there was "an abundance of evidence that D&amp;E is the safest method of performing post-first trimester abortions today."  651 F.2d at 1209.  The availability of the D&amp;E procedure during the interval between approximately 12 and 16 weeks of pregnancy, a period during which other second trimester abortion techniques generally cannot be used, [<a href="#F24" name="T24">Footnote 24</a>] has meant that women desiring an early second trimester abortion no longer are forced to incur the health risks of waiting until at least the 16th week of pregnancy.</p>\n<p>For our purposes, an even more significant factor is that experience indicates that D&amp;E may be performed safely on an outpatient basis in appropriate nonhospital facilities.  The evidence is strong enough to have convinced the APHA to abandon its prior recommendation of hospitalization for all second trimester abortions:</p>\n<p>"Current data show that abortions occurring in the second trimester can be safely performed by the Dilatation and Evacuation (D and E) procedure. . . .  Requirements that all abortions after 12 weeks of gestation be performed in hospitals increase the expense and inconvenience to the woman without contributing to the safety of the procedure."</p>\n<p>APHA Recommended Program </p><p><a class="page-number" name="437">Page 462 U. S. 437</a></p><p> Guide for Abortion Services (Revised 1979), 70 Am.J.Public Health 652, 654 (1980) (hereinafter APHA Recommended Guide).</p>\n<p>Similarly, the ACOG no longer suggests that all second trimester abortions be performed in a hospital.  It recommends that abortions performed in a physician\'s office or outpatient clinic be limited to 14 weeks of pregnancy, but it indicates that abortions may be performed safely in</p>\n<p>"a hospital-based or in a free-standing ambulatory surgical facility, or in an outpatient clinic meeting the criteria required for a free-standing surgical facility,"</p>\n<p>until 18 weeks of pregnancy.  ACOG, Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 54 (5th ed.1982).</p>\n<p>These developments, and the professional commentary supporting them, constitute impressive evidence that -- at least during the early weeks of the second trimester -- D&amp;E abortions may be performed as safely in an outpatient clinic as in a full-service hospital. [<a href="#F25" name="T25">Footnote 25</a>]  We conclude, therefore, that "present medical knowledge," <em>Roe, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163">410 U. S. 163</a></span>, convincingly undercuts Akron\'s justification for requiring that <em>all</em> second trimester abortions be performed in a hospital.

[<a href="#F27" name="T27">Footnote 27</a>]  Brief for Respondents in No. 81-1172, p.19.  It is true that a state abortion regulation is not unconstitutional simply because it does not correspond perfectly in all cases to the asserted state interest.  But the lines drawn in a state regulation must be reasonable, and this cannot be said of  \xc2\xa7 1870.03.  By preventing the performance of D&amp;E abortions in an appropriate nonhospital setting, Akron has imposed a heavy, and unnecessary, burden on women\'s access to a relatively inexpensive, otherwise accessible, and safe abortion procedure. [<a href="#F28" name="T28">Footnote 28</a>]  Section 1870.03 has "the effect of inhibiting . . . the vast majority of abortions after the first 12 weeks," <em>Danforth,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#79">428 U.

The District Court invalidated this provision because</p>\n<p>"[i]t does not establish a procedure by which a minor can avoid a parental veto of her abortion decision by demonstrating that her decision is, in fact, informed.  Rather, it requires, in all cases, both the minor\'s informed consent and either parental consent or a court order."</p>\n<p>479 F.Supp. at 1201.  The Court of Appeals affirmed on the same basis. [<a href="#F29" name="T29">Footnote 29</a>]  The relevant legal standards are not in dispute.  The Court has held that</p>\n<p>"the State may not impose a blanket provision . . . requiring the consent of a parent or person <em>in loco parentis</em> as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor."</p>\n<p><em>Danforth, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#74">428 U.

It is reasonable to assume, as we did in <em>Bellotti I, supra,</em> and <em>Matheson, supra,</em> that a state court, presented with a state statute specifically governing abortion consent procedures for pregnant minors, will attempt to construe the statute consistently with constitutional requirements.  This suit, however, concerns a municipal ordinance that creates no procedures for making the necessary determinations.  Akron seeks to invoke the Ohio statute governing juvenile proceedings, but that statute neither mentions minors\' abortions nor suggests that the Ohio Juvenile Court has authority to inquire into a minor\'s maturity or emancipation. [<a href="#F31" name="T31">Footnote 31</a>]  In these circumstances, we do not think that the Akron ordinance, as applied in Ohio juvenile proceedings, is reasonably susceptible of being construed to create an "opportunity for case-by-case evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors."  <em>Bellotti II, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html">443 U.

The Court of Appeals concluded that both provisions were unconstitutional.  <em>See</em> 651 F.2d at 1207.

The decision to have an abortion has "implications far broader than those associated with most other kinds of medical treatment," <em>Bellotti II,</em> 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#649">443 U.

[<a href="#F32" name="T32">Footnote 32</a>]  This does not mean, however, that a State has unreviewable authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an abortion.  It remains primarily the responsibility of the physician to ensure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient, depending on her particular circumstances.  <em>Danforth\'s</em> recognition of the State\'s interest in ensuring that this information be given </p><p><a class="page-number" name="444">Page 462 U. S. 444</a></p><p> will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the woman\'s informed choice between abortion or childbirth. [<a href="#F33" name="T33">Footnote 33</a>]</p>\n<p><em>B\n</em></p>\n<p>Viewing the city\'s regulations in this light, we believe that \xc2\xa7 1879.06(B) attempts to extend the State\'s interest in ensuring "informed consent" beyond permissible limits.  First, it is fair to say that much of the information required is designed not to inform the woman\'s consent, but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether.  Subsection (3) requires the physician to inform his patient that "the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception," a requirement inconsistent with the Court\'s holding in <em>Roe v. Wade</em> that a State may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions.  <em>See</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#159">410 U. S. 159</a></span>-162.  Moreover, much of the detailed description of "the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the particular unborn child" required by subsection (3) would involve, at best, speculation by the physician. [<a href="#F34" name="T34">Footnote 34</a>]  And subsection (5), that begins with the dubious statement that "abortion is a major surgical procedure" [<a href="#F35" name="T35">Footnote 35</a>] and proceeds to describe numerous possible </p><p><a class="page-number" name="445">Page 462 U. S. 445</a></p><p> physical and psychological complications of abortion, [<a href="#F36" name="T36">Footnote 36</a>] is a "parade of horribles" intended to suggest that abortion is a particularly dangerous procedure.</p>\n<p>An additional, and equally decisive, objection to \xc2\xa7 1870.06(B) is its intrusion upon the discretion of the pregnant woman\'s physician.  This provision specifies a litany of information that the physician must recite to each woman regardless of whether, in his judgment, the information is relevant to her personal decision.  For example, even if the physician believes that some of the risks outlined in subsection (5) are nonexistent for a particular patient, he remains obligated to describe them to her.  In <em>Danforth,</em> the Court warned against placing the physician in just such an "undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U. S. 67</a></span>, n. 8.  Consistent with its interest in ensuring informed consent, a State may require that a physician make certain that his patient understands the physical and emotional implications of having an abortion.  But Akron has gone far beyond merely describing the general subject matter relevant to informed consent.  By insisting upon recitation of a lengthy and inflexible list of information, Akron unreasonably has placed "obstacles in the path of the doctor upon whom [the woman is] entitled to rely for advice in connection with her decision."  <em>Whalen v. Roe,</em> 429 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/429/589/case.html#604">429 U. S. 604</a></span>, n. 33. [<a href="#F37" name="T37">Footnote 37</a>] </p><p><a class="page-number" name="446">Page 462 U. S. 446</a></p><p></p>\n<p><em>C\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 1870.06(C) presents a different question.  Under this provision, the "attending physician" must inform the woman</p>\n<p>"of the particular risks associated with her own pregnancy and the abortion technique to be employed including providing her with at least a general description of the medical instructions to be followed subsequent to the abortion in order to insure her safe recovery, and shall in addition provide her with such other information which in his own medical judgment is relevant to her decision as to whether to have an abortion or carry her pregnancy to term."</p>\n<p>The information required clearly is related to maternal health and to the State\'s legitimate purpose in requiring informed consent.  Nonetheless, the Court of Appeals determined that it interfered with the physician\'s medical judgment</p>\n<p>"in exactly the same way as Section 1870.06(B).  It requires the doctor to make certain disclosures in all cases, regardless of his own professional judgment as to the desirability of doing so."</p>\n<p>651 F.2d at 1207.  This was a misapplication of <em>Danforth.</em>  There we construed "informed consent" to mean "the giving of information to the patient as to just what would be done and as to its consequences."  428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U. S. 67</a></span>, n. 8.  We see no significant difference in Akron\'s requirement that the woman be told of the particular risks of her pregnancy and the abortion technique to be </p><p><a class="page-number" name="447">Page 462 U. S. 447</a></p><p> used, and be given general instructions on proper post-abortion care.  Moreover, in contrast to subsection (B), \xc2\xa7 1879.06(C) merely describes in general terms the information to be disclosed.  It properly leaves the precise nature and amount of this disclosure to the physician\'s discretion and "medical judgment."</p>\n<p>The Court of Appeals also held, however, that \xc2\xa7 1879.06(C) was invalid because it required that the disclosure be made by the "attending physician."  The court found that</p>\n<p>"the practice of all three plaintiff clinics has been for the counseling to be conducted by persons other than the doctor who performs the abortion,"</p>\n<p>651 F.2d at 1207, and determined that Akron had not justified requiring the physician personally to describe the health risks.  Akron challenges this holding as contrary to our cases that emphasize the importance of the physician-patient relationship.  In Akron\'s view, as in the view of the dissenting judge below, the "attending physician" requirement "does no more than seek to ensure that there is, in fact, a true physician-patient relationship even for the woman who goes to an abortion clinic."  <em>Id.</em> at 1217 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).</p>\n<p>Requiring physicians personally to discuss the abortion decision, its health risks, and consequences with each patient may in some cases add to the cost of providing abortions, though the record here does not suggest that ethical physicians will charge more for adhering to this typical element of the physician-patient relationship.  Yet in <em>Roe</em> and subsequent cases we have</p>\n<p>"stressed repeatedly the central role of the physician, both in consulting with the woman about whether or not to have an abortion and in determining how any abortion was to be carried out."</p>\n<p><em>Colautti v. Franklin,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/case.html#387">439 U. S. 387</a></span>.  Moreover, we have left no doubt that, to ensure the safety of the abortion procedure, the States may mandate that only physicians perform abortions.  <em>See Connecticut v. Menillo,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/9/case.html">423 U. S. 9</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/423/9/case.html#11">423 U.

S. 165</a></span>. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="448">Page 462 U. S. 448</a></p><p></p>\n<p>We are not convinced, however, that there is as vital a state need for insisting that the physician performing the abortion, or for that matter any physician, personally counsel the patient in the absence of a request.  The State\'s interest is in ensuring that the woman\'s consent is informed and unpressured; the critical factor is whether she obtains the necessary information and counseling from a qualified person, not the identity of the person from whom she obtains it. [<a href="#F38" name="T38">Footnote 38</a>]  Akron and intervenors strongly urge that the nonphysician counselors at the plaintiff abortion clinics are not trained or qualified to perform this important function.  The courts below made no such findings, however, and, on the record before us, we cannot say that the woman\'s consent to the abortion will not be informed if a physician delegates the counseling task to another qualified individual.</p>\n<p>In so holding, we do not suggest that the State is powerless to vindicate its interest in making certain the "important" and "stressful" decision to abort "[i]s made with full knowledge of its nature and consequences."  <em>Danforth,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U. S. 67</a></span>.  Nor do we imply that a physician may abdicate his essential role as the person ultimately responsible for the medical aspects of the decision to perform the abortion. [<a href="#F39" name="T39">Footnote 39</a>]  A </p><p><a class="page-number" name="449">Page 462 U. S. 449</a></p><p> State may define the physician\'s responsibility to include verification that adequate counseling has been provided and that the woman\'s consent is informed. [<a href="#F40" name="T40">Footnote 40</a>]  In addition, the State may establish reasonable minimum qualifications for those people who perform the primary counseling function. [<a href="#F41" name="T41">Footnote 41</a>]  <em>See, e.g., Doe,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/179/case.html#195">410 U. S. 195</a></span> (State may require a medical facility "to possess all the staffing and services necessary to perform an abortion safely").  In light of these alternatives, we believe that it is unreasonable for a State to insist that only a physician is competent to provide the information and counseling relevant to informed consent.  We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals that \xc2\xa7 1879.06(C) is invalid.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VI</h3><p></p>\n<p>The Akron ordinance prohibits a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant woman signs a consent form.  \xc2\xa7 1879.07. [<a href="#F42" name="T42">Footnote 42</a>]  The District Court upheld this provision on the ground that it furthered Akron\'s interest in ensuring "that a woman\'s abortion decision is made after careful consideration of all the facts applicable to her particular </p><p><a class="page-number" name="450">Page 462 U. S. 450</a></p><p> situation."  479 F.Supp. at 1204.  The Court of Appeals reversed, finding that the inflexible waiting period had "no medical basis," and that careful consideration of the abortion decision by the woman "is beyond the state\'s power to require."  651 F.2d at 1208.  We affirm the Court of Appeals\' judgment.</p>\n<p>The District Court found that the mandatory 24-hour waiting period increases the cost of obtaining an abortion by requiring the woman to make two separate trips to the abortion facility.  <em>See</em> 479 F.Supp. at 1204.  Plaintiffs also contend that, because of scheduling difficulties, the effective delay may be longer than 24 hours, and that such a delay in some cases could increase the risk of an abortion.  Akron denies that any significant health risk is created by a 24-hour waiting period, and argues that a brief period of delay -- with the opportunity for reflection on the counseling received -- often will be beneficial to the pregnant woman.</p>\n<p>We find that Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period.  There is no evidence suggesting that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely.  Nor are we convinced that the State\'s legitimate concern that the woman\'s decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24-hour delay as a matter of course.  The decision whether to proceed with an abortion is one as to which it is important to "affor[d] the physician adequate discretion in the exercise of his medical judgment."  <em>Colautti v. Franklin,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/case.html#387">439 U. S. 387</a></span>.  In accordance with the ethical standards of the profession, a physician will advise the patient to defer the abortion when he thinks this will be beneficial to her. [<a href="#F43" name="T43">Footnote 43</a>]  But if a woman, after appropriate counseling, is prepared </p><p><a class="page-number" name="451">Page 462 U. S. 451</a></p><p> to give her written informed consent and proceed with the abortion, a State may not demand that she delay the effectuation of that decision.</p>\n<p></p><h3>VII</h3><p></p>\n<p>Section 1870.16 of the Akron ordinance requires physicians performing abortions to "insure that the remains of the unborn child are disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner."  The Court of Appeals found that the word "humane" was impermissibly vague as a definition of conduct subject to criminal prosecution.  The court invalidated the entire provision, declining to sever the word "humane" in order to uphold the requirement that disposal be "sanitary."  <em>See</em> 651 F.2d at 1211.  We affirm this judgment.</p>\n<p>Akron contends that the purpose of \xc2\xa7 1879.16 is simply "<em>to preclude the mindless dumping of aborted fetuses onto garbage piles.\'"  <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Fitzpatrick,</em> 401 F.Supp. 554, 573 (ED Pa.1975) (three-judge court) (quoting State\'s characterization of legislative purpose), <em>summarily aff\'d sub nom. Franklin v. Fitzpatrick,</em> 428 U.S. 901 (1976). [<a href="#F44" name="T44">Footnote 44</a>]  It is far from clear, however, that this provision has such a limited intent.  The phrase "humane and sanitary" does, as the Court of Appeals noted, suggest a possible intent to "mandate some sort of `decent burial\' of an embryo at the earliest stages of formation."  651 F.2d at 1211.  This level of uncertainty is fatal where criminal liability is imposed.  <em>See Colautti v. Franklin, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/case.html#396">439 U. S. 396</a></span>.  Because \xc2\xa7 1879.16 fails to give a physician "fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden," <em><span class="l-italics"><a href="/cases/federal/us/347/612/case.html">United States v.

[<a href="#F45" name="T45">Footnote 45</a>]\n</em></p>\n<p></p><h3>VIII</h3><p></p>\n<p>We affirm the judgment of the Court of Appeals invalidating those sections of Akron\'s "Regulations of Abortions" ordinance that deal with parental consent, informed consent, a 24-hour waiting period, and the disposal of fetal remains.  The remaining portion of the judgment, sustaining Akron\'s requirement that all second trimester abortions be performed in a hospital, is reversed.</p>\n<p><em>It is so ordered.</em></p>\n<p>* Together with No. 81-1172, <em>Akron Center for Reproductive Health, Inc., et al. v. City of Akron et al.,</em> also on certiorari to the same court.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T1" name="F1">Footnote 1</a>]</p>\n<p>There are especially compelling reasons for adhering to <em>stare decisis</em> in applying the principles of <em>Roe v. Wade.</em>  That case was considered with special care.  It was first argued during the 1971 Term, and reargued -- with extensive briefing -- the following Term.  The decision was joined by THE CHIEF JUSTICE and six other Justices.  Since <em>Roe</em> was decided in January, 1973, the Court repeatedly and consistently has accepted and applied the basic principle that a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy.  <em>See Connecticut v.

The dissent stops short of arguing flatly that <em>Roe</em> should be overruled.  Rather, it adopts reasoning that, for all practical purposes, would accomplish precisely that result.  The dissent states that "[e]ven assuming that there is a fundamental right to terminate pregnancy in some situations," the State\'s compelling interests in maternal health and potential human life "are present <em>throughout</em> pregnancy."  <em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#459">462 U. S. 459</a></span> (emphasis in original).  The existence of these compelling interests turns out to be largely unnecessary, however, for the dissent does not think that even one of the numerous abortion regulations at issue imposes a sufficient burden on the "limited" fundamental right, <em>post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#465">462 U. S. 465</a></span>, n. 10, to require heightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the dissent asserts that, regardless of cost,</p>\n<p>"[a] health regulation, such as the hospitalization requirement, simply does not rise to the level of \'official interference\' with the abortion decision."</p>\n<p><em>Post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#467">462 U.

The dissent therefore would hold that a requirement that all abortions be performed in an acute care general hospital does not impose an unacceptable burden on the abortion decision.  It requires no great familiarity with the cost and limited availability of such hospitals to appreciate that the effect of the dissent\'s views would be to drive the performance of many abortions back underground free of effective regulation, and often without the attendance of a physician.</p>\n<p>In sum, it appears that the dissent would uphold virtually any abortion regulation under a rational basis test.  It also appears that even where heightened scrutiny is deemed appropriate, the dissent would uphold virtually any abortion-inhibiting regulation because of the State\'s interest in preserving potential human life.  <em>See post</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#474">462 U.

S. 163</a></span>.  There is substantial evidence that developments in the past decade, particularly the development of a much safer method for performing second trimester abortions, <em>see infra</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#435">462 U. S. 435</a></span>-437, have extended the period in which abortions are safer than childbirth.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> LeBolt, Grimes, &amp; Cates, Mortality From Abortion and Childbirth:  Are the Populations Comparable?, 248 J.A.M.A. 188, 191 (1982) (abortion may be safer than childbirth up to gestational ages of 16 weeks).</p>\n<p>We think it prudent, however, to retain <em>Roe</em>\'s identification of the beginning of the second trimester as the approximate time at which the State\'s interest in maternal health becomes sufficiently compelling to justify significant regulation of abortion.  We note that the medical evidence suggests that, until approximately the end of the first trimester, the State\'s interest in maternal health would not be served by regulations that restrict the manner in which abortions are performed by a licensed physician.  <em>See, e.g.,</em> American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services 54 (5th ed.1982) (hereinafter ACOG Standards) (uncomplicated abortions generally may be performed in a physician\'s office or an outpatient clinic up to 14 weeks from the first day of the last menstrual period); ACOG Technical Bulletin No. 56, Methods of Mid-Trimester Abortion 4 (Dec.1979) ("Regardless of advances in abortion technology, midtrimester terminations will likely remain more hazardous, expensive, and emotionally disturbing for women than earlier abortions").</p>\n<p>The <em>Roe</em> trimester standard thus continues to provide a reasonable legal framework for limiting a State\'s authority to regulate abortions.  Where the State adopts a health regulation governing the performance of abortions during the second trimester, the determinative question should be whether there is a reasonable medical basis for the regulation.  <em>See Roe,</em> 410 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163">410 U.

The comparison between abortion and childbirth mortality rates may be relevant only where the State employs a health rationale as a justification for a complete prohibition on abortions in certain circumstances.  <em>See Danforth, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#78">428 U.

But the issue in this litigation is not whether these clinics would meet such standards if they were prescribed by the city.  Rather, Akron has gone much further by banning all second trimester abortions in all clinics, a regulation that does not reasonably further the city\'s interest in promoting health.  We continue to hold, as we did in <em>Doe v.

Even assuming that the Ohio courts would construe these provisions as permitting a minor to obtain judicial approval for the "proper or necessary . . . medical or surgical care" of an abortion, where her parents had refused to provide that care, the statute makes no provision for a mature or emancipated minor completely to avoid hostile parental involvement by demonstrating to the satisfaction of the court that she is capable of exercising her constitutional right to choose an abortion.  On the contrary, the statute requires that the minor\'s parents be notified once a petition has been filed, \xc2\xa7 2151.28, a requirement that, in the case of a mature minor seeking an abortion, would be unconstitutional.  <em>See H.

Nonetheless, it is apparent from the Court\'s opinion that neither sound constitutional theory nor our need to decide cases based on the application of neutral principles can accommodate an analytical framework that varies according to the "stages" of pregnancy, where those stages, and their concomitant standards of review, differ according to the level of medical technology available when a particular challenge to state regulation occurs.  The Court\'s analysis of the Akron regulations is inconsistent both with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="453">Page 462 U.

S. 454</a></p><p> Court to analyze the regulations in these cases, cannot be supported as a legitimate or useful framework for accommodating the woman\'s right and the State\'s interests.  The decision of the Court today graphically illustrates why the trimester approach is a completely unworkable method of accommodating the conflicting personal rights and compelling state interests that are involved in the abortion context.</p>\n<p>As the Court indicates today, the State\'s compelling interest in maternal health changes as medical technology changes, and any health regulation must not "depart from accepted medical practice."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#431">462 U. S. 431</a></span>. [<a href="#F2/2" name="T2/2">Footnote 2/2</a>]  In applying this standard, the Court holds that "the safety of second trimester abortions has increased dramatically" since 1973, when </p><p><a class="page-number" name="455">Page 462 U.

Although a regulation such as one requiring that all second trimester abortions be performed in hospitals "had strong support" in 1973 "as a reasonable health regulation," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#435">462 U. S. 435</a></span>, this regulation can no longer stand because, according to the Court\'s diligent research into medical and scientific literature, the dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedure, used in 1973 only for first trimester abortions, "is now widely and successfully used for second trimester abortions."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#436">462 U. S. 436</a></span> (footnote omitted).  Further, the medical literature relied on by the Court indicates that the D&amp;E procedure may be performed in an appropriate nonhospital setting for "at least . . . the early weeks of the second trimester. . . ."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#437">462 U. S. 437</a></span>.  The Court then chooses the period of 16 weeks of gestation as that point at which D&amp;E procedures may be performed safely in a nonhospital setting, and thereby invalidates the Akron hospitalization regulation.</p>\n<p>It is not difficult to see that, despite the Court\'s purported adherence to the trimester approach adopted in <em>Roe,</em> the lines drawn in that decision have now been "blurred" because of what the Court accepts as technological advancement in the safety of abortion procedure.  The State may no longer rely on a "bright line" that separates permissible from impermissible regulation, and it is no longer free to consider the second trimester as a unit and weigh the risks posed by all abortion procedures throughout that trimester. [<a href="#F2/3" name="T2/3">Footnote 2/3</a>]  Rather, </p><p><a class="page-number" name="456">Page 462 U. S. 456</a></p><p> the State must continuously and conscientiously study contemporary medical and scientific literature in order to determine whether the effect of a particular regulation is to "depart from accepted medical practice" insofar as particular procedures and particular periods within the trimester are concerned.  Assuming that legislative bodies are able to engage in this exacting task, [<a href="#F2/4" name="T2/4">Footnote 2/4</a>] it is difficult to believe that our Constitution <em>requires</em> that they do it as a prelude to protecting the health of their citizens.  It is even more difficult to believe that this Court, without the resources available to those bodies entrusted with making legislative choices, believes itself competent to make these inquiries and to revise these standards every time the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) or similar group revises its views about what is and what is not appropriate medical procedure in this area.  Indeed, the ACOG Standards on which the Court relies were changed in 1982, after trial in the present cases.  Before ACOG changed its Standards in 1982, it recommended that all mid-trimester abortions be performed in a hospital.  <em>See</em> 651 F.2d 1198, 1209 (CA6 1981).  As today\'s decision indicates, medical technology is changing, and this change will necessitate our continued functioning as the Nation\'s</p>\n<p>"<em>ex officio</em> medical board, with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States."</p>\n<p><em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v.

The 14th edition of L. Hellman &amp; J. Pritchard, Williams Obstetrics (1971), on which the Court relied in <em>Roe</em> for its understanding of viability, stated, at 493, that "[a]ttainment of a [fetal] weight of 1,000 g [or a fetal age of approximately 28 weeks\' gestation] is . . . widely used as the criterion of viability."  However, recent studies have demonstrated increasingly earlier fetal viability. [<a href="#F2/5" name="T2/5">Footnote 2/5</a>]  It is certainly reasonable to believe that fetal viability in the first trimester of pregnancy may be possible in the not too distant future.  Indeed, the Court has explicitly acknowledged that <em>Roe</em> left the point of viability "flexible for anticipated advancements in medical skill."  <em>Colautti v. Franklin,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/439/379/case.html">439 U.

As the medical risks of various abortion procedures decrease, the point at which the State may regulate for reasons of maternal health is moved further forward to actual childbirth.  As medical science becomes better able to provide for the separate existence of the fetus, the point of viability is moved further back toward conception.  Moreover, it is clear that the trimester approach violates the fundamental aspiration of judicial decisionmaking through the application of neutral principles "sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout the community and continuity over significant periods of time. . . ."  A. Cox, The Role of the Supreme Court in American Government 114 (1976).  The <em>Roe</em> framework is inherently tied to the state of medical technology that exists whenever particular litigation ensues.  Although legislatures are better suited to make the necessary factual judgments in this area, the Court\'s framework forces legislatures, as a matter of constitutional law, to speculate about what constitutes "accepted medical practice" at any given time.  Without the necessary expertise or ability, courts must then pretend to act as science review boards and examine those legislative judgments.</p>\n<p>The Court adheres to the <em>Roe</em> framework because the doctrine of <em>stare decisis</em> "demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#420">462 U. S. 420</a></span>.  Although respect for <em>stare decisis</em> cannot be challenged, "this Court\'s considered practice [is] not to apply <em>stare decisis</em> as rigidly in constitutional as in nonconstitutional cases."  <em>Glidden Co. v.

[<a href="#F2/7" name="T2/7">Footnote 2/7</a>]</p>\n<p>The state interest in potential human life is likewise extant throughout pregnancy.

The difficulty with this analysis is clear:  <em>potential</em> life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward.  At any stage in pregnancy, there is the <em>potential</em> for human life.

The choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in <em>potential</em> life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward.  Accordingly, I believe that the State\'s interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy.</p>\n<p></p><h3>III</h3><p></p>\n<p>Although the State possesses compelling interests in the protection of potential human life and in maternal health throughout pregnancy, not every regulation that the State imposes must be measured against the State\'s compelling interests and examined with strict scrutiny.

As the city of Akron points out, there is no evidence in this case to show that the two Akron hospitals that performed second trimester abortions denied an abortion to any woman, or that they would not permit abortion by the D&amp;E procedure.  <em>See</em> Reply Brief for Petitioner in No. 81-746, p. 3.

The city of Akron is merely attempting to ensure that the decision to abort is made in light of that knowledge that the city deems relevant to informed choice.  As such, these regulations do not impermissibly affect any privacy right under the Fourteenth Amendment. [<a href="#F2/16" name="T2/16">Footnote 2/16</a>]</p>\n<p><em>D\n</em></p>\n<p>Section 1870.07 of the Akron ordinance requires a 24-hour waiting period between the signing of a consent form and the actual performance of the abortion, except in cases of emergency.  <em>See</em> \xc2\xa7 1879.12.  The court below invalidated this requirement because it affected abortion decisions during the first trimester of pregnancy.  The Court affirms the decision below, not on the ground that it affects early abortions, but because "Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting </p><p><a class="page-number" name="473">Page 462 U. S. 473</a></p><p> period."  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#450">462 U. S. 450</a></span>.  The Court accepts the arguments made by Akron Center that the waiting period increases the costs of obtaining an abortion by requiring the pregnant woman to make two trips to the clinic, and increases the risks of abortion through delay and scheduling difficulties.  The decision whether to proceed should be left to the physician\'s "<em>discretion in the exercise of his medical judgment.\'"  <em>Ibid.</em> (quoting <em>Colautti,</em> 439 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/329/379/case.html#387">329 U. S. 387</a></span>).\n</em></p>\n<p>It is certainly difficult to understand how the Court believes that the physician-patient relationship is able to accommodate any interest that the State has in maternal physical and mental wellbeing in light of the fact that the record in this case shows that the relationship is nonexistent.  <em>See</em> 651 F.2d at 1217 (Kennedy, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part).  It is also interesting to note that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that,</p>\n<p>"[p]rior to abortion, the woman should have access to special counseling that explores options for the management of an unwanted pregnancy, examines the risks, and allows sufficient time for reflection prior to making an informed decision."</p>\n<p>1982 ACOG Standards for Obstetric-Gynecologic Services at 54.</p>\n<p>The waiting period does not apply in cases of medical emergency.  Therefore, should the physician determine that the waiting period would increase risks significantly, he or she need not require the woman to wait.  The Court\'s concern in this respect is simply misplaced.  Although the waiting period may impose an additional cost on the abortion decision, this increased cost does not unduly burden the availability of abortions or impose an absolute obstacle to access to abortions.  Further, the State is not required to "fine-tune" its abortion statutes so as to minimize the costs of abortions.  <em>H. L. v. Matheson,</em> 450 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/450/398/case.html#413">450 U.

S. 474</a></p><p> health and protection of fetal life clearly justify the waiting period.  As we acknowledged in <em>Danforth,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U. S. 67</a></span>, the decision to abort is "a stressful one," and the waiting period reasonably relates to the State\'s interest in ensuring that a woman does not make this serious decision in undue haste.  The decision also has grave consequences for the fetus, whose life the State has a compelling interest to protect and preserve.  "[N]o other [medical] procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life."  <em>Harris,</em> 448 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/448/297/case.html#325">448 U.

The waiting period is surely a small cost to impose to ensure that the woman\'s decision is well considered in light of its certain and irreparable consequences on fetal life, and the possible effects on her own.

I disagree.</p>\n<p>In <em>Planned Parenthood Assn. v. Fitzpatrick,</em> 401 F.Supp. 554 (ED Pa.1975) (three-judge court), <em>summarily aff\'d sub nom. Franklin v. Fitzpatrick,</em> 428 U.S. 901 (1976), the District Court upheld a "humane disposal" provision against a vagueness attack in light of the State\'s representation that the intent of the Act "<em>is to preclude the mindless dumping of </em></p><p><em><a class="page-number" name="475">Page 462 U.

The District Court held that different concerns would be implicated if the statute were, at some point, determined to require "expensive burial."  <em>Ibid.</em>  In the present cases, the city of Akron has informed this Court that the intent of the "humane" portion of its statute, as distinguished from the "sanitary" portion, is merely to ensure that fetuses will not be "`dump[ed] . . . on garbage piles.\'"  Brief for Petitioner in No. 81-746, p. 48.  In light of the fact that the city of Akron indicates no intent to require that physicians provide "decent burials" for fetuses, and that "humane" is no more vague than the term "sanitary," the vagueness of which Akron Center does not question, I cannot conclude that the statute is void for vagueness.\n</em></p>\n<p>For the reasons set forth above, I dissent from the judgment of the Court in these cases.</p>\n<p>[<a href="#T2/1" name="F2/1">Footnote 2/1</a>]</p>\n<p><em>Roe</em> recognized that the State possesses important and legitimate interests in protecting maternal health and the potentiality of human life.

Based on the Court\'s review of the contemporary medical literature, it placed viability at about 28 weeks, but acknowledged that this point may occur as early as 24 weeks.  After viability is reached, the State may, according to <em>Roe,</em> proscribe abortion altogether, except when it is necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother.  <em>See id.</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/410/113/case.html#163">410 U.

Even though the Court did not explicitly use the "unduly burdensome" standard in evaluating the informed consent requirement in <em>Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth, supra,</em> the informed consent requirement for first trimester abortions in <em>Danforth</em> was upheld because it did not "unduly burde[n] the right to seek an abortion."  <em>Bellotti I, supra,</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/132/case.html#147">428 U.

The Court also invalidated a hospital accreditation requirement, a hospital committee approval requirement, and a two-doctor concurrence requirement.  The Court clearly based its disapproval of these requirements on the fact that the State did not impose them on any other medical procedure apart from abortion.  But the Court subsequent to <em>Doe</em> has expressly rejected the view that differential treatment of abortion requires invalidation of regulations.  <em>See Danforth,</em> 428 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/428/52/case.html#67">428 U.

The "unduly burdensome" standard is appropriate not because it incorporates deference to legislative judgment at the threshold stage of analysis, but rather because of the limited <em>nature</em> of the fundamental right that has been recognized in the abortion cases.  Although our cases do require that we "pay careful attention" to the legislative judgment before we invoke strict scrutiny, <em>see e.g, Columbia Broadcasting System, Inc. v. Democratic National Committee,</em> 412 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/412/94/case.html#103">412 U.

S. 155</a></span>, but the Court never actually adopted this standard in the <em>Roe</em> analysis.  In its decision today, the Court fully endorses the <em>Roe</em> requirement that a burdensome health regulation, or as the Court appears to call it, a "significant obstacle," <em>ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#434">462 U.

Nevertheless, the Court fails to apply the "reasonably related" standard.  The hospitalization requirement "reasonably relates" to its compelling interest in protection and preservation of maternal health under any normal understanding of what "reasonably relates" signifies.</p>\n<p>The Court concludes that the regulation must fall because "it appears that during a substantial portion of the second trimester the State\'s regulation <em>depart[s] from accepted medical practice.\'"  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#434">462 U.

It is difficult to see how the Court concludes that the regulation "depart[s] from accepted medical practice" during "a substantial portion of the second trimester," <em>ibid.,</em> in light of the fact that the Court concludes that D&amp;E abortions may be performed safely in an outpatient clinic through 16 weeks, or 4 weeks into the second trimester.  <em>Ante</em> at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/462/416/case.html#436">462 U.

Although the plurality opinion of JUSTICE POWELL in <em>Bellotti II</em> suggested that the state statute in that case was unconstitutional because, <em>inter alia,</em> it failed to provide <em>all</em> minors with an opportunity "to go directly to a court without first consulting or notifying her parents," 443 U.S. at  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/443/622/case.html#647">443 U.
