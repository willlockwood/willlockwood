The defendant by plea set up that a conveyance of the land had been made to the Pennsylvania corporation collusively, and for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction on the circuit court.  The court was of opinion that the allegations of the plea were sustained, and dismissed the action for want of jurisdiction.  The plaintiff duly excepted and the exceptions were allowed and signed.  The plaintiff then prayed for a writ of error to this Court upon the question of jurisdiction, and a writ was allowed "as prayed for" at the same term of court.

J. Kelly, Jr., and others, tenants and lessees of Kelly, to recover the land described in the declaration.  The defense pleaded not guilty, and also filed two pleas to the jurisdiction of the court.  These pleas averred that, for ten years prior to the commencement of the action in ejectment, the Virginia Coal and Iron Company, a corporation existing under the laws of Virginia and a citizen of Virginia, had been claiming title to the lands of the defendant Kelly described in the declaration; that immediately preceding the commencement of the action, the Virginia Coal and Iron Company, its stockholders, officers, and members, organized, under the laws of the State of Pennsylvania, the Lehigh Mining and Manufacturing Company, to which the Virginia Company conveyed said land, in order to enable the Lehigh Company to institute suit in the circuit court, said Lehigh Company being simply another name for the Virginia Company, being composed of the same parties, and organized alone for the purpose of taking a conveyance of the land from the Virginia Company, and the Virginia Company making the conveyance, fraudulently and collusively, for the purpose of conferring jurisdiction on the circuit court.  Issue was joined upon the pleas, and on the 30th day of May, 1894, was tried by the court, Hon. John Paul, District Judge, holding the circuit court, presiding, upon an agreed statement of facts which recited, among other things, that the Lehigh Company in the month of February, 1893, was organized under the laws of Pennsylvania by the individual stockholders and officers of the Virginia Company, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of Virginia and a citizen </p><p><a class="page-number" name="324">Page 156 U.

This bill of exceptions contained the two pleas and the agreed statement of facts, and declared that the court</p>\n<p>"held that the court did not have jurisdiction of this suit, and ordered the same to be dismissed, to which opinion and action of the court the plaintiff did then and there except."</p>\n<p>The plaintiff thereupon prayed for a writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States, which was allowed by the following order, under the hand of the district judge, and entered of record:</p>\n<p>"The plaintiff, considering itself aggrieved by the rulings of said court in the said case, in which final judgment was rendered at the May term, 1894, to-wit, on May 30, 1894, of said circuit court held at this place, dismissing the said case because the said court, in its opinion, did not have jurisdiction thereof, and having on the thirtieth day of May, 1894, filed its bill of exceptions, and having on this day filed its assignment of errors and its petition praying for a writ of error to said judgment and proceedings to the Supreme Court of the United States upon the said question of jurisdiction, and praying that said writ of error be allowed it to the said Supreme Court of the United States, and that a full transcript of the record and proceedings in said cause, duly authenticated, be sent to said supreme court."</p>\n<p>"Now, on this day, to-wit, May 30, 1894, it is ordered and considered by this Court that said writ of error be allowed and awarded as prayed for. . . ."</p>\n<p>On November 23, 1894 at a subsequent term of the court to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="326">Page 156 U.

CHIEF JUSTICE FULLER, after stating the facts in the foregoing language, delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>In <em>Maynard v. Hecht,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/151/324/case.html">151 U. S. 324</a></span>, we held that in the instance of an appeal or writ of error from a circuit court upon the question of jurisdiction under the fifth section of the Judiciary Act of March 3, 1891, a certificate by the circuit court presenting such question for determination was required in order to invoke the exercise by this Court of its appellate jurisdiction.  The first of the six classes of cases described in that section in which a writ of error or appeal could be taken or brought directly to this Court from the circuit courts was:</p>\n<p>"In any case in which the jurisdiction of the court is in issue; in such case, the question of jurisdiction alone shall be certified </p><p><a class="page-number" name="327">Page 156 U. S. 327</a></p><p> to the Supreme Court from the court below for decision."</p>\n<p>We were of opinion that the intention of Congress as to the certification mentioned in that section, and also in section 6, in relation to the circuit court of appeals, was to be arrived at in the light of the rules theretofore prevailing in reference to certificates on division of opinion.  Rev.Stat. \xc2\xa7\xc2\xa7 650-652, 693, 697.  In reference to such certificates, it was provided that the point on which the disagreement occurred should be certified during the trial term, and it is argued that by analogy the certificate of the circuit courts, under the Act of March 3, 1891, must also be made at the term at which the final judgment or decree is entered, and, moreover, that as, after the close of such term, the parties are out of court and the litigation there at an end, the court has no power to grant such certificate, and cannot certify, <em>nunc pro tunc,</em> if no such certificate was made or intended to be made at the term, as was the case here.  But it is unnecessary to determine how this may be, as we think the district judge was quite right in holding that the question had already been sufficiently certified.  The question involved was only the question of jurisdiction, and the judgment not only recited that for reasons in writing, filed as part of the order, the court considered that it had no jurisdiction of the case, and therefore dismissed it for want of jurisdiction; but the district judge certified in the bill of exceptions that it was "held that the court did not have jurisdiction of the suit, and ordered the same to be dismissed," and, in the order allowing the writ of error, certified in effect that it was allowed "upon the question of jurisdiction."</p>\n<p>We observed in <em>United States v. Jahn,</em> <span class="l-leftover"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/109/case.html">155 U. S. 109</a></span>,  <span class="l-normaldigitafter"><a href="/cases/federal/us/155/109/case.html#112">155 U. S. 112</a></span>, that</p>\n<p>"the provision that any case in which the question of jurisdiction is in issue may be taken directly to this Court necessarily extends to other cases than those in which the final judgment rests on the ground of want of jurisdiction, for in them that would be the sole question, and the certificate, though requisite to our jurisdiction under the statute, would not be, in itself, essential, however valuable in the interest of brevity of record.  But in such other cases, the requirement that the question of  </p><p><a class="page-number" name="328">Page 156 U. S. 328</a></p><p> jurisdiction alone should be certified for decision was intended to operate as a limitation upon the jurisdiction of this Court of the entire case, and of all questions involved in it -- a jurisdiction which can be exercised in any other class of cases taken directly to this Court, under section five."</p>\n<p>If in this case the jurisdiction had been sustained, and the defendants had preserved the question by certificate in the form of a bill of exceptions, and the cause had subsequently proceeded to a final decree against them, it would seem that they could have brought the case at the proper time, on the question of jurisdiction solely, directly to this Court, although not compelled to do so.</p>\n<p>At all events, where the question is certified as it was here, we think the requisition of the statute sufficiently complied with.</p>\n<p><em>Leave denied.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
