S. 235</a></p><p></p>\n<p>MR. CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL delivered the opinion of the Court as follows:</p>\n<p>At the opening of this case, some doubt was entertained respecting the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, but that doubt is removed by an inspection of the act by which the Circuit Court of the District of Columbia is constituted.  The words of that act, descriptive of the appellate jurisdiction of this Court, are more ample than those employed in the Judicial Act.  They are that</p>\n<p>"Any final judgment, order, or decree in said circuit court wherein the matter in dispute, exclusive of costs, shall exceed the value of $100 may be reexamined and reversed or affirmed in the Supreme Court."</p>\n<p>The jurisdiction of this Court being admitted, the proceedings of the circuit court in ordering the inquisition </p><p><a class="page-number" name="236">Page 10 U. S. 236</a></p><p> taken between these parties to be quashed comes on to be examined.</p>\n<p>The first objection to this proceeding is that the court of Alexandria could take no cognizance of the subject by way of motion.</p>\n<p>The validity of this objection depends entirely on the act of Congress under which this inquisition was taken.  If it was to be recorded by order of the court, if the judgment of the court was in any manner to be exercised upon it, then in all which has been done the court has exercised its jurisdiction, and the inquiry will be whether there was sufficient cause for refusing to permit the inquisition to be recorded.  If, on the other hand, the clerk was a mere ministerial officer directed, by law to perform a ministerial act, without any superintending agency on the part of the court, then the court could not, upon motion, prohibit the clerk to perform his duty, and could not legitimately quash the inquisition.</p>\n<p>The act of Congress directs</p>\n<p>"that the inquisition, when taken, shall be signed by the marshal and by the jurymen present and returned by the marshal to the clerk of the county, to be by him recorded."</p>\n<p>That the legislature may direct the clerk of a court to perform a specified service without making his act the act of the court will not be controverted, and if this may be done, it is difficult to conceive words which convey this idea more clearly than those which are employed in this act.</p>\n<p>The inquisition is not returnable to the court, but to the clerk.  It is not to be recorded by order of the court, but is to be recorded by the clerk, on receiving it from the marshal.  It does not derive its validity from being recorded, but remains afterwards liable to all the objections which might be taken to it previous thereto.  If, for example, an inquisition should be recorded which was found by eleven jurors, that inquisition would neither vest the land in the company nor give a right to </p><p><a class="page-number" name="237">Page 10 U. S. 237</a></p><p> the former proprietor to demand the money to which it was valued.  The inquisition, then, is to be recorded solely for preservation, and the act of recording is a ministerial act which the law directs the clerk to perform, without submitting the paper to the judgment of the court.  The law asks not the intervention of the court, and requires no exercise of judicial functions.</p>\n<p>The difference between this act and those the execution of which is superintended by the court is apparent.  In those cases, the instrument is to be brought into court and acted upon by the court; in this it is to be delivered to the clerk at any time, and acted on by him without the intervention of the court.</p>\n<p>This Court is unanimously of opinion that the Circuit Court for the County of Alexandria could not legally entertain the motion for quashing the inquisition found in this case, nor legally prevent their clerk from recording it.  Their judgment therefore is</p>\n<p><em>Reversed and the motion to be dismissed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
