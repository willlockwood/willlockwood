The facts proved were, that William, the plaintiff, had attained the age of 21 years; that he was the younger son of the testator\'s deceased daughter, who had been married to Samuel Powell, the carpenter, named in the will; that he was well known to the testator; and that the testator usually, by mistake, or by way of nickname, called him Samuel; but that Samuel Powell, the carpenter, had another son, a mason, whose name was actually Samuel, the issue of a second marriage, and with whom the testator had no connection, or acquaintance, whatever. </p><p> On arguing the motion for a new trial, by Ingersoll for the plaintiff, and Mifflin for the defendant, it was agreed on both sides, that the misnomer was merely a mistake; but nevertheless it was contended for the defendant, that the evidence to prove it, ought not to have been admitted; for, whatever might be the diversity of decisions under other circumstances, it was alledged, that in no instance had a legacy been awarded contrary to the express designation of the will, when a person of the name and description of the legatee existed, capable of taking the bequest.

Suppose a man were to live many years under a fictitious name, which happened to be the real name of another person in the same community, could he not take a legacy under the fictitious name? Could he not, likewise, take it, after assuming his proper name? And if so, does not the claim depend on a fact dehors the will, which must be established by independent proof? The present dispute, in the same manner, resolves itself into this question, whether evidence may not be given, in the case of two persons of the same family, one called William, and the other called Samuel, that the testator knew the latter, though he did not know the former? And, consequently, that the legacy given by a mistake of names to the person he did not know, was intended, in fact, for the person he did know, who in the bequest is emphatically called his friend? It is admitted, from the authorities cited by the opposite counsel, that where there is not a person of the name mentioned in the will, explanatory evidence may be given of the testator\'s intention; and that if Samuel had not existed, William might have enjoyed the benefit of the legacy under Samuel\'s name. But the principle extends further than that admission; and as between William and the testator, an obvious mistake ought not to be enforced against all the truth and justice of the case. In P. Wm. 141. both the christian name and sir-name of the legatee were mistaken; and there were other persons capable of taking the legacy; yet the decree was favorable to the party intended, though not designated, by the bequest. All the authorities, indeed, concur in that point, that no injury can arise from admitting parol proof to ascertain the thing, or person, described by the testator. Rich.

The bequest was made to a person who was always called Samuel by the testator, though, in fact, named William; and whom the testator had nurtured and educated from his infancy; when, on the other hand, he did not even know the person really called Samuel. The evidence to explain those facts was proper to be laid before the jury; and their verdict perfectly accords with the law and equity of the case. Therefore, </p><p> Let the Rule be discharged.\n                                                    </p></span></div>\n</div>\n</font></div>'
