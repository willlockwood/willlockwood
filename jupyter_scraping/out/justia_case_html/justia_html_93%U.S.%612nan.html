JUSTICE DAVIS delivered the opinion of the Court.</p>\n<p>This suit involves the interpretation of the contract between the City of Winona and the Minnesota Railway Construction Company bearing date April 23, 1870.  It was brought on certain coupons which were attached to the bonds whereof mention is made in that contract and delivered by the depositary to the company after one-half of them in number and value were overdue.  They were received by the plaintiff below after their maturity and before the commencement of this suit.</p>\n<p>The company stipulated that within three years from that date, it would build, equip, and put in operation in its own name or that of its successors and assigns or of the St. Paul &amp; Chicago Railway Company a good and substantial railway from St. Paul to Winona (excepting a bridge across the Mississippi River at Hastings) and connect at Winona by bridge or ferry with the La Crosse, Trempealeau &amp; Prescott Railroad; that a part of said railway between certain points specifically mentioned should be completed and put in operation within one year, and that the La Crosse, Trempealeau &amp; Prescott Railroad, from its terminus opposite Winona, should be put in operation to a point on the Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway east of north La Crosse within the year 1870. </p><p><a class="page-number" name="617">Page 93 U. S. 617</a></p><p></p>\n<p>It was only by performing the stipulated conditions within the designated periods that the company could acquire a valid title to these evidences of indebtedness.  In no case was any part of them to be delivered until a truss railroad bridge should be constructed across the Mississippi River at Winona, connecting the St. Paul &amp; Chicago Railway, or the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad, with the La Crosse, Trempealeau &amp; Prescott Railroad, at the then terminus of the latter.</p>\n<p>These are the leading provisions of the contract.  Its preamble recites that the construction of a railroad from St. Paul to Winona is of great public utility and particularly advantageous to the latter city, and discloses that the controlling inducement for furnishing the promised aid to the company is to secure an unbroken line of travel by railroad between the East and West through Winona.</p>\n<p>The depositary in whose hands the bonds and coupons were placed delivered them to the construction company March 27, 1872, after the road had been built from St. Paul to the western limits of Winona and its track connected there with that of the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad.</p>\n<p>The liability of the city of pay these coupons is denied chiefly upon the ground that there was not such a compliance with the contract by the construction company as would entitle it to the possession of them.</p>\n<p>The bill of exceptions shows that evidence was given tending to prove that the roads and parts of road mentioned in the contract had been respectively constructed, equipped, and put in operation within the appointed time, and the verdict of the jury is conclusive upon the questions of fact involved in the issue.</p>\n<p>The exceptions to the charge of the court do not each require a special or extended consideration.  At the date of the contract, the construction company had, for a certain consideration, agreed with the St. Paul &amp; Chicago company to construct and equip its road between Chicago and St. Paul and obtain the necessary right of way.  It was to receive all gifts, bounties, or aids that might be given by any corporation or municipality to aid in building the projected road.  The railroad company sold its road Jan. 3, 1872, to the Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway </p><p><a class="page-number" name="618">Page 93 U. S. 618</a></p><p> Company, and the latter was properly held by the court below to be the successor of the construction company within the meaning of the contract.  That part of the road which was to be completed within twelve months was equipped and put in operation by the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad Company under a contract with the Chicago and St. Paul Railroad Company, with the assent and approval of the construction company.  In our opinion, the court below correctly held that constructing, equipping, and putting in operation the road between St. Paul and Winona by the construction company, the St. Paul &amp; Chicago company, or the assignees of either, was in that regard a sufficient compliance with the contract.</p>\n<p>The remaining charge to which exception was taken relates to the connection of the road from St. Paul with the track of the St. Peter Railway within the limits of Winona.  The court instructed that a connection of the track of the last-named railway with the railroad bridge across the river at Winona -- said bridge connecting with the La Crosse Railroad at the point named in the contract -- was a connection by bridge or ferry within the meaning of that contract if, after the purchase of the St. Paul &amp; Chicago Railroad by the Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railroad Company, the latter company continued to run its cars over the railroad bridge and the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad within the limits of the city.</p>\n<p>It is contended that building the railway from St. Paul to the western limit of Winona and uniting it there with the Winona &amp; St. Peter road at a point more than a mile west of the west end of the bridge connecting the latter road with the La Crosse Railroad, was not, in the just sense of the term, a connecting of the road from St. Paul by bridge with the La Crosse Railroad, within the meaning or purview of the contract.</p>\n<p>The contract, as we construe it, stipulates that the contemplated connection may be made by means of the Winona &amp; St. Peter Railroad.  One of its early provisions declares that the connection between the St. Paul and the La Crosse roads at Winona shall be by means of a bridge or ferry; but a subsequent one is express, that the bonds shall not be delivered until the bridge is constructed across the river at Winona, connecting the St. Paul Railway or the Winona &amp; St. Peter road with </p><p><a class="page-number" name="619">Page 93 U. S. 619</a></p><p> the La Crosse road at the then terminus of the latter.  It was therefore optional with the construction company to build the St. Paul Railway over the bridge, and form an actual junction with the La Crosse road; or to build it to any point in the city, and make the required connection by means of the Winona &amp; St. Peter road.  Either of these modes would secure the object desired by the city -- an uninterrupted communication by rail from St. Paul across the river at Winona to the eastern seaboard.</p>\n<p>It is contended that the contract is against public policy and without consideration.  The obvious answer is that it was expressly sanctioned by an act of the legislature of the state, and was designed to insure and expedite the construction of works of internal improvement deemed of vital importance to the material interests of the city.  Whether it be expedient to invest municipal corporations with authority to aid in building railways, is a question foreign to the present inquiry; but where, as in this instance, it has been conferred and exercised, and the city has secured the advantages of the contract, the law will not suffer her to escape from its obligations.</p>\n<p><em>Judgment affirmed.</em></p>\n</span></div>\n</div>\n</div>'
