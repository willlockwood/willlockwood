In November 2010, Musacchio was indicted under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71030(a)(2)(C), which makes it a crime if a person \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally accesses a computer without authorization <i>or</i> exceeds authorized access\xe2\x80\x9d and thereby \xe2\x80\x9cobtains .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information from any protected computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  He was charged in count 1 with conspiring to commit both types of improper access and in count 23 with making unauthorized access \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about\xe2\x80\x9d November 24, 2005.  In a 2012 superseding indictment, count 1 dropped the charge of conspiracy to exceed authorized access, and count 2 changed count 23\xe2\x80\x99s date to \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about\xe2\x80\x9d November 23\xe2\x80\x9325, 2005.  Musacchio never argued in the trial court that his prosecution violated the 5-year statute of limitations applicable to count 2.  See \xc2\xa73282(a).  At trial, the Government did not object when the District Court instructed the jury that \xc2\xa71030(a)(2)(C) \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it a crime .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. to intentionally access a computer without authorization <i>and</i> exceed authorized access\xe2\x80\x9d (emphasis added), even though the conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d added an additional element.  The jury found Musacchio guilty on counts 1 and 2.  On appeal, he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conspiracy conviction and argued, for the first time, that his prosecution on count 2 was barred by \xc2\xa73282(a)\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  In affirming his conviction, the Fifth Circuit assessed Musacchio\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency challenge against the charged elements of the conspiracy count rather than against the heightened jury instruction, and it concluded that he had waived his statute-of-limitations defense by failing to raise it at trial.</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-E"><i>Held</i>:</p>\n<p style="p-SYLCT-F">1.\xc2\xa0A sufficiency challenge should be assessed against the elements of the charged crime, not against the elements set forth in an erroneous jury instruction.  Sufficiency review essentially addresses whether the Government\xe2\x80\x99s case was strong enough to reach the jury.  A reviewing court conducts a limited inquiry tailored to ensuring that a defendant receives the minimum required by due process: a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to defend\xe2\x80\x9d against the charge against him and a jury finding of guilt \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n\xe2\x80\x93315.

A reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s determination thus does not rest on how the jury was instructed.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to introduce evidence of an additional element does not implicate these principles, and its failure to object to a heightened jury instruction does not affect sufficiency review.  Because Musacchio does not dispute that he was properly charged with conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access or that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the charged crime, the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected his sufficiency challenge.

We address two questions arising from the parties\xe2\x80\x99 failures to raise timely challenges.  We first consider how a court should assess a challenge to the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case when a jury instruction adds an element to the charged crime and the Government fails to object.  We conclude that the sufficiency of the evidence should be assessed against the elements of the charged crime.  We next consider whether the statute-of-limitations defense contained in\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73282(a) (the general federal criminal statute of limitations) may be successfully raised for the first time on appeal.  We conclude that it may not be.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">I</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Petitioner Michael Musacchio served as president of a logistics company, Exel Transportation Services (ETS), until his resignation in 2004.  In 2005, he formed a rival company, Total Transportation Services (TTS).  Musacchio was soon joined there by Roy Brown, who previouslyheaded ETS\xe2\x80\x99s information-technology department.  At TTS, Brown, using a password, continued to access ETS\xe2\x80\x99s computer system without ETS\xe2\x80\x99s authorization.  Brown also gave Musacchio access to ETS\xe2\x80\x99s system.  This improper access of ETS\xe2\x80\x99s system kept on until early 2006.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In November 2010, a grand jury indicted Musacchio under\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa71030(a)(2)(C).  Under that provision, a person commits a crime when he \xe2\x80\x9cintentionally accesses a computer without authorization <i>or</i> exceeds authorized access,\xe2\x80\x9d and in doing so \xe2\x80\x9cobtains .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. information from any protected computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  (Emphasis added.)  The statute thus provides two ways of committing the crime of improperly accessing a protected computer: (1)\xc2\xa0obtaining access without authorization; and (2)\xc2\xa0obtaining access with authorization but then using that access improperly.  See <i>ibid.</i>; \xc2\xa71030(e)(6) (defining \xe2\x80\x9cexceeds authorized access\xe2\x80\x9d).  Count 1 of the indictment charged Musacchio with conspiring to commit both types of improper access.  Count 23 charged him with making unauthorized access to ETS\xe2\x80\x99s e-mail server \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about\xe2\x80\x9d November 24, 2005.  App. 70\xe2\x80\x9371.[<a href="#F1" name="T1">1</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In 2012, the Government filed a superseding indictment amending those charges.  Count 1 dropped the charge of conspiracy to exceed authorized access, limiting that charge to conspiracy to make unauthorized access.  Count 2 amended the allegations originally contained in count 23 by alleging that Musacchio accessed specific ETS e-mail accounts \xe2\x80\x9c[o]n or about\xe2\x80\x9d November 23\xe2\x80\x9325, 2005.  <i>Id.,</i> at 83\xe2\x80\x9384.  The Government later filed a second superseding indictment that made no changes relevant here.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Musacchio proceeded to a jury trial.  At no time before or during trial did he argue that his prosecution violated the 5-year statute of limitations applicable to count 2.  See\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73282(a) (providing general 5-year statute of limitations).</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">For the Government\xe2\x80\x99s part, it submitted proposed jury instructions on the conspiracy count before and during the trial.  Each set of proposed instructions identified that count as involving \xe2\x80\x9cUnauthorized Access to Protected Computer[s],\xe2\x80\x9d and none required the jury additionally to find that Musacchio conspired to exceed authorized access to protected computers.  Musacchio did not propose instructions on the conspiracy count.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Diverging from the indictment and the proposed instructions, the District Court instructed the jury on count 1 that \xc2\xa71030(a)(2)(C) \xe2\x80\x9cmakes it a crime for a person to intentionally access a computer without authorization <i>and</i> exceed authorized access.\xe2\x80\x9d  App. 168 (emphasis added).  The parties agree that this instruction was erroneous: By using the conjunction \xe2\x80\x9cand\xe2\x80\x9d when referring to both ways of violating \xc2\xa71030(a)(2)(C), the instruction required the Government to prove an additional element.  Yet the Government did not object to this error in the instructions.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The jury found Musacchio guilty on both counts 1 and 2.  The District Court sentenced him to 60 months\xe2\x80\x99 imprisonment.  Musacchio appealed, making the two challenges that he again advances in this Court.  First, he challenged the sufficiency of the evidence supporting his conspiracy conviction on count 1.  He maintained, moreover, that the sufficiency of the evidence should be assessed against the erroneous jury instruction that included the additional element.  Second, he argued, for the first time, that his prosecution on count 2\xe2\x80\x94for unauthorized access\xe2\x80\x94was barred by the 5-year statute of limitations because the superseding indictment was filed seven years after the crime and did not relate back to the timely originalindictment.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit rejected both challenges and affirmed Musacchio\xe2\x80\x99s conviction.  590 Fed. Appx. 359 (2014) (\xc2\xa0<i>per curiam</i>).  First, the Court of Appeals concluded that it should assess Musacchio\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency challenge against the charged elements of the conspiracy count, not against the erroneous jury instruction.  See <i>id.,</i> at 362\xe2\x80\x93363.  Under Fifth Circuit precedent, the court explained, erroneously heightened jury instructions generally become the binding \xe2\x80\x9claw of the case\xe2\x80\x9d on appeal.  <i>Id.,</i> at 362 (internal quotation marks omitted).  Circuit precedent supplies an exception, however, when (1) the jury instruction is \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98patently erroneous,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d and (2) \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98the issue is not misstated in the indictment.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States</i> v. <i>Guevara</i>, 408 F.\xc2\xa03d 252, 258 (CA5 2005)).  The Fifth Circuit concluded that those conditions for applying the exception were satisfied.  See 590 Fed. Appx<i>.,</i> at 362\xe2\x80\x93363.  The court explained that the instruction\xe2\x80\x99s requirement of an additional element was \xe2\x80\x9can obvious clerical error,\xe2\x80\x9d and that the indictment correctly charged Musacchio only with \xe2\x80\x9cConspiracy To Make Unauthorized Access to [a] Protected Computer.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.,</i> at 362.  Therefore, the Fifth Circuit did not assess Musacchio\xe2\x80\x99s sufficiency challenge under the heightened jury instruction.  <i>Id.,</i> at 362\xe2\x80\x93363.  Because Musacchio did not dispute that the evidence was sufficient to support a conviction under the elements set out in the indictment, the Fifth Circuit rejected his challenge.  <i>Id.,</i> at 363.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Second, the Fifth Circuit rejected Musacchio\xe2\x80\x99s statute-of-limitations defense, concluding that he had \xe2\x80\x9cwaived\xe2\x80\x9d the defense by failing to raise it at trial.  <i>Id.</i>, at 363, 364.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">We granted certiorari to resolve two questions that have divided the lower courts.  576 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___ (2015).  The first question is whether the sufficiency of the evidence in a criminal case should be measured against the elements described in the jury instructions where those instructions, without objection, require the Government to prove more elements than do the statute and indictment.  Compare, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Romero</i>, 136 F.\xc2\xa03d 1268, 1272\xe2\x80\x931273 (CA10 1998) (explaining that sufficiency is measured against heightened jury instructions), with <i>Guevara</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 258 (CA5) (adopting an exception to that rule).  The second question is whether a statute-of-limitations defense not raised at or before trial is reviewable on appeal.  Compare, <i>e.g., United States</i> v. <i>Franco-Santiago</i>, 681 F.\xc2\xa03d 1, 12, and n.\xc2\xa018 (CA1 2012) (limitations defense not raised and preserved before or at trial is reviewable on appeal for plain error), with <i>United States</i> v. <i>Walsh</i>, 700 F.\xc2\xa02d 846, 855\xe2\x80\x93856 (CA2 1983) (limitations defense not properly raised below is not reviewable on appeal).</p>\n<p style="p-H1">II</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We first address how a court should assess a sufficiency challenge when a jury instruction adds an element to the charged crime and the Government fails to object.  We hold that, when a jury instruction sets forth all the elements of the charged crime but incorrectly adds one more element, a sufficiency challenge should be assessed against the elements of the charged crime, not against the erroneously heightened command in the jury instruction.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">That conclusion flows from the nature of a court\xe2\x80\x99s task in evaluating a sufficiency-of-the-evidence challenge.  Sufficiency review essentially addresses whether \xe2\x80\x9cthe government\xe2\x80\x99s case was so lacking that it should not have even been submitted to the jury.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Burks</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n437 U.\xc2\xa0S. 1,\n16 (1978)\n (emphasis deleted).  On sufficiency review, a reviewing court makes a limited inquiry tailored to ensure that a defendant receives the minimum that due process requires: a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to defend\xe2\x80\x9d against the charge against him and a jury finding of guilt \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Jackson</i> v. <i>Virginia</i>,\n\n443 U.\xc2\xa0S. 307\n\xe2\x80\x93315 (1979).  The reviewing court considers only the \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d question \xe2\x80\x9cwhether, after viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the prosecution, <i>any</i> rational trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 319 (emphasis in original).  That limited review does not intrude on the jury\xe2\x80\x99s role \xe2\x80\x9cto resolve conflicts in the testimony, to weigh the evidence, and to draw reasonable inferences from basic facts to ultimate facts.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Ibid.</i></p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A reviewing court\xe2\x80\x99s limited determination on sufficiency review thus does not rest on how the jury was instructed.  When a jury finds guilt after being instructed on all elements of the charged crime plus one more element, the jury has made all the findings that due process requires.  If a jury instruction requires the jury to find guilt on the elements of the charged crime, a defendant will have had a \xe2\x80\x9cmeaningful opportunity to defend\xe2\x80\x9d against the charge.  <i>Id., </i>at 314.  And if the jury instruction requires the jury to find those elements \xe2\x80\x9cbeyond a reasonable doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d the defendant has been accorded the procedure that this Court has required to protect the presumption of innocence.  <i>Id.,</i> at 314\xe2\x80\x93315.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to introduce evidence of an additional element does not implicate the principles that sufficiency review protects.  All that a defendant is entitled to on a sufficiency challenge is for the court to make a \xe2\x80\x9clegal\xe2\x80\x9d determination whether the evidence was strong enough to reach a jury at all.  <i>Id.,</i> at 319.  The Government\xe2\x80\x99s failure to object to the heightened jury instruction thus does not affect the court\xe2\x80\x99s review for sufficiency of the evidence.[<a href="#F2" name="T2">2</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Musacchio does not contest that the indictment here properly charged him with the statutory elements for conspiracy to obtain unauthorized access.  The jury instructions required the jury to find all of the elements of that charged offense beyond a reasonable doubt.  Nor does he dispute that the evidence was sufficient to convict him of the crime charged in the indictment\xe2\x80\x94of conspiring to make unauthorized access.  Accordingly, the Fifth Circuit correctly rejected his sufficiency challenge.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The Fifth Circuit erred, however, in basing that conclusion on the law-of-the-case doctrine.  See 590 Fed. Appx., at 362\xe2\x80\x93363.  That doctrine does not apply here.  The law-of-the-case doctrine generally provides that \xe2\x80\x9c\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x98when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Pepper</i> v. <i>United States</i>,\n\n562 U.\xc2\xa0S. 476,\n506 (2011)\n (quoting <i>Arizona </i>v. <i>California</i>,\n\n460 U.\xc2\xa0S. 605,\n618 (1983)\n).  The doctrine \xe2\x80\x9cexpresses the practice of courts generally to refuse to reopen what has been decided,\xe2\x80\x9d but it does not \xe2\x80\x9climit [courts\xe2\x80\x99] power.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Messenger</i> v. <i>Anderson</i>,\n\n225 U.\xc2\xa0S. 436,\n444 (1912)\n.  Thus, the doctrine may describe an appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s decision not to depart from a ruling that it made in a prior appeal in the same case.  See C. Wright et\xc2\xa0al., 18B Federal Practice and Procedure \xc2\xa74478, p. 646, and n.\xc2\xa016 (2d ed. 2002) (collecting cases).  But the doctrine is \xe2\x80\x9csomething of a misnomer\xe2\x80\x9d when used to describe how an appellate court assesses a lower court\xe2\x80\x99s rulings.  <i>United States</i> v. <i>Wells</i>,\n\n519 U.\xc2\xa0S. 482\n, n.\xc2\xa04 (1997).  An appellate court\xe2\x80\x99s function <i>is</i> to revisit matters decided in the trial court.  When an appellate court reviews a matter on which a party failed to object below, its review may well be constrained by other doctrines such as waiver, forfeiture, and estoppel, as well as by the type of challenge that it is evaluating.  But it is not bound by district court rulings under the law-of-the-case doctrine.  That doctrine does not bear on how to assess a sufficiency challenge when a jury convicts a defendant after being instructed\xe2\x80\x94without an objection by the Government\xe2\x80\x94on all charged elements of a crime plus an additional element.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">III</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">We now consider whether a defendant may successfully raise the statute-of-limitations bar in\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73282(a) for the first time on appeal.  Musacchio argues that he may do so, either because \xc2\xa73282(a) imposes a nonwaivable limit on federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 subject-matter jurisdiction or because a previously unraised limitations claim may constitute plain error that can be noticed on appeal.  We disagree with both points, and hold that a defendant cannot successfully raise this statute-of-limitations bar for the first time on appeal.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">A</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Statutes of limitations and other filing deadlines \xe2\x80\x9cordinarily are not jurisdictional.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Sebelius</i> v. <i>Auburn Regional Medical Center</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 8).

Rather, the statutory text, context, and history establish that \xc2\xa73282(a) imposes a nonjurisdictional defense that becomes part of a case only if a defendant raises it in the district court.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The statutory text suggests that \xc2\xa73282(a) does not impose a jurisdictional limit.  Section 3282(a) provides:</p>\n<p style="p-BQOnly1Para">\xe2\x80\x9cExcept as otherwise expressly provided by law, no person shall be prosecuted, tried, or punished for any offense, not capital, unless the indictment is found or the information is instituted within five years next after such offense shall have been committed.\xe2\x80\x9d</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Although \xc2\xa73282(a) uses mandatory language, it does not expressly refer to subject-matter jurisdiction or speak in jurisdictional terms.  The text of \xc2\xa73282(a) does not, therefore, provide a \xe2\x80\x9cclear indication that Congress wanted that provision to be treated as having jurisdictional attributes.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Henderson,</i> <i>supra</i>, at 439.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">Context confirms that \xc2\xa73282(a) does not impose a jurisdictional limit.  Federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 general criminal subject-matter jurisdiction comes from\n\n18 U.\xc2\xa0S.\xc2\xa0C. \xc2\xa73231, which states: \xe2\x80\x9cThe district courts .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. shall have original jurisdiction .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. of all offenses against the laws of the United States.\xe2\x80\x9d  Section 3231 speaks squarely to federal courts\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction,\xe2\x80\x9d in marked contrast to \xc2\xa73282(a), which does not mention \xe2\x80\x9cjurisdiction\xe2\x80\x9d or a variant of that term.  And, nothing in \xc2\xa73231 \xe2\x80\x9cconditions its jurisdictional grant on\xe2\x80\x9d compliance with \xc2\xa73282(a)\xe2\x80\x99s statute of limitations.  <i>Reed Elsevier</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 165.  This context supports the conclusion that \xc2\xa73282(a) is not jurisdictional.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">The history of the limitations bar in \xc2\xa73282(a) demonstrates that it is a defense that becomes part of a case only if the defendant presses it in the district court.  This Court held in <i>United States</i> v. <i>Cook</i>, 17 Wall. 168 (1872), that a statute of limitations\xe2\x80\x94identical in all relevant respects to \xc2\xa73282(a)\xe2\x80\x94was \xe2\x80\x9ca matter of defence and must be pleaded or given in evidence by the accused.\xe2\x80\x9d  <i>Id.</i>, at 181; see \xc2\xa732,\n\n1Stat.\n119 (statute of limitations); see also <i>Cook</i>, <i>supra,</i> at 173, and n.\xc2\xa0* (citing and describing statute of limitations).  When a defendant introduces the limitations defense into the case, the Government then has \xe2\x80\x9cthe right to reply or give evidence\xe2\x80\x9d on the limitations claim.  17 Wall., at 179.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT"><i>Cook</i> was decided more than 140 years ago, and we have adhered to its holding.  Just three Terms ago, we reaffirmed that \xe2\x80\x9c[c]ommission of [a federal] crime within the statute-of-limitations period is not an element of the .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0. offense,\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9cit is up to the defendant to raise the limitations defense.\xe2\x80\x9d<i>  Smith</i> v. <i>United States</i>, 568 U.\xc2\xa0S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (citing <i>Cook</i>;<i> </i>emphasis deleted); see also <i>Biddinger</i> v. <i>Commissioner of Police of City of New York</i>,\n\n245 U.\xc2\xa0S. 128,\n135 (1917)\n (\xe2\x80\x9cThe statute of limitations is a defense and must be asserted on the trial by the defendant in criminal cases .\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0.\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d (citing <i>Cook</i>)).  There is, in sum, a long history of treating the operative language in \xc2\xa73282(a) as providing a nonjurisdictional defense that a defendant must press at trial to insert into the case.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">In keeping with \xc2\xa73282(a)\xe2\x80\x99s text, context, and history, we conclude that \xc2\xa73282(a) provides a nonjurisdictional defense, not a jurisdictional limit.</p>\n<p style="p-H1">B</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT-D">Because \xc2\xa73282(a) does not impose a jurisdictional limit, the failure to raise it at or before trial means that it is reviewable on appeal\xe2\x80\x94if at all\xe2\x80\x94only for plain error.  See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 52(b) (providing for consideration of \xe2\x80\x9c[a] plain error that affects substantial rights\xe2\x80\x9d even though the error \xe2\x80\x9cwas not brought to the court\xe2\x80\x99s attention\xe2\x80\x9d).  We conclude, however, that a district court\xe2\x80\x99s failure to enforce an unraised limitations defense under \xc2\xa73282(a) cannot be a plain error.[<a href="#F3" name="T3">3</a>]</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">As explained above, a statute-of-limitations defense becomes part of a case only if the defendant puts the defense in issue.  When a defendant presses a limitations defense, the Government <i>then</i> bears the burden of establishing compliance with the statute of limitations by presenting evidence that the crime was committed within the limitations period or by establishing an exception to the limitations period.  See <i>Cook</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 179.  When a defendant fails to press a limitations defense, the defense does not become part of the case and the Government does not otherwise have the burden of proving that it filed a timely indictment.  When a defendant does not press the defense, then, there is no error for an appellate court to correct\xe2\x80\x94and certainly no plain error.</p>\n<p style="p-CASCT">A defendant thus cannot successfully raise the statute-of-limitations defense in \xc2\xa73282(a) for the first time on appeal.
