      "<p>Petitioner, Gloria Rodriguez, was arrested for selling cocaine.  While released on a personal recognizance bond, she was arrested again, for selling heroin.  She pleaded guilty to both charges.  The sentencing judge recognized that § 3147 [<a href=\"#F1\" name=\"T1\">Footnote 1</a>] required that petitioner be sentenced to at least a 2-year term of imprisonment in addition to the sentences for the two drug offenses.  Nevertheless, relying on § 3651, [<a href=\"#F2\" name=\"T2\">Footnote 2</a>] he suspended execution of that sentence, finding that, under the circumstances, a 2-year probation term was more appropriate.  The United States appealed, arguing that § 3147 had superseded § 3651, and that the sentencing judge had no authority to suspend execution of the sentence imposed under § 3147.  The Court of Appeals agreed with the United States, and reversed.  794 F.2d 24 (CA2 1986).  Rodriguez then filed this petition for certiorari. </p><p><a class=\"page-number\" name=\"524\">Page 480 U.

Nothing in the language of these two provisions suggests the existence of the \"irreconcilable conflict,\" <em>Kremer v.

S. 468</a></span> (1982) (citations omitted), from which an intent to repeal may be inferred.  To the contrary, the provisions fit together quite sensibly.  Section 3147 requires that those who commit felonies while on release be sentenced to a term of at least two years; § 3651 authorizes sentencing judges to suspend execution of those sentences if probation would be more appropriate.  Section 3147 is no different from many other federal statutes requiring minimum sentences, which have uniformly been held to be subject to the suspension authority of § 3651.  <em>See, e.g., Andrews v. United States,</em> <span class=\"l-leftover\"><a href=\"/cases/federal/us/373/334/case.html\">373 U.

      "<p>The Court of Appeals rested its conclusion in part on the legislative history of the CCCA, noting that various Senate and House Reports referred to § 3147 as establishing a \"mandatory\" sentence, as prescribing a \"term of imprisonment of at least two years and not more than ten,\" and as \"requir[ing] that the individual be imprisoned for an additional period of </p><p><a class=\"page-number\" name=\"525\">Page 480 U. S. 525</a></p><p> time.\"  <em>See</em> 794 F.2d at 26-29.  Even if unrebutted, these passing references would not constitute the \"clear and manifest\" evidence of congressional intent necessary to establish repeal by implication.  In fact, however, the totality of the legislative history of the Act demonstrates with unusual clarity that no repeal was intended.  A Senate Report on an early version of the Act pointed out that statutes specifying minimum sentences did not create mandatory minimum terms of confinement, since such sentences could be suspended in favor of probation or parole.  S.Rep. No. 98-225, p. 66, n. 129 (1983).  The same Report also noted that the reported version of the provision eventually codified at 18 U.S.C. § 924(c) would permit such suspension, and recommended that it be amended to eliminate that possibility.  S.Rep. at 312-313.  Congress subsequently did amend § 924(c), as well as certain other provisions of the CCCA, to make § 3651 unambiguously inapplicable.  <em>See</em> 18 U.S.C. §§ 924(c), 929(a) (1982 ed., Supp. III); 18 U.S.C.App. § 1202 (a); 21 U.S.C. § 845a(c) (1982 ed., Supp. III).</p>\n",
      "<p>\"'[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\"</p>\n",

Wong Kim Bo,</em> 472 F.2d 720, 722 (CA5 1972)).  It is, in short, overwhelmingly clear that, in passing the CCCA, Congress acted -- as it is presumed to act, <em>see, e.g., Lorillard v. Pons,</em> <span class=\"l-leftover\"><a href=\"/cases/federal/us/434/575/case.html\">434 U.

Donovan, supra,</em> at 64.</p>\n",
      "<p>Additionally, and most impermissibly, the Court of Appeals relied on its understanding of the broad purposes of the CCCA, which included decreasing the frequency with which persons on pretrial release commit crimes and diminishing the sentencing discretion of judges.

Deciding what competing values will or will not be sacrificed to the achievement of a particular objective is the very essence of legislative choice -- and it frustrates, rather than effectuates, legislative intent simplistically to assume that <em>whatever</em> furthers the statute's primary objective must be the law.
